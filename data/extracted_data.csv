0,The molecular mechanisms between metabolic syndrome and breast cancer,"Metabolic syndrome, which is extremely common in developed and some developing countries, is a clustering of at least three of five of the following medical conditions: abdominal obesity, elevated blood pressure, elevated fasting plasma glucose, high serum triglycerides, and low high-density lipoprotein levels. It has been proved that there is a strong association between metabolic syndrome and breast cancer. Metabolic syndrome could increase the risk of breast cancer and influence the prognosis of the breast cancer patients. Some characteristic of metabolic syndrome such as obesity and lack of physical exercise are all risk factors for developing breast cancer. The metabolic syndrome mainly include obesity, type 2 diabetes, hypercholesterolemia and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, and each of them impacts the risk of breast cancer and the prognosis of the breast cancer patients in different ways. In this Review, we focus on recently uncovered aspects of the immunological and molecular mechanisms that are responsible for the development of this highly prevalent and serious disease. These studies bring new insight into the complex associations between metabolic syndrome and breast cancer and have led to the development of novel therapeutic strategies that might enable a personalized approach in the management of this disease.

1,Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease promotes breast cancer progression through upregulated hepatic fibroblast growth factor 21,"Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) has been shown to influence breast cancer progression, but the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. In this study, we investigated the impact of NAFLD on breast cancer tumor growth and cell viability through the potential mediator, hepatic fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21). Both peritumoral and systemic administration of FGF21 promoted breast cancer tumor growth, while FGF21 knockout attenuated the tumor-promoting effects of the high-fat diet. Mechanistically, exogenous FGF21 treatment enhanced the anti-apoptotic ability of breast cancer cells through STAT3 and Akt/FoXO1 signaling pathways, and mitigated doxorubicin-induced cell death. Furthermore, we observed overexpression of FGF21 in tumor tissues from breast cancer patients, which was associated with poor prognosis. These findings suggest a novel role for FGF21 as an upregulated mediator in the context of NAFLD, promoting breast cancer development and highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target for cancer treatment.",10.1038/s41419-023-06386-8,"Sui, Y; Liu, QQ; Xu, C; Ganesan, K; Ye, Z; Li, Y; Wu, JM; Du, B; Gao, F; Song, CL; Chen, JP"
2,Underlying nonalcoholic fatty liver disease is a significant factor for breast cancer recurrence after curative surgery,"Breast cancer is the most common cancer among women worldwide, and it is a main cause of death in women. As with breast cancer, metabolic components are important risk factors for the development of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). In this retrospective cohort study, we aimed to determine the prevalence of NAFLD in patients with breast cancer and the impact of NAFLD on the prognosis of breast cancer. Patients with breast cancer were enrolled in the study from January 2007 to June 2017. Hepatic steatosis was evaluated through non-enhanced computed tomography scan by measuring Hounsfield Units in the liver and spleen, respectively; 123 healthy controls who underwent non-enhanced computed tomography scan were also analyzed. The prevalence of NAFLD in patients with breast cancer was 15.8% (251/1587), which was significantly higher than in healthy controls (8.9%, 11/123) (P=.036). Overall survival did not significantly differ between the groups with and without NAFLD (P=.304). However, recurrence-free survival was significantly higher in patients without NAFLD than in those with NAFLD (P=.009). Among breast cancer patients receiving endocrine treatment, the NAFLD group showed a higher cumulative incidence of significant liver injury than the group without NAFLD (P<.001). The prevalence of NAFLD in patients with breast cancer is significantly higher than in healthy controls. Moreover, breast cancer patients with NAFLD showed poorer prognosis in terms of recurrence. Therefore, diagnostic evaluation for NALFD is important in managing patients with breast cancer.",10.1097/MD.0000000000017277,"Lee, YS; Lee, HS; Chang, SW; Lee, CU; Kim, JS; Jung, YK; Kim, JH; Seo, YS; Yim, HJ; Lee, CH; Woo, SU; Seo, JH; Yeon, JE; Um, SH; Byun, KS"
3,"Comorbidities and Malignancy among NAFLD Patients Compared to the General Population, A Nation-Based Study","(1) Background: Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a common liver disease. Aims: We aimed to investigate the frequency of comorbidities and malignancies among NAFLD patients compared to the general population. (2) Methods: A retrospective study included adult patients with a NAFLD diagnosis. A control group was matched for age and gender. Demographics, comorbidities, malignancies, and mortality were collected and compared. (3) Results: 211,955 NAFLD patients were analyzed in comparison to 452,012 matched general population controls. Significantly higher rates of diabetes mellitus (23.2% vs. 13.3%), obesity (58.8% vs. 27.8%), hypertension (57.2% vs. 39.9%), chronic ischemic heart disease (24.7% vs. 17.3%), and CVA (3.2% vs. 2.8%) were found among NAFLD patients. Patients with NAFLD had significantly higher rates of the following malignancies: prostate cancer (1.6% vs. 1.2%), breast cancer (2.6% vs. 1.9%), colorectal cancer (1.8% vs. 1.4%), uterine cancer (0.4 vs. 0.2%), kidney cancer (0.8% vs. 0.5%), but a lower rate of lung cancer (0.9% vs. 1.2%) and stomach cancer (0.3% vs. 0.4%). The all-cause mortality rate among NAFLD patients was significantly lower in comparison to the general population (10.8% vs. 14.7%, p < 0.001). (4) Conclusions: Higher rates of comorbidities and malignancies among NAFLD patients were observed, but a lower rate of all-cause mortality was found.",10.3390/biomedicines11041110,"Abu-Freha, N; Cohen, B; Gordon, M; Weissmann, S; Fich, A; Munteanu, D; Yardeni, D; Etzion, O"
4,Tamoxifen induces fatty liver disease in breast cancer through the MAPK8/FoxO pathway,"Background Prevention of metabolic complications of long-term adjuvant endocrine therapy in breast cancers remained a challenge. We aimed to investigate the molecular mechanism in the development of tamoxifen (TAM)-induced fatty liver in both estrogen receptor (ER)-positive and ER-negative breast cancer. Methods and results First, the direct protein targets (DPTs) of TAM were identified using DrugBank5.1.7. We found that mitogen-activated protein kinase 8 (MAPK8) was one DPT of TAM. We identified significant genes in breast cancer and fatty liver disease (FLD) using the MalaCards human disease database. Next, we analyzed the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathways of those significant genes in breast cancer and FLD using the Search Tool for the Retrieval of Interacting Genes/Proteins (STRING). We found that overlapping KEGG pathways in these two diseases were MAPK signaling pathway, Forkhead box O (FoxO) signaling pathway, HIF-1 signaling pathway, AGE-RAGE signaling pathway in diabetic complications, and PI3K-Akt signaling pathway. Furthermore, the KEGG Mapper showed that the MAPK signaling pathway was related to the FoxO signaling pathway. Finally, the functional relevance of breast cancer and TAM-induced FLD was validated by Western blot analysis. We verified that TAM may induce fatty liver in breast cancer through the MAPK8/FoxO signaling pathway. Conclusion Bioinformatics analysis combined with conventional experiments may improve our understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying side effects of cancer drugs, thereby making this method a new paradigm for guiding future studies on this issue.",10.1002/ctm2.5,"Gong, LY; Tang, HM; Luo, ZZ; Sun, X; Tan, XY; Xie, LN; Lei, YTT; Cai, MJ; He, CC; Ma, JL; Han, SX"
5,Relationship between Non-Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease and Breast Cancer,"Background: Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a chronic liver disease which refers to the presence of hepatic steatosis. Breast cancer is now the most common cancer in women and is the leading cause of death from cancer among women. Objectives: To assess the relationship between NAFLD and newly diagnosed cases of breast cancer. Methods: The results of mammography screening examinations in women referred to the Breast Center, Holy Family Hospital, Nazareth during a 4 year period were collected. We identified cases of women who were newly diagnosed with breast cancer and who underwent abdominal computed tomography (CT) within 1 month of the diagnosis. The control group comprised women with normal mammography and breast ultrasonography who underwent abdominal CT within 3 months from the date of the breast cancer screening during the same study period. The control cases were matched by age and body mass index (BMI). We compared the cases with the controls in terms of the presence of diffuse hepatic fatty liver and other known risk factors for breast cancer. Results: Of the 133 women with new diagnosis of cancer, 73 were eligible for the study. NAFLD was found in 33 of the women with breast cancer and in 12 in the control group (45.2% vs.16.4%, respectively, P = 0.002). Multivariate analysis showed NAFLD (odds ratio 2.82, 95% confidence interval 1.2-5.5, P = 0.016) to be associated with breast cancer. Conclusions: NAFLD is associated with breast cancer.",,"Nseir, W; Abu-Rahmeh, Z; Tsipis, A; Mograbi, J; Mahamid, M"
6,TMED family genes and their roles in human diseases,"The members of the transmembrane emp24 domain-containing protein (TMED) family are summarized in human as four subfamilies, alpha (TMED 4, 9), beta (TMED 2), gamma (TMED1, 3, 5, 6, 7) and delta (TMED 10), with a total of nine members, which are important regulators of intracellular protein transport and are involved in normal embryonic development, as well as in the pathogenic processes of many human diseases. Here we systematically review the composition, structure and function of TMED family members, and describe the progress of TMED family in human diseases, including malignancies (head and neck tumors, lung cancer, breast cancer, ovarian cancer, endometrial cancer, gastrointestinal tumors, urological tumors, osteosarcomas, etc.), immune responses, diabetes, neurodegenerative diseases, and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, dilated cardiomyopathy, mucin 1 nephropathy (MKD), and desiccation syndrome (SS). Finally, we discuss and prospect the potential of TMED for disease prognosis prediction and therapeutic targeting, with a view to laying the foundation for therapeutic research based on TMED family causative genes.",10.7150/ijms.87272,"Zhou, L; Li, HX; Yao, H; Dai, XL; Gao, P; Cheng, HW"
7,Assessment of hepatic steatosis on contrast enhanced computed tomography in patients with colorectal cancer,"Aims: Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease is often seen in patients with colorectal cancer. Insulin resistance and metabolic syndrome are related to increased risk of colorectal cancer. The aim of this study was to quantitatively determine the relationship between non-alcoholic fatty liver disease and colorectal cancer with the examination of routine abdominopelvic computed tomography images taken for staging. Methods: A retrospective evaluation was made of the colonoscopy and histopathology reports of 1630 patients who presented for a scanning or diagnostic colonoscopy examination. Colorectal cancer was determined histopathologically in 129 cases. Colorectal cancer patients with distant metastasis or additional malignancies were excluded from the study. A total of 105 patients met the criteria and were included in the study. A control group was formed of 94 patients with no history of cancer. The liver density on abdominopelvic computed tomography and serum transaminase values were recorded for the patients and compared with those of the control group. Results: The groups were similar in respect of age, gender and aspartate aminotransferase levels. Although not statistically significant, the alanine aminotransferase levels of the patient group were high compared to the control group. The liver density on computed tomography was statistically significantly lower in the patient group than in the control group. Conclusion: The liver density measurement on contrast abdominopelvic computed tomography of colorectal cancer patients was low, which is consistent with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease.",,"Aktas, E; Uzman, M; Yildirim, O; Sahin, B; Buyukcam, F; Aktas, B; Yilmaz, B; Yildirim, AM; Basyigit, S; Yeniova, O; Kefeli, A; Aribas, BK"
8,Obesity and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease associated with adenocarcinoma in patients with lung cancer,"Lung cancer has become the leading cause of cancer-related deaths around the world. In addition to genetic risk factors and smoking, the metabolic risk factors remain to be elusive. To evaluate the associations between obesity, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and pulmonary adenocarcinoma in patients with lung cancer. Consecutive operation-proven lung cancer patients with assessment of metabolic disorders and liver ultrasound in 2009 and 2013 were retrospectively enrolled. T-test and multivariate logistic regression were applied to evaluate the contribution of individual factors to lung adenocarcinoma, as well as the synergistic effects between these factors. Among 3664 lung cancer patients with ultrasound examination, 2844 cases were enrolled for further analysis. Of them, 1053 (37.0%) were females, 1242 (43.7%) were cigarette smokers, 1658 (58.3%) were diagnosed as lung adenocarcinoma, 744 (26.2%) had obesity, and 614 (21.6%) had NAFLD. Proportion of female gender, nonsmoker, obesity, NAFLD, and serum lipid levels in patients with adenocarcinoma were significantly higher than those in other subtypes of lung cancer, and in 2013 than in 2009 (all P<.01). NAFLD and obesity were shown as independent factors and positively associated with pulmonary adenocarcinoma, along with female gender and nonsmoking, higher serum levels of cholesterol. NAFLD and other contributing factors exhibited no synergistic effects on adenocarcinoma. Obesity and NAFLD might increase the risk for pulmonary adenocarcinoma, especially in nonsmoking females, and underscore the need for further study into carcinogenic mechanisms and preventive interventions.",10.1097/MD.0000000000017098,"Zhu, CY; Qu, JC; Cao, HX; Chen, GY; Shi, YH; Fan, JG"
9,"Development of a risk-stratification scoring system for predicting risk of breast cancer based on non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, non-alcoholic fatty pancreas disease, and uric acid","Many breast cancer patients have both non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and non-alcoholic fatty pancreas disease (NAFPD). Consequently, we hypothesized that NAFPD and NAFLD were associated with breast cancer, and aimed to build a novel risk-stratification scoring system based on it. In this study, a total of 961 patients with breast cancer and 1,006 non-cancer patients were recruited. The clinical characteristics were collected and analyzed using logistic analysis. Risk factors were assessed by a risk rating system. Univariate analysis showed that body mass index, triglyceride, total cholesterol, NAFLD, NAFPD, low-density lipoprotein, and uric acid (UA) were significantly related to breast cancer. Among them, NAFLD, NAFPD, and UA were independent risk factors related to breast cancer identified by multivariate analysis. The risk assessment model was established based on these factors and demonstrated that the odds ratio sharply increased with the rising scores. Compared with the low-risk group, the odds ratio in the intermediate- and high-risk groups were 1.662 (1.380-2.001) and 3.185 (2.145-4.728), respectively. In conclusion, the risk-stratification scoring system combining NAFLD, NAFPD, and UA can accurately predict the occurrence of breast cancer.",10.1515/med-2022-0462,"Hong, CT; Yan, YH; Su, LY; Chen, DB; Zhang, CQ"
10,A meta-analysis of comorbidities in COVID-19: Which diseases increase the susceptibility of SARS-CoV-2 infection?,"Comorbidities in COVID-19 patients often lead to more severe outcomes. The disease-specific molecular events, which may induce susceptibility to Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection, are being investigated. To assess this, we retrieved array-based gene expression datasets from patients of 30 frequently occurring acute, chronic, or infectious diseases. Comparative analyses of the datasets were performed after quantile normalization and log2 transformation. Among the 78 host genes prominently implicated in COVID-19 infection, ACE2 (receptor for SARS-CoV-2) was positively regulated in several cases, namely, leukemia, psoriasis, lung cancer, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), breast cancer, and pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH). FURIN was positively regulated in some cases, such as leukemia, psoriasis, NAFLD, lung cancer, and type II diabetes (T2D), while TMPRSS2 was positively regulated in only 3 cases, namely, leukemia, lung cancer, and T2D. Genes encoding various interferons, cytokines, chemokines, and mediators of JAK-STAT pathway were positively regulated in leukemia, NAFLD, and T2D cases. Among the 161 genes that are positively regulated in the lungs of COVID-19 patients, 99-111 genes in leukemia (including various studied subtypes), 77 genes in NAFLD, and 48 genes in psoriasis were also positively regulated. Because of the high similarity in gene expression patterns, the patients of leukemia, NAFLD, T2D, psoriasis, and PAH may need additional preventive care against acquiring SARS-CoV-2 infections. Further, two genes CARBONIC ANHYDRASE 11 (CA11) and CLUSTERIN (CLU) were positively regulated in the lungs of patients infected with either SARS-CoV-2, or SARSCoV or Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV).",10.1016/j.compbiomed.2021.104219,"Singh, MK; Mobeen, A; Chandra, A; Joshi, S; Ramachandran, S"
11,Therapeutic potential of Phycocyanin in gastrointestinal cancers and related disorders,"Gastrointestinal cancer is the most fatal cancer worldwide. The etiology of gastrointestinal cancer has yet to be fully characterized. Alcohol consumption, obesity, tobacco, Helicobacter pylori and gastrointestinal disorders, including gastroesophageal reflux disease, gastric ulcer, colon polyps and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease are among the several risks factors for gastrointestinal cancers. Phycocyanin which is abundant in Spirulina. Phycocyanin, a member of phycobiliprotein family with intense blue color, is an anti-diabetic, neuroprotective, anti-oxidative, anti-inflammatory, and anticancer compound. Evidence exists supporting that phycocyanin has antitumor effects, exerting its pharmacological effects by targeting a variety of cellular and molecular processes, i.e., apoptosis, cell-cycle arrest, migration and Wnt/beta-catenin signaling. Phycocyanin has also been applied in treatment of several gastrointestinal disorders such as, gastric ulcer, ulcerative colitis and fatty liver that is known as a risk factor for progression to cancer. Herein, we summarize various cellular and molecular pathways that are affected by phycocyanin, its efficacy upon combined drug treatment, and the potential for nanotechnology in its gastrointestinal cancer therapy.",10.1007/s11033-024-09675-3,"Motamedzadeh, A; Rahmati-Dehkordi, F; Heydari, H; Behnam, M; Noshabad, FZR; Tamtaji, Z; Taheri, AT; Nabavizadeh, F; Aschner, M; Mirzaei, H; Tamtaji, OR"
12,Fatty liver index and development of lung cancer: a nationwide cohort study,"Background/Aims: This study aimed to evaluate the impact of steatotic liver disease severity on the cumulative incidence of lung cancer utilizing data from the Korea National Health Insurance Service (NHIS). Methods: This study examined the risk of lung cancer in the general population in conjunction with the incidence of steatotic liver disease. The study population consisted of 3,261,438 individuals aged 20 years or older who underwent a general health examination in 2009. Results: Individuals with fatty liver index (FLI) of 30-59 exhibited a 1.08-fold increased risk of lung cancer (95% CI: 1.04-1.11), while FLI >= 60 was associated with a 1.22-fold elevated risk of lung cancer (95% CI: 1.17-1.28) compared to those with FLI < 30. The risk varied with smoking status; in current smokers, the adjusted HR for the FLI 30-59 group was 1.05 (95% CI: 1.00-1.10), while that in the FLI >= 60 group was 1.11 (95% CI: 1.04-1.18). In never- or past-smokers, the adjusted HR for the FLI 30-59 group was 1.10, and that for the FLI >= 60 group was 1.31. Subgroup analysis revealed an incidence rate of 1.06 per 1,000 person-years in the consistently high FLI group compared to 1.15 in those with improved FLI. Improving FLI over time was associated with a 0.93-fold decrease in lung cancer risk. Conclusions: Our study demonstrated a correlational relationship between lung cancer incidence and the severity of steatotic liver disease as measured by FLI.",10.3904/kjim.2024.232,"Lim, J; Kim, B; Han, K; Lim, JU"
13,S-Adenosylmethionine: From the Discovery of Its Inhibition of Tumorigenesis to Its Use as a Therapeutic Agent,"Alterations of methionine cycle in steatohepatitis, cirrhosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma induce MAT1A decrease and MAT2A increase expressions with the consequent decrease of S-adenosyl-L-methionine (SAM). This causes non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). SAM administration antagonizes pathological conditions, including galactosamine, acetaminophen, and ethanol intoxications, characterized by decreased intracellular SAM. Positive therapeutic effects of SAM/vitamin E or SAM/ursodeoxycholic acid in animal models with NAFLD and intrahepatic cholestasis were not confirmed in humans. In in vitro experiments, SAM and betaine potentiate PegIFN-alpha-2a/2b plus ribavirin antiviral effects. SAM plus betaine improves early viral kinetics and increases interferon-stimulated gene expression in patients with viral hepatitis non-responders to pegIFN alpha/ribavirin. SAM prevents hepatic cirrhosis, induced by CCl4, inhibits experimental tumors growth and is proapoptotic for hepatocellular carcinoma and MCF-7 breast cancer cells. SAM plus Decitabine arrest cancer growth and potentiate doxorubicin effects on breast, head, and neck cancers. Furthermore, SAM enhances the antitumor effect of gemcitabine against pancreatic cancer cells, inhibits growth of human prostate cancer PC-3, colorectal cancer, and osteosarcoma LM-7 and MG-63 cell lines; increases genomic stability of SW480 cells. SAM reduces colorectal cancer progression and inhibits the proliferation of preneoplastic rat liver cells in vivo. The discrepancy between positive results of SAM treatment of experimental tumors and modest effects against human disease may depend on more advanced human disease stage at moment of diagnosis.",10.3390/cells11030409,"Pascale, RM; Simile, MM; Calvisi, DF; Feo, CF; Feo, F"
14,A Scientometric Study to a Critical Review on Promising Anticancer and Neuroprotective Compounds: Citrus Flavonoids,"Flavonoids derived from citrus plants are favored by phytomedicinal researchers due to their wide range of biological activities, and relevant studies have been sustained for 67 years (since the first paper published in 1955). In terms of a scientometric and critical review, the scientometrics of related papers, chemical structures, and pharmacological action of citrus flavonoids were comprehensively summarized. The modern pharmacological effects of citrus flavonoids are primarily focused on their anticancer activities (such as breast cancer, gastric cancer, lung cancer, and liver cancer), neuroprotective effects (such as anti-Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease), and metabolic diseases. Furthermore, the therapeutic mechanism of cancers (including inducing apoptosis, inhibiting cell proliferation, and inhibiting cancer metastasis), neuroprotective effects (including antioxidant and anti-inflammatory), and metabolic diseases (such as non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, type 2 diabetes mellitus) were summarized and discussed. We anticipate that this review could provide an essential reference for anti-cancer and neuroprotective research of citrus flavonoids and provide researchers with a comprehensive understanding of citrus flavonoids.",10.3390/antiox12030669,"Qiu, MY; Wei, WL; Zhang, JQ; Wang, HZ; Bai, YX; Guo, DA"
15,Selective Estrogen Receptor Modulator-Associated Nonalcoholic Fatty Liver Disease Improved Survival in Patients With Breast Cancer <i>A Retrospective Cohort Analysis</i>,"Selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM)-associated nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) might be related to treatment efficacy in patients with breast cancer because of circulating estrogen antagonism.The aim of the study was to investigate the relationship between NAFLD and survival outcomes in patients with breast cancer who were treated with tamoxifen or toremifene.This single-center, retrospective, cohort study included 785 eligible patients who received tamoxifen or toremifene, after curative resection for breast cancer, at the Sun Yat-sen University Cancer Center between January 2005 and December 2009. Data were extracted from patient medical records. All patients underwent abdominal ultrasonography, at least once, at baseline and at the annual follow-up. Patients who were diagnosed with NAFLD on ultrasonography were classified into the NAFLD or the non-NAFLD arm at the 3-year follow-up visit. Univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses were conducted to evaluate any associations between NAFLD and disease-free survival (DFS) or overall survival (OS).One hundred fifty-eight patients were diagnosed with NAFLD. Patients who developed NAFLD had better DFS and OS compared with those who did not. Univariate analyses revealed that the 5-year DFS rates were 91.56% and 85.01% for the NAFLD and non-NAFLD arms, respectively (hazard ratio [HR], 0.59; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.37-0.96; log-rank P=0.032). The 5-year OS rates were 96.64% and 93.31% for the NAFLD and non-NAFLD arms, respectively (HR, 0.39; 95% CI, 0.16-0.99; log-rank P=0.039). Multivariate analysis revealed that NAFLD was an independent prognostic factor for DFS, improving the DFS rate by 41% compared with that in the non-NAFLD arm (HR, 0.59; 95% CI, 0.36-0.96; P=0.033).SERM-associated NAFLD was independently associated with improved DFS and might be useful for predicting treatment responses in breast cancer patients treated with SERMs.",10.1097/MD.0000000000001718,"Zheng, QF; Xu, F; Nie, M; Xia, W; Qin, T; Qin, G; An, X; Xue, C; Peng, RJ; Yuan, ZY; Shi, YX; Wang, SS"
16,Recent progress of lysophosphatidylcholine acyltransferases in metabolic disease and cancer,"With the rapid development of the economy, the updating of different diseases, especially metabolic diseases and cancers, is increasingly rapid and the difficulty of curing diseases is becoming greater. Lysophosphatidylcholine acyltransferase (LPCAT) has been shown to be more likely to participate in the development of related diseases. In the present review, we mainly focused on progress of the role of LPCAT in metabolic diseases and cancers and wish to provide new points to prevent and treat metabolic diseases and cancers. Related research of LPCAT in metabolic diseases, inflammatory diseases, and cancers have been reviewed. LPCAT 1-4 have different roles in metabolic diseases, such as diabetes, hyperlipidemia, hyperglycemia, and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis. Furthermore, LPCAT1 has been an independent predictor of early tumor recurrence and represents a novel prognostic biomarker for hepatocellular carcinoma, gastric cancer, breast cancer, oral squamous cell carcinoma, prostate cancer, colorectal cancer, and clear cell renal cell carcinoma. LPCAT2 is recognized as a novel aggressive prostate cancer susceptibility gene, and LPCAT4 participates in the elevated expression of PC (16:0/16:1) in colorectal cancer. LPCATs will provide a foundation for potential novel therapeutic approaches and highlight the important role of phospholipid metabolism in the prevention and treatment of metabolic diseases and cancers.",,"Shi, CZ; Qiao, SX; Wang, SY; Wu, T; Ji, G"

18,Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease and colorectal cancer,"As a significant cause of cancer death worldwide, colorectal cancer (CRC) is still one of the most common cancers in the world. The most efficient strategies to reduce CRC incidence include identifying risk factors for CRC and performing a preventive colonoscopy in high-risk populations. Some well-established risk factors for CRC development include hereditary syndromes and inflammatory bowel disease. Of note, in recent years, attention has been given to new evidence indicating that more than 75%-95% of CRC occurs in individuals with little or no genetic risk. For these individuals, the risk for CRC is associated with their lifestyle and dietary factors, including central obesity, overweight and physical inactivity. Recently, evidence demonstrated a connection between non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and CRC. Insulin resistance and metabolic syndrome (MetS) are common risks that NAFLD and colorectal neoplasms share. The incidence of NAFLD is increasing in parallel with an increasing prevalence of MetS and obesity. Consequently, the question arises: will the incidence of CRC increase together with this dramatic increase in obesity, MetS and ultimately NAFLD prevalence? Recent studies of adenomatous polyps, CRC and NAFLD are discussed in this manuscript.",10.1136/postgradmedj-2016-134383,"Mikolasevic, I; Orlic, L; Stimac, D; Hrstic, I; Jakopcic, I; Milic, S"
19,Impact of visceral obesity on infectious complications after resection for colorectal cancer: a retrospective cohort study,"Objectives To explore the impact of visceral obesity (VO) measured by preoperative abdominal computed tomography (CT) on postoperative infectious complications for colorectal cancer (CRC) patients and establish a predictive model. Methods Patients who underwent resection for colorectal cancer between January 2015 and January 2021 were enrolled in this study. All patients were measured for body mass index (BMI) and visceral fat area (VFA) preoperatively. Infectious complications were compared between the different groups according to BMI and VO categories. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression were used to analyze whether VO was an independent risk factor for postoperative infectious complications. According to the results of logistic regression, six machine learning approaches were used to establish predictive models and perform internal validation. The best-performing model was interpreted by the SHAPley Additive exPlanations value. Results Approximately 64.81% of 520 patients had VO. VO was significantly connected with postoperative infectious complications (P < 0.001), coronary heart disease (P = 0.004), cerebral infarction (P = 0.001), hypertension (P < 0.001), diabetes (P < 0.001), and fatty liver (P < 0.001). The rates of wound infection (P = 0.048), abdominal or pelvic infection (P = 0.006), and pneumonia (P = 0.008) increased obviously in patients with VO. Compared to the low BMI group, a high BMI was found to be significantly associated with hypertension (P=0.007), fatty liver (P<0.001), and a higher rate of postoperative infection (P=0.003). The results of logistic regression revealed that VO (OR = 2.01, 95% CI 1.17 similar to 3.48, P = 0.012), operation time >= 4 h (OR = 2.52, 95% CI 1.60 similar to 3.97, P < 0.001), smoking (OR = 2.04, 95% CI 1.16 similar to 3.59, P = 0.014), ostomy (OR = 1.65, 95% CI 1.04 similar to 2.61, P = 0.033), and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) (OR = 2.23, 95% CI 1.09 similar to 4.57, P = 0.029) were independent risk factors. The light gradient boosting machine (LGBM) model displayed the largest area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) (0.74, 95% CI 0.68 similar to 0.81). Conclusions In this study, VO was superior to BMI in evaluating the influence of obesity on metabolic comorbidities and postoperative infectious complications in colorectal cancer patients.",10.1186/s12944-023-01890-4,"Zhai, WS; Yang, Y; Zhang, KY; Sun, L; Luo, M; Han, X; Wang, M; Wang, ZP; Gao, F"
20,Association between tamoxifen treatment and the development of different stages of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease among breast cancer patients,"Background/Purpose: For estrogen-receptor positive breast cancer cases, tamoxifen has been the most important adjuvant hormonal therapy for the purpose of reducing recurrence rates and prolonging disease free survival. However, several side effects have been noticed, and fatty liver is one of the most common side effects among them. Since fatty liver is a common problem in the general population, we wanted to examine the effects of tamoxifen under pre-existing fatty liver conditions and evaluate the prevalence of tamoxifen-related impaired liver function. Methods: We recruited breast cancer cases at ages 20-70 years and divided them into tamoxifen or control groups. Personal information was collected, and fasting blood tests and abdominal ultrasound were performed. The changes of fatty liver degree between the initial and follow-up ultrasound were divided into five categories. Results: Of the 406 enrolled participants, 266 were in the tamoxifen group and 140 were in the control group. The tamoxifen group had a higher risk of newly developed fatty liver [hazard ratio (HR) = 3.69; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.67-8.13), lower rate of improved fatty liver (HR = 0.33; 95% CI 0.15-0.75), and higher rate of worsened fatty liver (HR = 2.11; 95% CI 1.02-4.35). Conclusion: The current study suggests that tamoxifen treatment is associated with the risk of fatty liver either by increasing the risk of newly developed fatty liver conditions or worsening previous fatty liver conditions, and even retarding fatty liver improvement.

21,"Long-term comparisons of the efficacy, safety, and pregnancy outcomes of adjuvant tamoxifen plus ovarian function suppression in premenopausal Han and Zhuang Chinese patients with hormone receptor-positive early breast cancer","Objective To compare the efficacy, safety, and pregnancy outcomes of tamoxifen plus ovarian function suppression (OFS) between Han and Zhuang women with hormone receptor-positive breast cancer. Methods A total of 236 Han and 101 Zhuang women with hormone receptor-positive breast cancer who received tamoxifen plus OFS were analyzed retrospectively. Long-term disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS) were evaluated by Kaplan-Meier analysis, and adverse events and pregnancy outcomes were assessed by chi(2) and Fisher's exact-probability tests. Results There was no significant difference in DFS or OS between Han and Zhuang women (5-year DFS 74.57% and 77.23%, OS 85.59% and 90.01%, respectively). The incidences of endometrial hyperplasia, ovarian cysts, nausea and vomiting, fatty liver, retinitis, and thrombocytopenic purpura were similar in both groups, but Zhuang women had significantly more allergic reactions (6.93% vs. 2.12%). Pregnancy rates among women who attempted pregnancy were similar (Han, 7/138, 5.07%; Zhuang, 2/46, 4.35%). Conclusions OFS plus tamoxifen resulted in similar DFS and OS among premenopausal Han and Zhuang women with hormone receptor-positive breast cancer. However, Zhuang women were more likely to experience an allergic reaction. For women with fertility concerns, OFS plus tamoxifen was associated with similar pregnancy rates in Zhuang and Han women.",10.1177/0300060518807100,"Tang, SC; Zhang, Q; Tang, XH; Chen, D; Zhang, F; Liu, JL; Wei, W; Liu, DQ"
22,Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease and colorectal cancer: Correlation and missing links,"Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is one of the major metabolic diseases that occur in almost one in every four global population, while colorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the leading causes of cancer related deaths in the world. Individuals with pre-existing NAFLD show a higher rate of developing CRC and liver metastasis, suggesting a causal relationship. Interestingly, both of these diseases are strongly associated with obesity, which is also a growing global health concern. In this current review, we will explore scientific findings that demonstrate the relationship between NAFLD, CRC and obesity, as well as the underlying mechanisms. We will also indicate the missing links and knowledge gaps that require more in-depth investigation.",10.1016/j.lfs.2020.118507,"Chakraborty, D; Wang, J"
23,Association between nonalcoholic fatty liver disease and extrahepatic cancers: a systematic review and meta-analysis,"Background NAFLD is tightly associated with various diseases such as diabetes, cardiovascular disease, kidney disease, and cancer. Previous studies had investigated the association between NAFLD and various extrahepatic cancers, but the available data to date is not conclusive. The aim of this study was to investigate the association between NAFLD and various extrahepatic cancers comprehensively. Methods Searches were conducted of various electronic databases (PubMed, EMBASE, Medline, and the Cochrane Library) to identify observational studies published between 1996 and January 2020 which investigated the association between NAFLD and extrahepatic cancers. The pooled OR/HR/IRR of the association between NAFLD and various extrahepatic cancers were analyzed. Results A total of 26 studies were included to investigate the association between NAFLD and various extrahepatic cancers. As the results shown, the pooled OR values of the risk of colorectal cancer and adenomas in patients with NAFLD were 1.72 (95%CI: 1.40-2.11) and 1.37 (95%CI: 1.29-1.46), respectively. The pooled OR values of the risk of intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma and extrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma in patients with NAFLD were 2.46 (95%CI: 1.77-3.44) and 2.24 (95%CI: 1.58-3.17), respectively. The pooled OR value of the risk of breast cancer in patients with NAFLD was 1.69 (95%CI: 1.44-1.99). In addition, NAFLD was also tightly associatied with the risk of gastric cancer, pancreatic cancer, prostate cancer, and esophageal cancer. Conclusions NAFLD could significantly increase the development risk of colorectal adenomas and cancer, intrahepatic and extrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma, breast, gastric, pancreatic, prostate, and esophageal cancer. NAFLD could be considered as one of the influencing factors during the clinical diagnosis and treatment for the extrahepatic cancers.",10.1186/s12944-020-01288-6,"Liu, SS; Ma, XF; Zhao, J; Du, SX; Zhang, J; Dong, MZ; Xin, YN"
24,Alterations in hepatic fatty acids reveal depletion of total polyunsaturated fatty acids following irinotecan plus 5-fluorouracil treatment in an animal model of colorectal cancer,"Fatty liver is a side effect of chemotherapy that limits the ability to treat colorectal cancer (CRC) patients in the most effective way. The aim of this study was to determine hepatic fatty acid composition and expression of genes involved in lipid metabolism at two time points following sequential chemotherapy treatment with Irinotecan (CPT-11)+5-fluorouracil (5-FU), agents commonly used to treat human colorectal cancer. Female Fischer 344 rats were provided a semi-purified AIN-76 basal diet with modified fat component. One cycle of chemotherapy consisted of CPT-11+5-FU and was initiated 2 weeks after tumor implantation (D0); a second cycle was given one week later. Two days after each cycle (Day 2 and Day 9), animals were euthanized, and livers collected. Triacylglycerol (TAG) and phospholipid (PL) fractions were isolated using thin layer chromatography and fatty acids (FAs) were quantified using gas chromatography. Expression of 44 lipid metabolism genes were analyzed by qPCR. Total liver TAG level was lowest after the second cycle D0 and D2 (P = 0.05) characterized by lower content of n-6 and n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs). N-6 PUFAs significantly declined with subsequent treatments. Of 44 genes analyzed, 13 genes were altered with CPT-11+5-FU treatment. Expression of genes VLCAD and DGAT1, involved in fatty acid oxidation as well as DGAT1 in TAG synthesis, were significantly elevated after each cycle, whereas expression of genes ELOVL2 and FADS2, involved in fatty acid elongation and desaturation were significantly lower at D9 compared to D2 and D0 (P < 0.03). Hepatic total TAG PUFA was depleted, and genes involved in pathways of PUFA synthesis were down-regulated by chemotherapy treatment. This observation suggests impediments in lipid metabolism in the liver that could potentially impact peripheral availability of essential fatty acids.",10.1016/j.plefa.2021.102359,"Monirujjaman, M; Pant, A; Nelson, R; Bathe, O; Jacobs, R; Mazurak, VC"
25,Reversible severe fatty liver induced by capecitabine A case report,"Rationale: Capecitabine (CAP) is a chemotherapeutic agent used to treat breast and gastrointestinal cancers. The most common adverse reactions of CAP primarily included gastrointestinal and dermatological effects. Whereas, the CAP-induced fatty liver had never been reported. Patientconcerns: In this study, a-69-year old female presented a history of hypertension with regulated blood pressure, whereas diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidemia, and hepatitis were excluded. No alcohol, tobacco, or other drugs use was declared. Diagnoses: She was diagnosed as infiltrating ductal carcinoma of left breast with the hepatic and pulmonary metastasis. The dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase (DPD) deficiency is not involved. Interventions: She received treatment with CAP that was administered orally at a dosage of 1500mg twice daily intermittently (2weeks on/1 week off). The treatment was well-tolerated any typical adverse reactions such as diarrhea, nausea, and hand-foot syndrome (HFS) were noted. The parameters of the functional liver, the total cholesterol, and triglyceride were in normal ranges before and after therapy. After 3 cycles of the treatment, computed tomography (CT) scan revealed signs of fatty liver. After a 10-cycle course, CAP was substituted with tamoxifen because of the further aggravation of fatty liver. Outcomes: Several months after withdrawal, the follow-up CT scans demonstrated significant improvement of fatty liver. Lessons: We presented a case of breast cancer with severe fatty liver as a consequence of the administration of CAP that was not involved in DPD deficiency or CAP-associated hypertriglyceridemia; these potential adverse effects of therapy with CAP should be intensely investigated.",10.1097/MD.0000000000008547,"Jiang, YY; He, QC; Li, SX; Shi, C; Yang, XL"
26,Chemopreventive effects of atractylenolide-III on mammary tumorigenesis via activation of the Nrf2/ARE pathway through autophagic degradation of Keap1,"The incidence of breast cancer is increasing annually, making it a major health threat for women. Chemoprevention using natural, dietary, or synthetic products has emerged as a promising approach to address this growing burden. Atractylenolide-III (AT-III), a sesquiterpenoid present in various medicinal herbs, has demonstrated potential therapeutic effects against several diseases, including tumors, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, and cerebral ischemic injury. However, its impact on breast cancer chemoprevention remains unexplored. In this study, we used an N-methyl-N-nitrosourea (NMU)-induced rat breast cancer model and 17 beta-estradiol (E2)treated MCF-10A cells to evaluate the chemopreventive potential of AT-III on mammary tumorigenesis. AT-III inhibited mammary tumor progression, evidenced by reduced tumor volume and multiplicity, prolonged tumor latency, and the reversal of NMU-induced weight loss. Furthermore, AT-III suppressed NMU-induced inflammation and oxidative stress through the Nrf2/ARE pathway in breast cancer tissues. In vitro, AT-III effectively suppressed E2-induced anchorage-independent growth and cell migration in MCF-10A cells. Nrf2 knockdown attenuated the protective effects of AT-III, highlighting the pivotal role of Nrf2 in AT-III-mediated suppression of tumorigenesis. The mechanism involves the induction of Nrf2 expression by AT-III through the autophagic degradation of Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1 (Keap1). Overall, the results of this study indicate that AT-III is a promising candidate for breast cancer chemoprevention and provide valuable insights into its molecular interactions and signaling pathways.",10.1016/j.biopha.2024.116852,"Long, FY; Wang, PH; Ma, Y; Zhang, XD; Wang, T"
27,Nonalcoholic Fatty Liver Disease <i>A Negative Risk Factor for Colorectal Cancer Prognosis</i>,"Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is known to be associated with an increased risk of colorectal cancer (CRC). However, the relationship between NAFLD and the prognosis of CRC remains unclear. The primary objective of this study was to evaluate the overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) rates in patients with CRC and the secondary objective was to compare clinicopathologic variables which were stratified by NAFLD. We performed a large cohort study of 1314 patients who were first diagnosed with CRC between January 2006 and April 2011. Postoperative follow-up data were collected from out-patient medical records, telephone consultations, and social security death indices. The Kaplan-Meier method was used to calculate the cumulative survival rate. Clinicopathologic variables were analyzed by univariate analysis and multivariate analysis through a Cox proportional hazard regression model. The mean follow-up time was 52.7 +/- 25.3 months. Upon baseline comparison, the NAFLD group had significantly higher values of body mass index, triglycerides, and uric acid and significantly lower values of high-density lipoprotein, compared with the non-NAFLD group (P < 0.05 for all). There were no significant differences between the 2 groups with regard to tumor location, TNM staging, tumor differentiation, carcinoembryonic antigen, and vascular invasion. The cumulative 1-, 3-, and 5-year OS rates were 96.1%, 85.2%, and 80.6%, respectively, in the NAFLD group, which were statistically significantly higher than the OS rates of 91.6%, 76.2%, and 67.8%, respectively, in the non-NAFLD group (P = 0.075, P = 0.002, P = 0.030, respectively). There was no difference in DFS rates between the CRC patients with and without NAFLD (P = 0.267). Multivariate analysis showed that the presence of NAFLD was an independent negative risk factor for OS after adjusting for clinicopathologic covariates (hazard ratio = 0.593; 95% confidence interval 0.442, 0.921; P = 0.020), but not for DFS (P = 0.270). NAFLD may play a protective role in OS for CRC patients. Further studies are needed to elucidate the molecular mechanisms of putative protective effects in CRC patients with NAFLD.",10.1097/MD.0000000000000479,"You, J; Huang, S; Huang, GQ; Zhu, GQ; Ma, RM; Liu, WY; Shi, KQ; Guo, GL; Chen, YP; Braddock, M; Zheng, MH"
28,The Biology of Leptin and Its Implications in Breast Cancer: A General View,"Obesity is a world health problem that increases the risk for developing type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease, fatty liver, and some types of cancer. In postmenopausal women, it represents an important risk factor for the development of breast cancer (BC). Leptin is an adipokine that is secreted by fatty tissue, and high leptin levels are observed both in mouse models of obesity and in obese subjects. High levels of leptin promote the proliferation and progression of various types of cancer, including BC. This review provides a general overview of the biology of leptin, important laboratory studies, and animal and clinical models that have provided evidence for an active role of leptin in the proliferation, progression, and survival of mammary tumors. Finally, this review addresses the most recent studies on the use of leptin receptor antagonists as a novel therapeutic treatment for BC.",10.1089/jir.2012.0168,"García-Robles, MJ; Segura-Ortega, JE; Fafutis-Morris, M"
29,Association between nonalcoholic fatty liver disease and colorectal cancer: A population-based study,"Colorectal cancer (CRC) and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) have high prevalence rates and place a considerable burden on the health-care industry. The association between both diseases is controversial. Our aim was to examine the association between NAFLD and CRC. Using data extracted from the Taiwan National Health Insurance Research Database (NHIRD) from 2000 to 2015, we enrolled 60 298 patients with NAFLD. Of these, 52,986 met the inclusion criteria. A comparison group was selected using 4-fold propensity score matching by age, sex, and year of index date. The primary outcome was the cumulative incidence of CRC in patients with NAFLD. Over a mean follow-up period of 8.5 years, 160 new cases of CRC were identified. The incidence rate of CRC was higher in the NAFLD group (12.23 per 100,000 person-years) than in the comparison cohort (6.0 per 100,000 person-years). Cox proportional hazards regression analysis revealed that the adjusted hazard ratio (HR) of CRC was 1.259 in the study group (95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.047-1.486, P = .003). Using Kaplan-Meier analysis, we ascertained that the cumulative incidence of CRC was significantly high in the NAFLD group. Patients older than 50 years, with diabetes mellitus (DM), and with chronic liver disease also exhibited a high risk of CRC. NAFLD was associated with a high risk of CRC. CRC occurs more frequently in patients with NAFLD aged between 50 and 59 years and those older than 60 years with comorbidities, including DM and chronic liver disease. Physicians should consider the subsequent risk of CRC when treating patients with NAFLD.",10.1097/MD.0000000000033867,"Wu, PH; Chung, CH; Wang, YH; Hu, JM; Chien, WC; Cheng, YC"
30,Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease promotes liver metastasis of colorectal cancer via fatty acid synthase dependent EGFR palmitoylation,"Liver metastasis is the major reason for most of colorectal cancer (CRC) related deaths. Accumulating evidence indicates that CRC patients with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) are at a greater risk of developing liver metastasis. With the growing prevalence of NAFLD, a better understanding of the molecular mechanism in NAFLD-driven CRC liver metastasis is needed. In this study, we demonstrated that NAFLD facilitated CRC liver metastasis as a metabolic disorder and promoted the stemness of metastatic CRC cells for their colonization and outgrowth in hepatic niches. Metabolically, the lipid-rich microenvironment in NAFLD activated de novo palmitate biosynthesis in metastatic CRC cells via upregulating fatty acid synthase (FASN). Moreover, increased intracellular palmitate bioavailability promoted EGFR palmitoylation to enhance its protein stability and plasma membrane localization. Furthermore, we demonstrated that the FDA-approved FASN inhibitor orlistat could reduce NAFLD-activated endogenous palmitate production, thus inhibiting palmitoylation of EGFR to suppress CRC cell stemness and restrict liver metastasis in synergy with conventional chemotherapy. These findings reveal that the NAFLD metabolic microenvironment boosts endogenous palmitate biosynthesis in metastatic CRC cells and promotes cell stemness via EGFR palmitoylation, and FASN inhibitor orlistat could be a candidate adjuvant drug to suppress liver metastasis in CRC patients with NAFLD.",10.1038/s41420-023-01770-x,"Zhang, C; Zhang, Y; Dong, Y; Zi, RY; Wang, YJ; Chen, YR; Liu, CX; Wang, JY; Wang, XS; Li, JJ; Liang, HJ; Ou, JJ"
31,"Association between high fatty liver index and development of colorectal cancer: a nationwide cohort study with 21,592,374 Korean","Background/Aims: In Korea, the incidence of colorectal cancer (CRC) and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) has increased due to a westernized lifestyle. This study investigated whether a high fatty liver index that reflects NAFLD correlates with CRC. Methods: Data from the National Health Insurance Corporation 2009 to 2012 were analyzed. NAFLD disease was defined as a fatty liver index > 60 in the absence of alcohol consumption of a >= 30 g/day. Results: NAFLD was identified in 2,543,649 (11.8%) of 21,592,374 participants. CRC was identified in 19,785 (0.8%) of participants with NAFLD (fatty liver index >= 60) and in 80,871 (0.6%) participants without NAFLD (fatty liver index < 30). Multivariate logistic regression analysis demonstrated an independent association between NAFLD and CRC after adjusting for other confounders (hazard ratio, 1.13; odds ratio, 1.12 to 1.15). In subgroup analyses, fatty liver index >= 60 was associated with CRC regardless of body mass index, but the association was more prominent in persons with a normal index. NAFLD, in the absence of diabetes, hypertension, or dyslipidemia, was more highly associated with CRC than when one or more of these conditions are present. Conclusions: CRC should be considered as a possibility in patients with fatty liver index >= 60, even in the absence of obesity or other metabolic syndromes.",10.3904/kjim.2018.022,"Choi, YJ; Lee, DH; Han, KD"
32,Alcohol as a health risk: new recommendations for dealing with alcohol,"Background: Chronic alcohol consumption is related to more than 200 disorders. Up until now, limits for low-risk use of alcohol were 24 g/ day for men and 12 g/ day for women. Recent epidemiologic studies have shown that any alcohol may be harmful.Aim: The aim of this review is to reassess the health risk of alcohol.Results: There is a linear relationship between the amount of alcohol consumed and mortality risk. No risk-free dose of alcohol exists. However, health risk varies not only with the amount of alcohol consumed but also with target organs, as well as individual genetic and non-genetic factors such as smoking, medication use, exposure to environmental toxins, and pre-existing disease that deteriorates with alcohol use. High-risk groups for the damaging effect of alcohol include children and adolescents, old people, and women. Diseases that are affected by alcohol even at a low dose include arterial hypertension, cardiac arrhythmia (extrasystole, arterial fibrillation), some liver diseases (non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, hepatitis C, porphyria) as well as breast cancer. For these disorders, a threshold of low risk does not exist. Finally, in addition to breast cancer, alcohol is a risk factor for cancer of the oral cavity, the larynx, pharynx, oesophagus, liver, and colorectum. During pregnancy alcohol is completely forbidden.Conclusion: There is no such thing as a risk-free dose of alcohol.",10.1007/s00108-023-01574-2,"Seitz, HK; John, U"
33,Unraveling the Role of Hepatic PGC1a in Breast Cancer Invasion: A New Target for Therapeutic Intervention?,"Breast cancer (BC) is the most common cancer among women worldwide and the main cause of cancer deaths in women. Metabolic components are key risk factors for the development of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), which may promote BC. Studies have reported that increasing PGC1a levels increases mitochondrial biogenesis, thereby increasing cell proliferation and metastasis. Moreover, the PGC1a/ERRa axis is a crucial regulator of cellular metabolism in various tissues, including BC. However, it remains unclear whether NAFLD is closely associated with the risk of BC. Therefore, the present study aimed to determine whether hepatic PGC1a promotes BC cell invasion via ERRa. Various assays, including ELISA, western blotting, and immunoprecipitation, have been employed to explore these mechanisms. According to the KM plot and TCGA data, elevated PGC1a expression was highly associated with a shorter overall survival time in patients with BC. High concentrations of palmitic acid (PA) promoted PGC1a expression, lipogenesis, and inflammatory processes in hepatocytes. Conditioned medium obtained from PA-treated hepatocytes significantly increased BC cell proliferation. Similarly, recombinant PGC1a in E0771 and MCF7 cells promoted cell proliferation, migration, and invasion in vitro. However, silencing PGC1a in both BC cell lines resulted in a decrease in this trend. As determined by immunoprecipitation assay, PCG1a interacted with ERRa, thereby facilitating the proliferation of BC cells. This outcome recognizes the importance of further investigations in exploring the full potential of hepatic PGC1a as a prognostic marker for BC development.",10.3390/cells12182311,"Ganesan, K; Xu, C; Liu, QQ; Sui, Y; Chen, JP"
34,Remission of Nonalcoholic Fatty Liver Disease After Radical Surgery in Patients with Colorectal Cancer: A Single-Center Retrospective Study,"Purpose: The purpose of this study was to investigate the relationship between remission of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and radical surgery for colorectal cancer (CRC) patients. Methods: From January 2014 to December 2021, data of patients with concurrent CRC and NAFLD who underwent radical surgery in a single -center hospital were retrospectively collected. NAFLD was defined as a mean computed tomography (CT) liver attenuation value of <40 Hounsfield units (HUs). Comparison of preoperative and 1 -year postoperative CT images was performed to evaluate the change of NAFLD. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was performed to identify independent predictive factors for NAFLD remission. The Kaplan-Meier method was used to estimate overall survival (OS) and disease -free survival (DFS) between the remission group and no remission group. Results: In this study, a total of 55 eligible patients were included. The remission group had 33 (60.0%) patients and the no remission group had 22 (40.0%) patients. The mean preoperative weight was 66.1 +/- 9.9 kg. The mean preoperative body mass index (BMI) was 25.4 +/- 2.5 kg/m(2). We found that the average weight was significantly decreased (P <0.01), average BMI was significantly decreased (P < 0.01), and HU score was significantly increased (P <0.01). By comparing baseline characteristics between the remission group and no remission group, we found that the remission group exhibited larger tumor sizes (P = 0.036) than the no remission group. In the multivariate logistic regression analysis, we found that weight change was a predictor for NAFLD (odds ratio = 0.764, 95% confidence interval = 0.618-0.944, P =0.013). We did not find any statistically significant differences in OS (P = 0.182) or DFS (P = 0.248) between the remission group and no remission group. Conclusions: The NAFLD remission rate reached 60.0% for CRC patients 1 year after radical surgery.

36,Fatostatin inhibits SREBP2-mediated cholesterol uptake via LDLR against selective estrogen receptor α modulator-induced hepatic lipid accumulation,"Estrogen receptor alpha (ER alpha) plays a key role in the adaptive response of liver metabolism to energy demands, especially in controlling lipid metabolism. Tamoxifen (TMX), a main drug for the treatment of ER-positive breast cancer in clinical, is a selective ER modulator (SERM). However, accordingly, the long-term use of TMX would lead to nonalcoholic fatty liver (NAFLD) in clinical, which had no definite treatment up to now. Fatostatin (Fato), an inhibitor of sterol-regulatory element binding protein 2 (SREBP2), was reported as a synergistic inhibitor of ER-positive breast cancer with TMX, but the hepatic lipid regulation of this combination is still unknown. Herein, we aimed to explore the effect and mechanism of Fato against TMX-induced NAFLD. The results identified that hepatic cholesterol content increase was the main reason for TMX-induced NAFLD. It was caused by the upregulation of circulating cholesterol uptake mediated by low density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) in liver, which resulted from the activation of SREBP2. Meanwhile, Fato could inhibit activation of SREBP2-LDLR pathway, alleviating TMX-induced hepatic cholesterol accumulation. In summary, these results provided a new insight into the mechanism of TMX-induced NAFLD. Moreover, it supported the combination of Fato and TMX for the treatment of ER-positive breast cancer to reduce the adverse effect of TMX in clinical.",10.1016/j.cbi.2022.110091,"Li, M; Lu, Q; Zhu, YP; Fan, X; Zhao, W; Zhang, LY; Jiang, ZZ; Yu, QW"
37,Network based approach to identify interactions between Type 2 diabetes and cancer comorbidities,"High blood sugar and insulin insensitivity causes the lifelong chronic metabolic disease called Type 2 diabetes (T2D) which has a higher chance of developing different malignancies. T2D with comorbidities like Cancers can make normal medications for those disorders more difficult. There may be a significant correlation between comorbidities and have an impact on one another's health. These associations may be due to a number of direct and indirect mechanisms. Such molecular mechanisms that underpin T2D and cancer are yet unknown. However, the large volumes of data available on these diseases allowed us to use analytical tools for uncovering their interrelated pathways. Here, we tried to present a system for investigating potential comorbidity relationships between T2D and Cancer disease by looking at the molecular processes involved, analyzing a huge number of freely accessible transcriptomic datasets of various disorders using bioinformatics. Using semantic similarity and gene set enrichment analysis, we created an informatics pipeline that evaluates and integrates Gene Ontology (GO), expression of genes, and biological process data. We discovered genes that are common in T2D and Cancer along with molecular pathways and GOs. We compared the top 200 Differentially Expressed Genes (DEGs) from each selected T2D and cancer dataset and found the most significant common genes. Among all the common genes 13 genes were found most frequent. We also found 4 common GO terms: GO:0000003, GO:0000122, GO:0000165, and GO:0000278 among all the common GO terms between T2d and different cancers. Using these genes and GO term semantic similarity, we calculated the distance between these two diseases. The semantic similarity results of our study showed a higher association of Liver Cancer (LiC), Breast Cancer (BreC), Colorectal Cancer (CC), and Bladder Cancer (BlaC) with T2D. Furthermore we found KIF4A, NUSAP1, CENPF, CCNB1, TOP2A, CCNB2, RRM2, HMMR, NDC80, NCAPG, and IGFBP5 common hub proteins among different cancers correlated to T2D.

38,Fasting hyperglycaemia and fatty liver drive colorectal cancer: a retrospective analysis in 1145 patients,"Background Metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD) represents the hepatic manifestation of increased adiposopathy, whose pathogenetic features have been proposed as tumourigenic triggers for colorectal cancer (CRC). We aim to identify specific metabolic signatures involved in CRC development that may be used as non-invasive biomarkers, paving the way for specific and personalized strategies of CRC prevention and early detection.Methods We retrospectively assessed CRC onset during a time frame of 8 years in a cohort of 1145 out-patients individuals who had previously been evaluated for Metabolic Syndrome.Results 28 patients developed CRC. No association between CRC development and visceral and general obesity was detected, while baseline fasting plasma glucose (FPG) and non-invasive liver fibrosis scores were significantly higher in patients with CRC, compared to those who did not develop cancer. Liver steatosis and MASLD were more frequently diagnosed in patients who developed CRC compared to no cancer developers. Canonical correlations among metabolic biomarkers were not present in CRC developers, differently from no cancer group. In ROC analysis, FPG and non-invasive scores also showed good sensitivity and specificity in predicting colon cancer. We then calculated ORs for metabolic biomarkers, finding that higher FPG and non-invasive scores were associated with an increased risk of developing CRC.Conclusion MASLD and increased FPG may play a role in the clinical background of CRC, bringing to light the fascinating possibility of a reversed gut-liver axis communication in the pathogenesis of CRC. Thus, the use of non-invasive scores of fatty liver may be helpful to predict the risk of CRC and serve as novel prognostic factors for prevention and therapeutic strategies.",10.1007/s11739-024-03596-6,"Crudele, L; De Matteis, C; Novielli, F; Petruzzelli, S; Di Buduo, E; Graziano, G; Cariello, M; Piccinin, E; Gadaleta, RM; Moschetta, A"
39,Polydatin down-regulates the phosphorylation level of STAT3 and induces pyroptosis in triple-negative breast cancer mice with a high-fat diet,"Background: To explore the impact of polydatin on mice with triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) receiving a high-fat diet, as well as the underlying processes. Methods: A total of 40 female Balb/c mice were randomly separated into 4 groups (4T1+polydatin+fat diet group, 4T1+high-fat diet group, 4T1+polydatin group, and 4T1 group). To establish the obese TNBC mouse model, TNBC was xenografted 1x105 4T1 cells/50 mu L per mouse at the right fourth mammary fat pad under anesthesia and the mice were fed a high fat diet. When the experiment was completed, total plasma cholesterol (TC) and cancer antigen (CA)15-3 were measured. The enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) method was used detect CA15-3. Oil red O staining was used to observe the morphological changes. Western blot analysis and reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) were used to detect the corresponding protein expression and the messenger RNA (mRNA) level. Results: Polydatin decreased the degree of fatty liver, as determined by oil red O staining. The TC level in the 4T1+fat diet group was significantly higher, and it was decreased in the 4T1+polydatin group. The results of ELISA showed that compared with the 4T1 group, CA15-3 was significantly increased in the 4T1+fat diet group, and polydatin was shown to significantly reduce the expression of CA15-3. Polydatin inhibited p-JAK2 and p-STAT3 mRNA and protein levels. Polydatin increased pyroptosis-related gene mRNA and protein level. Conclusions: We believe that polydatin can effectively reduce blood lipid levels in TNBC mice with a high-fat diet, and play an anticancer role in TNBC. The underlying mechanism may be related to the JAK2/ STAT3 signaling pathway and pyroptosis in TNBC. Our results contribute to validating the traditional use of polydatin in the treatment of TNBC with hyperlipidemia.",10.21037/atm-22-73,"Liu, M; Li, YA; Kong, BT; Zhang, GL; Zhang, Q"
40,Hepatic lipids promote liver metastasis,"Obesity predisposes to cancer and a virtual universality of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). However, the impact of hepatic steatosis on liver metastasis is enigmatic. We find that while control mice were relatively resistant to hepatic metastasis, those which were lipodystrophic or obese, with NAFLD, had a dramatic increase in breast cancer and melanoma liver metastases. NAFLD promotes liver metastasis by reciprocal activation initiated by tumor-induced triglyceride lipolysis in juxtaposed hepatocytes. The lipolytic products are transferred to cancer cells via fatty acid transporter protein 1, where they are metabolized by mitochondrial oxidation to promote tumor growth. The histology of human liver metastasis indicated the same occurs in humans. Furthermore, comparison of isolates of normal and fatty liver established that steatotic lipids had enhanced tumor-stimulating capacity. Normalization of glucose metabolism by metformin did not reduce steatosis-induced metastasis, establishing the process is not mediated by the metabolic syndrome. Alternatively, eradication of NAFLD in lipodystrophic mice by adipose tissue transplantation reduced breast cancer metastasis to that of control mice, indicating the steatosis-induced predisposition is reversible.",10.1172/jci.insight.136215,"Li, YJ; Su, XM; Rohatgi, N; Zhang, Y; Brestoff, JR; Shoghi, KI; Xu, YL; Semenkovich, CF; Harris, CA; Peterson, LL; Weilbaecher, KN; Teitelbaum, SL; Zou, W"
41,Farnesoid X Receptor (FXR) from normal to malignant state,"The Farnesoid X Receptor (FXR) is a member of the nuclear receptor superfamily of ligand-activated transcription factors, which plays crucial role in bile acid, cholesterol, lipid and glucose metabolism, as well as in the development of atherosclerosis, intestinal bacterial growth and liver regeneration. FXR is also involved in the pathogenesis of cholestatic diseases, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease and inflammatory bowel disease. Recent evidence further suggests a key role for FXR in apoptosis and cancer. Notably, FXR deficiency promoted intestinal inflammation and tumorigenesis, suggesting that FXR activation might be a promising strategy in the treatment of colon cancer. FXR deficiency in mice led to the development of spontaneous hepatocarcinomas, while FXR inhibition might represent a novel therapeutic approach in Barett's esophagus. In breast cancer cell lines, FXR agonists down-regulated the breast cancer target gene aromatase. FXR inhibited Leydig tumor growth and progression, supporting evidence that FXR may be an important regulator of androgen homoeostasis. Further studies are required in order to establish possible antitumor effects of this nuclear receptor. Either reactivating or inhibiting FXR expression may represent promising therapeutic strategies in the treatment of certain types of human cancer.",,"Koutsounas, I; Giaginis, C; Theocharis, S"
42,"Metabolic syndrome, obesity, and the risk of cancer development","Background: Metabolic syndrome and its components are severe global health issues that are increasing in frequency as the prevalence of obesity increases. Various studies have established a correlation between metabolic syndrome and diseases including, diabetes mellitus, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, cirrhosis, and cardiovascular disease. In recent years, correlations have also been detected between obesity and metabolic syndrome and the prevalence of certain types of cancer. The current study examines whether obesity and metabolic syndrome components are risk factors for cancer among the adult population in Israel. Methods: A cohort study analysis was performed of 24,987 initially healthy men and women who underwent yearly medical assessments at the Institute for Medical Screening in the Sheba Medical Center. Data from the Institute for Medical Screening database was correlated with that from the Israel Cancer Center in the Ministry of Health updated to December 2013. The correlation between metabolic syndrome, obesity, and the overall risk of cancer as well as the risks of specific types of cancer were examined. Results: Of 20,444 subjects for whom complete data were available, 1535 were diagnosed with cancer during the mean follow-up time of 104.3 months. In a multi-variant analysis, no significant correlation was found between metabolic syndrome or obesity and the incidence of cancer. When the data were stratified by gender and cancer type, however, a significant association between metabolic syndrome and breast cancer in women was observed (P = 0.03, HR = 1.67, 95% CI = 1.05-2.67). Conclusion: Metabolic syndrome correlates with higher than expected breast cancer incidence in women. (C) 2016 European Federation of Internal Medicine. Published by Elsevier B.V.

43,Liver imaging features by convolutional neural network to predict the metachronous liver metastasis in stage I-III colorectal cancer patients based on preoperative abdominal CT scan,"BackgroundIntroducing deep learning approach to medical images has rendered a large amount of un-decoded information into usage in clinical research. But mostly, it has been focusing on the performance of the prediction modeling for disease-related entity, but not on the clinical implication of the feature itself. Here we analyzed liver imaging features of abdominal CT images collected from 2019 patients with stage I - III colorectal cancer (CRC) using convolutional neural network (CNN) to elucidate its clinical implication in oncological perspectives.ResultsCNN generated imaging features from the liver parenchyma. Dimension reduction was done for the features by principal component analysis. We designed multiple prediction models for 5-year metachronous liver metastasis (5YLM) using combinations of clinical variables (age, sex, T stage, N stage) and top principal components (PCs), with logistic regression classification. The model using ""1(st) PC (PC1) + clinical information"" had the highest performance (mean AUC=0.747) to predict 5YLM, compared to the model with clinical features alone (mean AUC=0.709). The PC1 was independently associated with 5YLM in multivariate analysis (beta=-3.831, P<0.001). For the 5-year mortality rate, PC1 did not contribute to an improvement to the model with clinical features alone. For the PC1, Kaplan-Meier plots showed a significant difference between PC1 low vs. high group. The 5YLM-free survival of low PC1 was 89.6% and the high PC1 was 95.9%. In addition, PC1 had a significant correlation with sex, body mass index, alcohol consumption, and fatty liver status.ConclusionThe imaging features combined with clinical information improved the performance compared to the standardized prediction model using only clinical information. The liver imaging features generated by CNN may have the potential to predict liver metastasis. These results suggest that even though there were no liver metastasis during the primary colectomy, the features of liver imaging can impose characteristics that could be predictive for metachronous liver metastasis.",10.1186/s12859-020-03686-0,"Lee, S; Choe, EK; Kim, SY; Kim, HS; Park, KJ; Kim, D"
44,Effect of tobacco smoking and smoking cessation on plasma lipoproteins and associated major cardiovascular risk factors: a narrative review,"Cigarette smoking, active or passive, kills about 6 million people each year worldwide. Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is responsible for 40% of all smoking-related deaths, lung cancer accounts for 20% of all smoking-related deaths, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease is related to another 20% of deaths. In this narrative review we consider the relationship between cigarette smoking and CVD. We discuss disease states and/or CVD risk factors related to smoking, such as dyslipidaemia, vascular inflammation, endothelial dysfunction, arterial stiffness, insulin resistance, type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), chronic kidney disease (CKD), and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) as well as their complex interrelations. Smoking cessation can correct abnormalities related to smoking; however, success rates are relatively low. In cases of inability to quit, measures to minimize the adverse effects of smoking specifically related to CVD should be taken. Smokers should receive best practice treatment, according to guidelines, as for non-smokers.",10.1185/03007995.2013.827566,"Athyros, VG; Katsiki, N; Doumas, M; Karagiannis, A; Mikhailidis, DP"
45,The Role of AKR1B10 in Physiology and Pathophysiology,"AKR1B10 is a human nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH)-dependent reductase belonging to the aldo-keto reductase (AKR) 1B subfamily. It catalyzes the reduction of aldehydes, some ketones and quinones, and interacts with acetyl-CoA carboxylase and heat shock protein 90 alpha. The enzyme is highly expressed in epithelial cells of the stomach and intestine, but down-regulated in gastrointestinal cancers and inflammatory bowel diseases. In contrast, AKR1B10 expression is low in other tissues, where the enzyme is upregulated in cancers, as well as in non-alcoholic fatty liver disease and several skin diseases. In addition, the enzyme's expression is elevated in cancer cells resistant to clinical anti-cancer drugs. Thus, growing evidence supports AKR1B10 as a potential target for diagnosing and treating these diseases. Herein, we reviewed the literature on the roles of AKR1B10 in a healthy gastrointestinal tract, the development and progression of cancers and acquired chemoresistance, in addition to its gene regulation, functions, and inhibitors.",10.3390/metabo11060332,"Endo, S; Matsunaga, T; Nishinaka, T"
46,Tumor Incidence in Patients with Non-Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease,"Background: The incidence of cancer is increasing worldwide. The role of comorbidities in this development is debated. The aim of this study was to investigate the significance of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) for the incidence of cancer of various kinds in Germany. Methods: Between 2000 and 2015, data on 31 587 patients with established NAFLD were collected for analysis. A control group (n = 31 587) assembled for comparison was matched for sex, age, treating physician, and Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI). Results: By 10 years after the index date, 15.3% of patients with NAFLD and 13.4% of patients in the control group had been diagnosed with cancer (p <0.001). Patients with NAFLD exhibited significantly higher rates of male genital cancers (HR 1.26; 95% confidence interval [1.06; 1.5]; p = 0.008), skin cancer (HR 1.22 [1.07; 1.38]; p = 0.002) and breast cancer (HR 1.2 [1.01; 1.43]; p = 0.036). In this analysis, the rate of hepatocellular carcinoma did not differ between patients with NAFLD and patients without NAFLD (0.19% vs. 0.12%; p = 0.204). Conclusion: NAFLD slightly increases the risk of breast cancer in women, genital cancer in men, and skin cancer irrespective of sex. Thus, NAFLD can be considered a marker of increased cancer risk.",10.3238/arztebl.2020.0719,"Huber, Y; Labenz, C; Michel, M; Wörns, MA; Galle, PR; Kostev, K; Schattenberg, JM"
47,Using Nonlinear Stochastic Evolutionary Game Strategy to Model an Evolutionary Biological Network of Organ Carcinogenesis Under a Natural Selection Scheme,"Molecular biologists have long recognized carcinogenesis as an evolutionary process that involves natural selection. Cancer is driven by the somatic evolution of cell lineages. In this study, the evolution of somatic cancer cell lineages during carcinogenesis was modeled as an equilibrium point (ie, phenotype of attractor) shifting, the process of a nonlinear stochastic evolutionary biological network. This process is subject to intrinsic random fluctuations because of somatic genetic and epigenetic variations, as well as extrinsic disturbances because of carcinogens and stressors. In order to maintain the normal function (ie, phenotype) of an evolutionary biological network subjected to random intrinsic fluctuations and extrinsic disturbances, a network robustness scheme that incorporates natural selection needs to be developed. This can be accomplished by selecting certain genetic and epigenetic variations to modify the network structure to attenuate intrinsic fluctuations efficiently and to resist extrinsic disturbances in order to maintain the phenotype of the evolutionary biological network at an equilibrium point (attractor). However, during carcinogenesis, the remaining (or neutral) genetic and epigenetic variations accumulate, and the extrinsic disturbances become too large to maintain the normal phenotype at the desired equilibrium point for the nonlinear evolutionary biological network. Thus, the network is shifted to a cancer phenotype at a new equilibrium point that begins a new evolutionary process. In this study, the natural selection scheme of an evolutionary biological network of carcinogenesis was derived from a robust negative feedback scheme based on the nonlinear stochastic Nash game strategy. The evolvability and phenotypic robustness criteria of the evolutionary cancer network were also estimated by solving a Hamilton-Jacobi inequality - constrained optimization problem. The simulation revealed that the phenotypic shift of the lung cancer-associated cell network takes 54.5 years from a normal state to stage I cancer, 1.5 years from stage I to stage II cancer, and 2.5 years from stage II to stage III cancer, with a reasonable match for the statistical result of the average age of lung cancer. These results suggest that a robust negative feedback scheme, based on a stochastic evolutionary game strategy, plays a critical role in an evolutionary biological network of carcinogenesis under a natural selection scheme.",10.4137/EBO.S26195,"Chen, BS; Tsai, KW; Li, CW"

49,Respiratory diseases and obesity: special phenotype or independent events: Review,"A combination of factors, including Western European eating habits, physical inactivity and genetic predisposition, lead to a dramatic increase in adipose tissue mass. A special place is occupied by abdominal obesity, in which there is an accumulation of adipose tissue in the mesentery of the small intestine and the omentum. Developing in conditions of visceral obesity, insulin resistance, dyslipidemia and systemic inflammation are one of the key components of the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes mellitus, cardiovascular diseases, non-alcoholic fatty liver and pancreas disease, polycystic ovary disease, some forms of cancer (breast cancer, endometrial cancer, colonic and direct intestines). At the same time, the pathogenetic role of adipose tissue is not limited to its participation in the formation of the cardiometabolic continuum and oncogenesis. The most important role of metabolically active fat in the pathogenesis of many respiratory diseases is known, including bronchial asthma, obstructive sleep apnea and pulmonary hypertension.

Relative excess risks of interaction (RERI), attributable proportion (AP), and synergy index (SI) were applied to evaluate the additive interaction. NAFLD and MetS were significantly correlated with colorectal neoplasm and colorectal cancer (CRC), respectively. The incidence of CRC in NAFLD (+) MetS (+) group was significantly higher than other 3 groups. The result of RERI, AP, and SI indicated the significant additive interaction of NAFLD and MetS on the development of CRC.

51,Vitamin D inhibits tamoxifen-induced non-alcoholic fatty liver disease through a nonclassical estrogen receptor/liver X receptor pathway,"Non-alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD) is one of the common side effects of tamoxifen treatment for estrogen receptor -positive breast cancer, and is representative of disorders of energy metabolism. Fatty liver is induced after tamoxifen (TAM) inhibition of estrogen receptor activity, but the exact mechanism is not clear. This study investigated the effects and mechanisms of TAM -induced steatosis in the liver. The effects and mechanisms of TAM on hepatocyte lipid metabolism were assessed using C57BL/6 female mice and human hepatoma cells. TAM promoted fat accumulation in the liver by upregulation of Srebp-1c expression. Regarding the molecular mechanism, TAM promoted the recruitment of the auxiliary transcriptional activator, p300, and dissociated the auxiliary transcriptional repressor, nuclear receptor corepressor (NCOR), of the complexes, which led to enhancement of Srebp-1c transcription and an increase of triglyceride (TG) synthesis. Vitamin D (VD), a common fat-soluble vitamin, can decrease TAM -induced NAFLD by promoting p300 dissociation and NCOR recruitment. Tamoxifen promoted the recruitment and dissociation of co -transcription factors on the LXR/ER/RXR receptor complex, leading to a disorder of liver lipid metabolism. VD interfered with TAM -induced liver lipid metabolism disorders by reversing this process.",10.1016/j.cbi.2024.110865,"Wu, MX; Wang, J; Zhou, WQ; Wang, MT; Hu, CY; Zhou, M; Jiao, KL; Li, Z"

Fatty liver promotes liver metastasis, but the underlying mechanism remains unclear. We demonstrated that hepatocyte-derived extracellular vesicles (EVs) in fatty liver enhanced the progression of CRC liver metastasis by promoting oncogenic Yes-associated protein (YAP) signaling and an immunosuppressive microenvironment. Fatty liver upregulated Rab27a expression, which facilitated EV production from hepatocytes. In the liver, these EVs transferred YAP signaling-regulating microRNAs to cancer cells to augment YAP activity by suppressing LATS2. Increased YAP activity in CRC liver metastasis with fatty liver promoted cancer cell growth and an immunosuppressive microenvironment by M2 macrophage infiltration through CYR61 production. Patients with CRC liver metastasis and fatty liver had elevated nuclear YAP expression, CYR61 expression, and M2 macrophage infiltration.

In this study, we used bioinformatics and network pharmacology methods to explore the differentially expressed genes of NASH and the related genes of type 2 diabetes mellitus, and a total of 46 common targets were obtained. Gene ontology showed that the common targets were mainly involved in biological processes such as glucocorticoid, hormone, and bacterium responses. The Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes enrichment analysis signal pathways were mainly in colorectal cancer, amphetamine addition, the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor signaling pathway, and the toll-like receptor signaling pathway. The protein-protein interaction network identified 8 hub genes, and the co-expression network was analyzed to obtain 7 related functions and mutual proportions of hub genes. A total of 120 transcription factors were predicted for hub genes. Hub genes were closely related to immune cells, including neutropils and eosinophils. In addition, we identified 15 potential candidate drugs based on hub genes that are promising for the treatment of NASH. Type 2 diabetes mellitus can affect the progression of NASH by changing hormone levels and inflammatory responses through multiple targets and signaling pathways.

57,Complications of Non-Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease in Extrahepatic Organs,"Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is now recognized as the most common chronic liver disease worldwide, along with the concurrent epidemics of metabolic syndrome and obesity. Patients with NAFLD have increased risks of end-stage liver disease, hepatocellular carcinoma, and liver-related mortality. However, the largest cause of death among patients with NAFLD is cardiovascular disease followed by extrahepatic malignancies, whereas liver-related mortality is only the third cause of death. Extrahepatic complications of NAFLD include chronic kidney disease, extrahepatic malignancies (such as colorectal cancer), psychological dysfunction, gastroesophageal reflux disease, obstructive sleep apnea syndrome, periodontitis, hypothyroidism, growth hormone deficiency, and polycystic ovarian syndrome. The objective of this narrative review was to summarize recent evidences about extrahepatic complications of NAFLD, with focus on the prevalent/incident risk of such diseases in patients with NAFLD. To date, an appropriate screening method for extrahepatic complications has not yet been determined.

58,WW domain-binding protein 2 overexpression prevents diet-induced liver steatosis and insulin resistance through AMPKβ1,"Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is prevalent clinically and can lead to more serious chronic liver disease. However, the pathological mechanism is still unclear, and thus, there are no approved drugs on the market. Transcriptional coactivator WW domain-binding protein 2 (WBP2) is a newly discovered oncogene that has an important relationship with the occurrence and development of breast cancer and mediates the interaction between Wnt and various other signaling pathways. The expression level of WBP2 was decreased in NAFLD. Overexpression of WBP2 with AAV in vivo alleviated liver fat deposition and insulin resistance induced by a high-fat diet (HFD). Knockdown of WBP2 with AAV aggravated HFD-induced fatty liver and insulin resistance. In vitro experiments showed that in the human normal hepatocyte cell line LO2 and primary hepatocytes isolated from mice, overexpression of WBP2 reduced fat deposition, and knocking out or knocking down WBP2 aggravated PA-induced fat deposition. Through mass spectrometry, we found that WBP2 can bind to AMPK beta 1, and by mutating AMPK beta 1, we found that WBP2 can induce phosphorylation of AMPK beta 1 at S108 and then activate the AMPK pathway to affect lipid metabolism. The effect of WBP2 on NAFLD provides a possible new direction for future research on NAFLD.",10.1038/s41419-021-03536-8,"Zheng, Z; Li, Y; Fan, SY; An, J; Luo, X; Liang, ML; Zhu, F; Huang, K"

The outcome of the above mentioned mechanisms shows potential therapeutic properties of saffron against liver cancer, hepatotoxicity, fatty liver, hyperlipidemia, stomach cancer, peptic ulcer, colon cancer, ulcerative colitis, diabetes and pancreas cancer and ileum contractions. According to global statistics, the susceptibility to intestinal diseases is considered as a significant matter and can be important in health planning in any community. Several strategies for treatment and prevention of the digestive system diseases have provided that the use of herbal remedies seems effective and useful. Considering the available findings, the present study aims to introduce saffron as a prophylactic and therapeutic agent against gastrointestinal tract disorders. However, further clinical studies seem necessary in various aspects of saffron effects in different parts of body to verify these findings.",,"Khorasany, AR; Hosseinzadeh, H"
60,Evaluation of Relationship between Occurrence of Liver Cancer and Methylation of Fragile Histidine Triad (FHIT) and P16 Genes,"Background: We examined the level of fragile histidine triad (FHIT) and p16 gene methylation in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma and explored the relationship to liver cancer. Material/Methods: There were 56 patients with primary liver cancer who were admitted to the hospital from July 2015 to October 2017 included in the liver cancer group, and 24 non-hepatoma patients (hepatitis A/hepatitis B/hepatitis C, liver cirrhosis, liver fibrosis, and fatty liver, alcoholic liver identified as a control group. Fasting venous blood samples were collected from the 2 groups. Methylation-specific PCR (MSP) was used to detect the methylation of FHIT and p16 genes in the 2 groups. The risk factors for lung cancer were analyzed by logistic regression. In addition, the effects of FHIT and p16 gene methylation on the diagnostic accuracy of liver cancer were calculated. Results: The incidence of FHIT and p16 methylation in serum from the liver cancer group was 51.8% and 67.9%, respec- tively. The incidence of FHIT and p16 methylation in the non-hepatoma group was 16.7% and 25.0%. There was a statistical statistically correlated with gender, and the methylation of FHIT and p16 genes (P<0.05). From logistic regression analysis results, methylation of p16 and FHIT genes was an independent risk factor for hepatocellular carcinoma with odds ratio (OR) values of 10.550 (2.313 similar to 48.116) and 8.239 (2.386 similar to 28.455), respectively. Conclusions: The methylation of p16 and FHIT genes was an independent risk factor for hepatocellular carcinoma.",10.12659/MSM.912315,"Bai, Y; Shen, YZ; Yuan, Q; Lv, CY; Xing, QZ"
61,A Framework for Optimizing High-Content Imaging of 3D Models for Drug Discovery,"Three-dimensional (3D) spheroid models are rapidly gaining favor for drug discovery applications due to their improved morphological characteristics, cellular complexity, long lifespan in culture, and higher physiological relevance relative to two-dimensional (2D) cell culture models. High-content imaging (HCI) of 3D spheroid models has the potential to provide valuable information to help researchers untangle disease pathophysiology and assess novel therapies more effectively. The transition from 2D monolayer models to dense 3D spheroids in HCI applications is not trivial, however, and requires 3D-optimized protocols, instrumentation, and resources. Here, we discuss considerations for moving from 2D to 3D models and present a framework for HCI and analysis of 3D spheroid models in a drug discovery setting. We combined scaffold-free, multicellular spheroid models with scalable, automation-compatible plate technology enabling image-based applications ranging from high-throughput screening to more complex, lower-throughput microphysiological systems of organ networks. We used this framework in three case studies: investigation of lipid droplet accumulation in a human liver nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) model, real-time immune cell interactions in a multicellular 3D lung cancer model, and a high-throughput screening application using a 3D co-culture model of gastric carcinoma to assess dose-dependent drug efficacy and specificity. The results of these proof-of-concept studies demonstrate the potential for high-resolution image-based analysis of 3D spheroid models for drug discovery applications, and confirm that cell-level and temporal-spatial analyses that fully exploit multicellular features of spheroid models are not only possible but soon will be routine practice in drug discovery workflows.",10.1177/2472555220929291,"Wardwell-Swanson, J; Suzuki, M; Dowell, KG; Bieri, M; Thoma, EC; Agarkova, I; Chiovaro, F; Strebel, S; Buschmann, N; Greve, F; Frey, O"
62,Increased risk of colorectal malignant neoplasm in patients with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease: a large study,"Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) has been suggested to be a strong risk factor of colorectal benign adenomas and advanced neoplasms. The aim of this large cohort study was to further investigate the prevalence of colorectal malignant neoplasm (CRMN) in patients with NAFLD and determine whether association between NAFLD and CRMN exists. 2,315 community subjects (1,370 males and 945 females) who underwent a routine colonoscopy according to international colorectal cancer screening guideline were recruited. Nature of colorectal lesions determined by biopsy and NAFLD was diagnosed by ultrasound. Binary logistic regression analysis was applied to explore the related associations. Prevalence of CRMN was 29.3 % (77/263) in patients with NAFLD, which was significantly higher than 18.0 % (369/2,052) in the control group (P < 0.05). In addition, malignant neoplasm in NAFLD group occurred more frequently at sigmoid colon than in control group (14.3 vs. 11.9 %). The incidence of highly-differentiated colorectal adenocarcinoma in NAFLD group was significantly higher than control group (62.3 vs. 9.8 %). Univariate analysis showed that NAFLD had strong association with CRMN (OR 2.043; 95 % CI 1.512-2.761; P < 0.05). After adjusting for metabolic and other confounding factors, NAFLD remained as an independent risk factor for CRMN (OR 1.868; 95 % CI 1.360-2.567; P < 0.05). NAFLD was an independent risk factor for CRMN. Sigmoid carcinoma and highly differentiated colorectal adenocarcinoma were more commonly found in NAFLD.

63,The study protocol for the China Health Big Data (China Biobank) project,"Background: Osteoporosis, obesity, and fatty liver are increasingly common chronic diseases that seriously threaten people's health. Low-dose chest computed tomography (LDCT) scan is frequently used for lung cancer screening in health screenings and checkups. Quantitative computed tomography (QCT) enables the accurate measurement of volumetric bone mineral density (vBMD), liver fat content, and abdominal fat area using the existing LDCT data without extra radiation. We initiated a new project, the China Health Big Data (China Biobank), which combines the LDCT scan images from lung cancer screening of participants in health checkup with QCT to investigate the added value of QCT to LDCT, in order to establish the normative reference database and diagnosis criteria for the three aforementioned conditions. Methods: The China Biobank project is a prospective nationwide multicenter cohort study that will combine QCT technology with LDCT scans to measure bone mineral density (BMD), intra-abdominal fat distribution, and liver fat content of the generally healthy checkup participants. Mindways QCT calibration phantom (Mindways Software Inc., Austin, TX, USA) and analysis software QCT PRO v6.0 will be used for all centers. Before data collection begins, the European Spine Phantom (ESP) will be used for quality control analysis at each collaborating center. The inclusion criteria are a healthy checkup participant aged 30-90 years, with LDCT as a part of his/her health checkup protocol. Exclusion criteria are pregnant women or participants with a metal implant in the CT scan area. The LDCT images will be transferred to the Mindways workstation for analysis, and vBMD in the L1 and L2 vertebrae, visceral adipose tissue (VAT), subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT), and liver fat content will be measured. As part of the health checkup, the demographic, anthropometric parameters, blood pressure, and a routine blood laboratory test will be collected. The estimated sample size will be about 30,000. Results: The combination of QCT with LDCT of the chest is validated in this project. The vBMD of spine, visceral fat and liver fat can be measured with a LDCT chest scan. Conclusions: The China Biobank project will assess the added value of QCT to LDCT, and enable accurate evaluation of the prevalence of osteoporosis, obesity, and fatty liver disease in a very large Chinese cohort.",10.21037/qims.2019.06.16,"Wu, Y; Guo, Z; Fu, XX; Wu, J; Gao, JB; Zeng, Q; Fu, HH; Cheng, XG; Ma, YZ; Zhao, KP"
64,The advent of RNA-based therapeutics for metabolic syndrome and associated conditions: a comprehensive review of the literature,"Metabolic syndrome (MetS) is a prevalent and intricate health condition affecting a significant global population, characterized by a cluster of metabolic and hormonal disorders disrupting lipid and glucose metabolism pathways. Clinical manifestations encompass obesity, dyslipidemia, insulin resistance, and hypertension, contributing to heightened risks of diabetes and cardiovascular diseases. Existing medications often fall short in addressing the syndrome's multifaceted nature, leading to suboptimal treatment outcomes and potential long-term health risks. This scenario underscores the pressing need for innovative therapeutic approaches in MetS management. RNA-based treatments, employing small interfering RNAs (siRNAs), microRNAs (miRNAs), and antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs), emerge as promising strategies to target underlying biological abnormalities. However, a summary of research available on the role of RNA-based therapeutics in MetS and related co-morbidities is limited. Murine models and human studies have been separately interrogated to determine whether there have been recent advancements in RNA-based therapeutics to offer a comprehensive understanding of treatment available for MetS. In a narrative fashion, we searched for relevant articles pertaining to MetS co-morbidities such as cardiovascular disease, fatty liver disease, dementia, colorectal cancer, and endocrine abnormalities. We emphasize the urgency of exploring novel therapeutic avenues to address the intricate pathophysiology of MetS and underscore the potential of RNA-based treatments, coupled with advanced delivery systems, as a transformative approach for achieving more comprehensive and efficacious outcomes in MetS patients.Graphical abstractIncorporating the basis of RNA therapeutics in metabolic syndrome.

65,Lipid Metabolism Alterations in a Rat Model of Chronic and Intergenerational Exposure to Arsenic,"Chronic exposure to arsenic (As), whether directly through the consumption of contaminated drinking water or indirectly through the daily intake of As-contaminated food, is a health threat for more than 150 million people worldwide. Epidemiological studies found an association between chronic consumption of As and several pathologies, the most common being cancer-related disorders. However, As consumption has also been associated with metabolic disorders that could lead to diverse pathologies, such as type 2 diabetes mellitus, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, and obesity. Here, we used ultra-performance liquid chromatography (UPLC) coupled to electrospray ionization/quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (ESI-QToF) to assess the effect of chronic intergenerational As exposure on the lipid metabolism profiles of serum from 4-month-old Wistar rats exposed to As prenatally and also during early life in drinking water (3 ppm). Significant differences in the levels of certain identified lysophospholipids, phosphatidylcholines, and triglycerides were found between the exposed rats and the control groups, as well as between the sexes. Significantly increased lipid oxidation determined by the malondialdehyde (MDA) method was found in exposed rats compared with controls. Chronic intergenerational As exposure alters the rat lipidome, increases lipid oxidation, and dysregulates metabolic pathways, the factors associated with the chronic inflammation present in different diseases associated with chronic exposure to As (i.e., keratosis, Bowen's disease, and kidney, liver, bladder, and lung cancer).",10.1155/2019/4978018,"Rivas-Santiago, C; González-Curiel, I; Zarazua, S; Murgu, M; Cardona, AR; Lazalde, B; Lara-Ramírez, EE; Vázquez, E; Castañeda-Delgado, JE; Rivas-Santiago, B; Lopez, JA; Cervantes-Villagrana, AR; López-Hernández, Y"
66,No association of NAFLD-related polymorphisms in PNPLA3 and TM6SF2 with all-cause and cardiovascular mortality in an Austrian population study,"Background and aimsSingle-nucleotide-polymorphisms in PNPLA3-rs738409 and the TM6SF2-rs58542926, associated with metabolic-dysfunction-associated fatty liver disease (MAFLD), have been discussed as potentially protective for cardiovascular diseases. Therefore, we aimed to study the associations of PNPLA3/TM6SF2 variants with MAFLD and cardiovascular risk in a population-based sample of asymptomatic patients.MethodsThe study cohort comprised 1742 patients of European decent aged 45-80 years from a registry study undergoing screening colonoscopy for colorectal cancer between 2010 and 2014. SCORE2 and Framingham risk score calculated to assess cardiovascular risk. Data on survival were obtained from the national death registryResultsHalf of included patients were male (52%, 59 +/- 10 years), 819 (47%) carried PNPLA3-G and 278 (16%) TM6SF2-T-alleles. MAFLD (PNPLA3-G-allele: 46% vs. 41%, p = 0.041; TM6SF2-T-allele: 54% vs. 42%, p < 0.001) was more frequent in patients harbouring risk alleles with both showing independent associations with MAFLD on multivariable binary logistic regression analysis. While median Framingham risk score was lower in PNPLA3-G-allele carriers (10 vs. 8, p = 0.011), SCORE2 and established cardiovascular diseases were similar across carriers vs. non-carriers of the respective risk-alleles. During a median follow-up of 9.1 years, neither PNPLA3-G-allele nor TM6SF2-T-allele was associated with overall nor with cardiovascular mortality.ConclusionCarriage of PNPLA3/TM6SF2 risk alleles could not be identified as significant factor for all-cause or cardiovascular mortality in asymptomatic middle-aged individuals undergoing screening colonoscopy.",10.1007/s00508-023-02196-2,"Semmler, G; Balcar, L; Wernly, S; Datz, L; Semmler, M; Rosenstatter, L; Stickel, F; Aigner, E; Wernly, B; Datz, C"
67,"Steatosis, Steatohepatitis and Cancer Immunotherapy: An Intricate Story","Immune checkpoint inhibitors represent one of the most significant recent advances in clinical oncology, since they dramatically improved the prognosis of deadly cancers such as melanomas and lung cancer. Treatment with these drugs may be complicated by the occurrence of clinically-relevant adverse drug reactions, most of which are immune-mediated, such as pneumonitis, colitis, endocrinopathies, nephritis, Stevens Johnson syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis. Drug-induced steatosis and steatohepatitis are not included among the typical forms of cancer immunotherapy-induced liver toxicity, which, instead, usually occurs as a panlobular hepatitis with prominent lymphocytic infiltrates. Nonetheless, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease is a risk factor for immunotherapy-induced hepatitis, and steatosis and steatohepatitis are frequently observed in this condition. In the present review we discuss how these pathology findings could be explained in the context of current models suggesting immune-mediated pathogenesis for steatohepatitis. We also review evidence suggesting that in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma, the presence of steatosis or steatohepatitis could predict a poor therapeutic response to these agents. How these findings could fit with immune-mediated mechanisms of these liver diseases will also be discussed.",10.3390/ijms222312947,"Cataldi, M; Manco, F; Tarantino, G"
68,Oral and Gut Microbial Dysbiosis and Non-alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease: The Central Role of <i>Porphyromonas gingivalis</i>,"Gut microbiota play many important roles, such as the regulation of immunity and barrier function in the intestine, and are crucial for maintaining homeostasis in living organisms. The disruption in microbiota is called dysbiosis, which has been associated with various chronic inflammatory conditions, food allergies, colorectal cancer, etc. The gut microbiota is also affected by several other factors such as diet, antibiotics and other medications, or bacterial and viral infections. Moreover, there are some reports on the oral-gut-liver axis indicating that the disruption of oral microbiota affects the intestinal biota. Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is one of the systemic diseases caused due to the dysregulation of the oral-gut-liver axis. NAFLD is the most common liver disease reported in the developed countries. It includes liver damage ranging from simple steatosis to nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), cirrhosis, and cancer. Recently, accumulating evidence supports an association between NAFLD and dysbiosis of oral and gut microbiota. Periodontopathic bacteria, especially Porphyromonas gingivalis, have been correlated with the pathogenesis and development of NAFLD based on the clinical and basic research, and immunology. P. gingivalis was detected in the liver, and lipopolysaccharide from this bacteria has been shown to be involved in the progression of NAFLD, thereby indicating a direct role of P. gingivalis in NAFLD. Moreover, P. gingivalis induces dysbiosis of gut microbiota, which promotes the progression of NAFLD, through disrupting both metabolic and immunologic pathways. Here, we review the roles of microbial dysbiosis in NAFLD. Focusing on P. gingivalis, we evaluate and summarize the most recent advances in our understanding of the relationship between oral-gut microbiome symbiosis and the pathogenesis and progression of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, as well as discuss novel strategies targeting both P. gingivalis and microbial dysbiosis.",10.3389/fmed.2022.822190,"Wang, T; Ishikawa, T; Sasaki, M; Chiba, T"
69,Enhanced acetylation of ATP-citrate lyase promotes the progression of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease,"Hepatic steatosis is a hallmark of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and is promoted by dysregulated de novo lipogenesis. ATP-citrate lyase (ACLY) is a crucial lipogenic enzyme that is up-regulated in individuals with NAFLD. A previous study has shown that acetylation of ACLY at Lys-540, Lys-546, and Lys-554 (ACLY-3K) increases ACLY protein stability by antagonizing its ubiquitylation, thereby promoting lipid synthesis and cell proliferation in lung cancer cells. But the functional importance of this regulatory mechanism in other cellular or tissue contexts or under other pathophysiological conditions awaits further investigation. Here, we show that ACLY-3K acetylation also promotes ACLY protein stability in AML12 cells, a mouse hepatocyte cell line, and found that the deacetylase sirtuin 2 (SIRT2) deacetylates ACLY-3K and destabilizes ACLY in these cells. Of note, the livers of mice and humans with NAFLD had increased ACLY protein and ACLY-3K acetylation levels and decreased SIRT2 protein levels. Mimicking ACLY-3K acetylation by replacing the three lysines with three glutamines (ACLY-3KQ variant) promoted lipid accumulation both in high glucose-treated AML12 cells and in the livers of high-fat/high-sucrose (HF/HS) diet-fed mice. Moreover, overexpressing SIRT2 in AML12 cells inhibited lipid accumulation, which was more efficiently reversed by overexpressing the ACLY-3KQ variant than by overexpressing WT ACLY. Additionally, hepatic SIRT2 overexpression decreased ACLY-3K acetylation and its protein level and alleviated hepatic steatosis in HF/HS diet-fed mice. Our findings reveal a posttranscriptional mechanism underlying the up-regulation of hepatic ACLY in NAFLD and suggest that the SIRT2/ACLY axis is involved in NAFLD progression.",10.1074/jbc.RA119.008708,"Guo, L; Guo, YY; Li, BY; Peng, WQ; Chang, XX; Gao, X; Tang, QQ"
70,The Exploration of Novel Pharmacophore Characteristics and Multidirectional Elucidation of Structure-Activity Relationship and Mechanism of Sesquiterpene Pyridine Alkaloids from <i>Tripterygium</i> Based on Computational Approaches,"Sesquiterpene pyridine alkaloids are a large group of highly oxygenated sesquiterpenoids, which are characterized by a macrocyclic dilactone skeleton containing 2-(carboxyalkyl) nicotinic acid and dihydro-beta-agarofuran sesquiterpenoid, and are believed to be the active and less toxic components of Tripterygium. In this study, 55 sesquiterpene pyridine alkaloids from Tripterygium were subjected to identification of pharmacophore characteristics and potential targets analysis. Our results revealed that the greatest structural difference of these compounds was in the pyridine ring and the pharmacophore model-5 (Pm-05) was the best model that consisted of three features including hydrogen bond acceptor (HBA), hydrogen bond donor (HBD), and hydrophobic (HY), especially hydrophobic group located in the pyridine ring. It was proposed that 2-(carboxyalkyl) nicotinic acid part possessing a pyridine ring system was not only a pharmacologically active center but also a core of structural diversity of alkaloids from Tripterygium wilfordii. Furthermore, sesquiterpene pyridine alkaloids from Tripterygium were predicted to target multiple proteins and pathways and possibly played essential roles in the cure of Alzheimer's disease, breast cancer, Chagas disease, and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). They also had other pharmacological effects, depending on the binding interactions between pyridine rings of these compounds and active cavities of the target genes platelet-activating factor receptor (PTAFR), cannabinoid receptor 1 (CNR1), cannabinoid receptor 1 (CNR2), squalene synthase (FDFT1), and heat shock protein HSP 90-alpha (HSP90AA1). Taken together, the results of this present study indicated that sesquiterpene pyridine alkaloids from Tripterygium are promising candidates that exhibit potential for development as medicine sources and need to be promoted.",10.1155/2021/6676470,"Long, CY; Yang, Y; Yang, Y; Huang, SX; Zhang, XM; Du, W; Yang, DJ; Guo, YL; Zhang, L"

It remains unclear how the long-term use of novel lipid-lowering drugs affects the occurrence of cancers and age-related diseases.Methods: A drug-target Mendelian randomization study was performed. Genetic variants of nine lipid-lowering drug-target genes (HMGCR, PCKS9, NPC1L1, LDLR, APOB, CETP, LPL, APOC3, and ANGPTL3) were extracted as exposures from the summary data of Global Lipids Genetics Consortium Genome-Wide Association Studies (GWAS). GWAS summary data of cancers and noncancerous diseases were used as outcomes. The inversevariance weighted method was applied as the main statistical approach. Sensitivity tests were conducted to evaluate the robustness, pleiotropy, and heterogeneity of the results.Results: In addition to marked effects on decreased risks of atherosclerotic cardiovascular diseases, genetically proxied lipid-lowering variants of PCKS9, CETP, LPL, LDLR, and APOC3 were associated with longer human lifespans (q<0.05). Lipid-lowering variants of ANGPTL3 and LDLR were associated with reduced risks of colorectal cancer, and ANGPTL3 was also associated with lower risks of gastric cancer (q<0.05). Lipid-lowering LPL variants were associated with decreased risks of hypertension, type 2 diabetes, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, and bladder cancer (q<0.05). Lipid-lowering variants of PCKS9 and HMGCR were associated with decreased risks of osteoporosis (q<0.05). Lipid-lowering APOB variants were associated with a decreased risk of thyroid cancer (q<0.05).Conclusions: Our study provides genetic evidence that newer nonstatin lipid-lowering agents have causal effects on decreased risks of several common cancers and cardiometabolic diseases. These data provide genetic insights into the potential benefits of newer nonstatin therapies.",,"Chen, H; Tang, XY; Su, W; Li, S; Yang, RY; Cheng, H; Zhang, GX; Zhou, XY"
72,Role of the Ghrelin System in Colitis and Hepatitis as Risk Factors for Inflammatory-Related Cancers,"It is not known exactly what leads to the development of colorectal cancer (CRC) and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), but there are specific risk factors that increase the probability of their occurrence. The unclear pathogenesis, too-late diagnosis, poor prognosis as a result of high recurrence and metastasis rates, and repeatedly ineffective therapy of both cancers continue to challenge both basic science and practical medicine. The ghrelin system, which is comprised of ghrelin and alternative peptides (e.g., obestatin), growth hormone secretagogue receptors (GHS-Rs), and ghrelin-O-acyl-transferase (GOAT), plays an important role in the physiology and pathology of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract. It promotes various physiological effects, including energy metabolism and amelioration of inflammation. The ghrelin system plays a role in the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs), which are well known risk factors for the development of CRC, as well as inflammatory liver diseases which can trigger the development of HCC. Colitis-associated cancer serves as a prototype of inflammation-associated cancers. Little is known about the role of the ghrelin system in the mechanisms of transformation of chronic inflammation to low- and high-grade dysplasia, and, finally, to CRC. HCC is also associated with chronic inflammation and fibrosis arising from different etiologies, including alcoholic and nonalcoholic fatty liver diseases (NAFLD), and/or hepatitis B (HBV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV) infections. However, the exact role of ghrelin in the progression of the chronic inflammatory lesions into HCC is still unknown. The aim of this review is to summarize findings on the role of the ghrelin system in inflammatory bowel and liver diseases in order to better understand the impact of this system on the development of inflammatory-related cancers, namely CRC and HCC.",10.3390/ijms231911188,"Kasprzak, A; Adamek, A"
73,"Overview of Ursolic Acid Potential for the Treatment of Metabolic Disorders, Autoimmune Diseases, and Cancers via Nuclear Receptor Pathways","Nuclear receptors (NRs) form a family of druggable transcription factors that are regulated by ligand binding to orchestrate multifaceted physiological functions, including reproduction, immunity, metabolism, and growth. NRs represent attractive and valid targets for the management and treatment of a vast array of ailments. Pentacyclic triterpenes (PTs) are ubiquitously distributed natural products in medicinal and aromatic plants, of which ursolic acid (UA) is an extensively studied member, due to its diverse bio-pertinent activities against different cancers, inflammation, aging, obesity, diabetes, dyslipidemia, and liver injury. In fact, PTs share a common lipophilic structure that resembles NRs' endogenous ligands. Herein, we present a review of the literature on UA's effect on NRs, showcasing the resulting health benefits and potential therapeutic outcomes. De facto, UA exhibited numerous pharmacodynamic effects on PPAR, LXR, FXR, and PXR, resulting in remarkable anti-inflammatory, anti-hyperlipidemic, and hepatoprotective properties, by lowering lipid accumulation in hepatocytes and mitigating non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) and its subsequent liver fibrosis. Furthermore, UA reversed valproate and rifampicin-induced hepatic lipid accumulation. Additionally, UA showed great promise for the treatment of autoimmune inflammatory diseases such as multiple sclerosis and autoimmune arthritis by antagonizing ROR gamma. UA exhibited antiproliferative effects against skin, prostate, and breast cancers, partially via PPAR alpha and ROR gamma pathways.

Patients and Methods: We retrospectively analyzed 57,119 individuals who underwent health checkups at the People's Hospital of Guangxi from May 2020 to May 2024. Patients with fatty liver were divided into pulmonary nodule and no pulmonary nodule groups. Univariate and multifactorial analyses were conducted using physical examination data, laboratory test indexes, and imaging information. Logistic regression analysis was used to identify independent predictors of pulmonary nodules in fatty liver patients. Results: A total of 20,042 patients with fatty liver were included in the study, with 12,334 (61.5%) in the lung nodule group and 7708 (38.5%) in the non-lung nodule group. Age, gender, systolic and diastolic blood pressure were significantly higher in the pulmonary nodule group, while body weight, waist circumference, hemoglobin, uric acid, and glutamyltransferase were lower. Multifactorial logistic regression analysis showed that male gender, body weight, age, and diastolic blood pressure were significant factors influencing lung nodule development in fatty liver patients.

75,Modulation of the intestinal Microbiota by Nutritional Interventions,"Humans live in symbiosis with billions of commensal bacteria. The so-called microbiota live on different biological interfaces such as the skin, the urogenital tract and the gastrointestinal tract. Commensal bacteria replace potentially pathogenic microbes, synthesize vitamins and ferment dietary fibre. An imbalance in the bacterial composition of the intestinal microbiota has been associated with various diseases including gut-associated disorders such as inflammatory bowel diseases, colorectal cancer and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease. Furthermore, a shift in the microbiota composition appears to be of pathophysiological relevance which renders the specific modulation of the intestinal microbiota a promising approach in the treatment of the above mentioned diseases. Our intestinal microbiota composition is mainly modulated by dietary macro- and micronutrients but also by secondary plant compounds and synthetic food additives such as emulsifiers and artificial sweeteners. Nutritional interventions with the purpose to modulate the intestinal microbiota show only limited therapeutic potential in the treatment of gut-associated disorders, which may be due to individual differences in the intestinal microbiota composition and a lack of specificity. A combination of newly established technical analytic approaches involving a machine-learning algorithm may bridge the currently existing limitations by providing a personalized, highly-specific and consequently therapeutically effective microbiota modulation.",10.1007/s00108-017-0217-0,"Derer, S; Lehnert, H; Sina, C; Wagner, AE"
76,Discrete Correlation Summation Clustering Reveals Differential Regulation of Liver Metabolism by Thrombospondin-1 in Low-Fat and High-Fat Diet-Fed Mice,"Thrombospondin-1 (TSP1) is a matricellular protein with many important roles in mediating carcinogenesis, fibrosis, leukocyte recruitment, and metabolism. We have previously shown a role of diet in the absence of TSP1 in liver metabolism in the context of a colorectal cancer model. However, the metabolic implications of TSP1 regulation by diet in the liver metabolism are currently understudied. Therefore Discrete correlation summation (DCS) was used to re-interrogate data and determine the metabolic alterations of TSP1 deficiency in the liver, providing new insights into the role of TSP1 in liver injury and the progression of liver pathologies such as nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). DCS analysis provides a straightforward approach to rank covariance and data clustering when analyzing complex data sets. Using this approach, our previous liver metabolite data was re-analyzed by comparing wild-type (WT) and Thrombospondin-1 null (Thbs1(-/-)) mice, identifying changes driven by genotype and diet. Principal component analysis showed clustering of animals by genotype regardless of diet, indicating that TSP1 deficiency alters metabolite handling in the liver. High-fat diet consumption significantly altered over 150 metabolites in the Thbs1(-/-) livers versus approximately 90 in the wild-type livers, most involved in amino acid metabolism.

77,Impact of diet on irinotecan toxicity in mice,"Irinotecan is highly effective in the treatment of metastatic colorectal cancer as well as many other cancers. However, irinotecan is known to cause severe diarrhea, which pose significant problems in patients undergoing irinotecan based chemotherapy. Dietary and herbal components have shown promise in improving gastrointestinal health. Therefore, we compared the effect of grain-based chow diet containing phytoestrogens and corn/alfalfa as fat source to purified diets containing either animal-derived fat source (lard) or plant-derived fat source (soybean oil) on irinotecan-induced toxicities in mice. The concentration of the toxic metabolite, SN-38, was measured in the serum, and the activity of main enzyme, carboxylesterase (CEs) involved in biotransformation of irinotecan to SN-38 formation was measured in the liver. We found that the grain-based diet was protective against irinotecan-induced diarrhea. Interestingly, purified diet containing lard caused fatty liver in mice, while grain-based chow diet containing corn/alfa-alfa or purified diet with soybean oil did not cause fat deposition in the liver. Serum SN-38 concentration was significantly higher in the mice fed with purified diets compared to the chow-fed mice. Hepatic CEs activity was induced in the presence of irinotecan in mice on purified diets, but not chow diet. These results indicate that components of grain-based natural diet (presumably phytoestrogens and/or the macronutrients balance) compared to purified diets may have a beneficial effect by controlling the adverse effects of irinotecan in cancer patients.",10.1016/j.cbi.2018.06.018,"Mallick, P; Shah, P; Ittmann, MM; Trivedi, M; Hu, M; Gao, S; Ghose, R"
78,The impact of endotrophin on the progression of chronic liver disease,"Liver disease: Collagen fragment spurs liver inflammation and fibrosis Localized buildup in the liver of a collagen-derived cleavage fragment plays a critical role in accelerating the development of tissue scarring and liver cancer in mice. Using a transgenic mouse model of fatty liver disease, a team led by Philipp Scherer from the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, USA, and Jiyoung Park of Ulsan National Institute of Science and Technology, South Korea, showed that liver-specific accumulation of a collagen fragment known as endotrophin leads to activation of inflammatory and fibrotic pathways. The mice subsequently develop metabolic dysfunction, insulin resistance and, with time, cancerous nodules in the liver. The findings suggest that endotrophin accumulation, when it occurs in liver tissue that already contains large depositions of fat, can overwhelm normal liver physiology and accelerate organ damage. Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is the most common liver disease and can lead to multiple complications, including non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), cirrhosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma. The fibrotic liver is characterized by the pathological accumulation of extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins. Type VI collagen alpha3 (Col6a3) is a biomarker of hepatic fibrosis, and its cleaved form, endotrophin (ETP), plays a critical role in adipose tissue dysfunction, insulin resistance, and breast cancer development. Here, we studied the effects of the Col6a3-derived peptide ETP on the progression of chronic liver diseases, such as NASH and liver cancer. We used a doxycycline (Dox)-inducible liver-specific ETP-overexpressing mouse model on a NAFLD-prone (liver-specific SREBP1a transgenic) background. For this, we evaluated the consequences of local ETP expression in the liver and its effect on hepatic inflammation, fibrosis, and insulin resistance. Accumulation of ETP in the liver induced hepatic inflammation and the development of fibrosis with associated insulin resistance. Surprisingly, ETP overexpression also led to the emergence of liver cancer within 10 months in the SREBP1a transgenic background. Our data revealed that ETP can act as a ""second hit"" during the progression of NAFLD and can play an important role in the development of NASH and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). These observations firmly link elevated levels of ETP to chronic liver disease.",10.1038/s12276-020-00520-8,"Kim, M; Lee, C; Seo, DY; Lee, H; Horton, JD; Park, J; Scherer, PE"
79,Preoperative detection of colorectal liver metastases in fatty liver: MDCT or MRI?,"Objective: To compare the diagnostic value of multidetector computed tomography (MDCT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in the preoperative detection of colorectal liver metastases in diffuse fatty infiltration of the liver, associated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Materials and methods: Twenty preoperative tri-phasic MDCT(4-64-row, Siemens) and dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI (1.5 T or 3.0 T, Siemens) examinations of patients with colorectal cancer and liver metastases in diffuse steatosis were retrospectively evaluated. All patients underwent surgical resection for liver metastases (time interval 1-60 days). The amount of fatty infiltration of the liver was determined histopathologically by semi-quantitative percent-wise estimation and ranged from 25 to 75%. Results: Overall, 51 metastases were found by histopathology of the resected liver segments/lobes. The size of the metastases ranged from 0.4 to 13 cm, with 18 (35%) being up to 1 cm in diameter. In the overall rating, MDCT detected 33/51 lesions (65%), and MRI 45/51 (88%). For lesions up to 1 cm, MDCT detected only 2/18 (11%) and MRI 12/18 (66%). One false positive lesion was detected by MDCT. Statistical analysis showed that MRI is markedly superior to MDCT, with a statistically significant difference (p < .001), particularly for the detection of small lesions (<= 1 cm; p < .004). There was no significant difference between the two modalities in the detection of lesions >1 cm. Conclusion: For the detection of colorectal liver metastases after neoadjuvant chemotherapy and consecutive diffuse fatty infiltration of the liver, MRI is superior to MDCT, especially for the detection of small lesions.

80,Obesity as a risk factor for diseases of the digestive system,"Currently, the global prevalence of obesity among the world's adult population is about 650 million people, which makes it possible to consider this chronic metabolic disease as a non-infectious pandemic of the 21st century. It has been proven that obesity is associated with several gastroenterological diseases, while the mechanisms of these associations are extremely heterogeneous and multifactorial. Hypertrophy and hyperplasia of adipocytes in obesity lead to a change in the profile of adipokine production (a decrease in adiponectin, an increase in leptin), an increase in the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines (interleukin-1, 6, 8, tumor necrosis factor a), C-reactive protein, free fatty acids, as well as active forms of oxygen (superoxide radicals, H2O2). All the above induces the development of chronic slowly progressive inflammation, oxidative stress, and insulin resistance. In addition, peptides secreted by adipocytes (adiponectin, leptin, nesfatin-1 and apelin) can modulate gastrointestinal motility, acting both centrally and peripherally. The qualitative and quantitative changes in the intestinal microbiota observed in obese patients (increased Firmicutes and decreased Bacteroidetes) lead to a decrease in the production of short-chain fatty acids and an increase in the intestinal permeability due to disruption of intercellular tight junctions, which leads to increased translocation of bacteria and endotoxins into the systemic circulation. Numerous studies have demonstrated the association of obesity with diseases of the esophagus (gastroesophageal reflux disease, Barrett's esophagus, esophageal adenocarcinoma, esophageal motility disorders), stomach (functional dyspepsia, stomach cancer), gallbladder (cholelithiasis, gallbladder cancer), pancreas (acute pancreatitis, pancreatic cancer), liver (non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, hepatocellular carcinoma), intestine (diverticular disease, irritable bowel syndrome, colorectal cancer).",10.26442/00403660.2021.08.200983,"Andreev, DN; Kucheryavyy, YA"
81,Role of nuclear receptor SHP in metabolism and cancer,"Small heterodimer partner (SHP, NR0B2) is a unique member of the nuclear receptor (NR) superfamily that contains the dimerization and ligand-binding domain found in other family members, but lacks the conserved DNA-binding domain. The ability of SHP to bind directly to multiple NRs is crucial for its physiological function as a transcriptional inhibitor of gene expression. A wide variety of interacting partners for SHP have been identified, indicating the potential for SHP to regulate an array of genes in different biological pathways. In this review, we summarize studies concerning the structure and target genes of SHP and discuss recent progress in understanding the function of SHP in bile acid, cholesterol, triglyceride, glucose, and drug metabolism. In addition, we review the regulatory role of SHP in microRNA (miRNA) regulation, liver fibrosis and cancer progression. The fact that SHP controls a complex set of genes in multiple metabolic pathways suggests the intriguing possibility of developing new therapeutics for metabolic diseases, including fatty liver, dyslipidemia and obesity, by regulating SHP with small molecules. To achieve this goal, more progress regarding SHP ligands and protein structure will be required. Besides its metabolic regulatory function, studies by us and other groups provide strong evidence that SHP plays a critical role in the development of cancer, particularly liver and breast cancer. An increased understanding of the fundamental mechanisms by which SHP regulates the development of cancers will be critical in applying knowledge of SHP in diagnostic, therapeutic or preventive strategies for specific cancers.

82,TCF7L2 transcriptionally regulates <i>Fgf15</i> to maintain bile acid and lipid homeostasis through gut-liver crosstalk,"FGF19/FGF15 is an endocrine regulator of hepatic bile salt and lipid metabolism, which has shown promising effects in the treatment of NASH in clinical trials. FGF19/15 is transcribed and released from enterocytes of the small intestine into enterohepatic circulation in response to bile-induced FXR activation. Previously, the TSS of FGF19 was identified to bind Wnt-regulated TCF7L2/encoded transcription factor TCF4 in colorectal cancer cells. Impaired Wnt signaling and specifical loss of function of its coreceptor LRP6 have been associated with NASH. We, therefore, examined if TCF7L2/TCF4 upregulates Fgf19 in the small intestine and restrains NASH through gut-liver crosstalk. We examined the mice globally overexpressing, haploinsufficient, and conditional knockout models of TCF7L2 in the intestinal epithelium. The TCF7L2(+/-) mice exhibited increased plasma bile salts and lipids and developed diet-induced fatty liver disease while mice globally overexpressing TCF7L2 were protected against these traits. Comprehensive in vivo analysis revealed that TCF7L2 transcriptionally upregulates FGF15 in the gut, leading to reduced bile synthesis and diminished intestinal lipid uptake. Accordingly, Vilin(Creert2); Tcf7L2(fl/fl) mice showed reduced Fgf19 in the ileum, and increased plasma bile. The global overexpression of TCF7L2 in mice with metabolic syndrome-linked LRP6(R611C) substitution rescued the fatty liver and fibrosis in the latter. Strikingly, the hepatic levels of TCF4 were reduced and CYP7a1 was increased in human NASH, indicating the relevance of TCF4-dependent regulation of bile synthesis to human disease. These studies identify the critical role of TCF4 as an upstream regulator of the FGF15-mediated gut-liver crosstalk that maintains bile and liver triglyceride homeostasis.",10.1096/fj.202101607R,"Bhat, N; Esteghamat, F; Chaube, BK; Gunawardhana, K; Mani, M; Thames, C; Jain, D; Ginsberg, HN; Fernandes-Hernando, C; Mani, A"

A total of 34 patients with colo-rectal adenocarcinoma underwent preoperatively CE-US, MDCT, Gd- and SPIO-enhanced MR imaging (MRI), and PET/CT. Each set of images was reviewed independently by two blinded observers. The ROC method was used to analyze the results, which were correlated with surgical findings, intraoperative US, histopathology, and MDCT follow-up. A total of 57 hepatic lesions were identified: 11 hemangiomas, 29 cysts, 1 focal fatty liver, 16 metastases (dimensional distribution: 5/16 < 5 mm; 3/16 between 5 mm and < 10 mm; 8/16 a parts per thousand yen 10 mm). Six of 34 patients were classified as positive for the presence of at least one metastasis. Considering all the metastases and those a parts per thousand yen10 mm, ROC areas showed no significant differences between Gd- and SPIO-enhanced MRI, which performed significantly better than the other modalities (P < 0.05). Considering the lesions < 10 mm, ROC areas showed no significant differences between all modalities; however MRI presented a trend to perform better than the other techniques. Considering the patients, ROC areas showed no significant differences between all the modalities; however PET/CT seemed to perform better than the others.

84,The interplay between probiotics and host autophagy: mechanisms of action and emerging insights,"Autophagy, a lysosome-dependent protein degradation mechanism, is a highly conserved catabolic process seen in all eukaryotes. This cell protection system, which is present in all tissues and functions at a basic level, can be up- or downregulated in response to various stresses. A disruption in the natural route of the autophagy process is frequently followed by an interruption in the inherent operation of the body's cells and organs. Probiotics are live bacteria that protect the host through various mechanisms. One of the processes through which probiotics exert their beneficial effects on various cells and tissues is autophagy. Autophagy can assist in maintaining host homeostasis by stimulating the immune system and affecting numerous physiological and pathological responses.

85,"VDAC1-Based Peptides as Potential Modulators of VDAC1 Interactions with Its Partners and as a Therapeutic for Cancer, NASH, and Diabetes","This review presents current knowledge related to the voltage-dependent anion channel-1 (VDAC1) as a multi-functional mitochondrial protein that acts in regulating both cell life and death. The location of VDAC1 at the outer mitochondrial membrane (OMM) allows control of metabolic cross-talk between the mitochondria and the rest of the cell, and also enables its interaction with proteins that are involved in metabolic, cell death, and survival pathways. VDAC1 ' s interactions with over 150 proteins can mediate and regulate the integration of mitochondrial functions with cellular activities. To target these protein-protein interactions, VDAC1-derived peptides have been developed. This review focuses specifically on cell-penetrating VDAC1-based peptides that were developed and used as a ""decoy"" to compete with VDAC1 for its VDAC1-interacting proteins. These peptides interfere with VDAC1 interactions, for example, with metabolism-associated proteins such as hexokinase (HK), or with anti-apoptotic proteins such as Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL. These and other VDAC1-interacting proteins are highly expressed in many cancers. The VDAC1-based peptides in cells in culture selectively affect cancerous, but not non-cancerous cells, inducing cell death in a variety of cancers, regardless of the cancer origin or genetics. They inhibit cell energy production, eliminate cancer stem cells, and act very rapidly and at low micro-molar concentrations. The activity of these peptides has been validated in several mouse cancer models of glioblastoma, lung, and breast cancers. Their anti-cancer activity involves a multi-pronged attack targeting the hallmarks of cancer. They were also found to be effective in treating non-alcoholic fatty liver disease and diabetes mellitus. Thus, VDAC1-based peptides, by targeting VDAC1-interacting proteins, offer an affordable and innovative new conceptual therapeutic paradigm that can potentially overcome heterogeneity, chemoresistance, and invasive metastatic formation.",10.3390/biom14091139,"Shteinfer-Kuzmine, A; Santhanam, M; Shoshan-Barmatz, V"
86,In Vivo Validation of an In Situ Calibration Bead as a Reference for Backscatter Coef fi cient Calculation,"Objective: The study described here was aimed at assessing the capability of quantitative ultrasound (QUS) based on the backscatter coef ficient (BSC) for classifying disease states, such as breast cancer response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy and quanti fication of fatty liver disease. We evaluated the effectiveness of an in situ titanium (Ti) bead as a reference target in calibrating the system and mitigating attenuation and transmission loss effects on BSC estimation. Methods: Traditional BSC estimation methods require external references for calibration, which do not account for ultrasound attenuation or transmission losses through tissues. To address this issue, we used an in situ Ti bead as a reference target, because it can be used to calibrate the system and mitigate the attenuation and transmission loss effects on estimation of the BSC. The capabilities of the in situ calibration approach were assessed by quantifying consistency of BSC estimates from rabbit mammary tumors (N = 21). Speci fically, mammary tumors were grown in rabbits and when a tumor reached >= 1 cm in size, a 2 mm Ti bead was implanted in the tumor as a radiological marker and a calibration source for ultrasound. Three days later, the tumors were scanned with an L-14/5 38 array transducer connected to a SonixOne scanner with and without a slab of pork belly placed on top of the tumors. The pork belly acted as an additional source of attenuation and transmission loss. QUS parameters, specifically effective scatterer diameter (ESD) and effective acoustic concentration (EAC), were calculated using calibration spectra from both an external reference phantom and the Ti bead. Results: For ESD estimation, the 95 % con fidence interval between measurements with and without the pork belly layer was 6.0, 27.4 using the in situ bead and 114, 135.1 with the external reference phantom. For EAC estimation, the 95 % con fidence intervals were -8.1, 0.5 for the bead and -41.5, -32.2 for the phantom. These results indicate that the in situ bead method has reduced bias in QUS estimates because of intervening tissue losses. Conclusion: The use of an in situ Ti bead as a radiological marker not only serves its traditional role but also effectively acts as a calibration target for QUS methods. This approach accounts for attenuation and transmission losses in tissue, resulting in more accurate QUS estimates and offering a promising method for enhanced disease state classi fication in clinical settings.",10.1016/j.ultrasmedbio.2024.02.005,"Zhao, YN; Czarnota, GJ; Park, TH; Miller, RJ; Oelze, ML"
87,Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease is not independently associated with <i>Helicobacter pylori</i> in a central European screening cohort,"BACKGROUND: The association between Helicobacter pylori (Hp) infection and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is subject of a contentious debate. Data mainly stem from Asian cohorts whereas European data are scarce. We, therefore, investigated an Austrian colorectal cancer screening cohort for an association between Hp and NAFLD. METHODS: In total, 5338 consecutive participants undergoing screening colonoscopy at a single center in Austria were evaluated in this cross-sectional study. The primary risk factor was being Hp negative or positive. The primary endpoint was the presence of NAFLD defined by ultrasound (NAFLD; primary endpoint). Uni- and multivariable logistic regression models were fitted to obtain odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (95%CI). Finally, this association was analyzed in a subgroup of 1128 patients in whom NAFLD was diagnosed by transient elastography (TE, secondary endpoint). RESULTS: NAFLD prevalence defined by ultrasound did not differ between Hp positive (48%) and negative patients (45%, P=0.097). Accordingly, in uni- (OR 1.12 95% CI 0.98-1.29; P=0.098) and multivariable analysis adjusting for different risk factors (aOR 0.96 95%CI 0.82-1.13; P=0.601) no independent association was found. On subgroup analysis, NAFLD diagnosed by TE was more prevalent in the Hp positive compared to the Hp negative group (49% vs. 38%, P=0.004) and these patients also had higher steatosis grades. However, after adjustment for risk factors, no independent association between Hp positivity and NAFLD diagnosed by TE (aOR 1.26 95%CI 0.89-1.78; P=0.194) was confirmed. CONCLUSIONS: In this Central European cohort, Hp-positivity was not associated with the diagnosis of NAFLD. Although Hp positive patients seem to be more likely to have a concomitant NAFLD diagnosis, this association might rather relate to a cardiometabolic risk phenotype than causality.",10.23736/S0026-4806.22.07928-9,"Wernly, S; Wernly, B; Semmler, G; Völkerer, A; Rezar, R; Semmler, L; Stickel, F; Aigner, E; Niederseer, D; Datz, C"

From the database of 1512 cirrhotic patients 94 with newly diagnosed PVT based on contrast-enhanced computed tomography were referred to the Case group. Malignant PVT was an exclusion criterion. Patients without PVT were stratified and matched according to sex, age and etiology of cirrhosis; case-control ratio was 1 : 3-4. The prevalence of PVT in the database, clinical, laboratory, instrumental parameters of the groups were evaluated.

89,Multiple Machine Learning Identifies Key Gene PHLDA1 Suppressing NAFLD Progression,"Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) poses a serious global health threat, with its progression mechanisms not yet fully understood. While several molecular markers for NAFLD have been developed in recent years, a lack of robust evidence hampers their clinical application. Therefore, identifying novel and potent biomarkers would directly aid in the prediction, prevention, and personalized treatment of NAFLD. We downloaded NAFLD-related datasets from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO). Differential expression analysis and functional analysis were initially conducted. Subsequently, Weighted Gene Co-expression Network Analysis (WGCNA) and multiple machine learning strategies were employed to screen and identify key genes, and the diagnostic value was assessed using Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) analysis. We then explored the relationship between genes and immune cells using transcriptome data and single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data. Finally, we validated our findings in cell and mouse NAFLD models. We obtained 23 overlapping differentially expressed genes (DEGs) across three NAFLD datasets. Enrichment analysis revealed that DEGs were associated with Apoptosis, Parathyroid hormone synthesis, secretion and action, Colorectal cancer, p53 signaling pathway, and Biosynthesis of unsaturated fatty acids. After employing machine learning strategies, we identified one gene, pleckstrin homology like domain family A member 1 (PHLDA1), downregulated in NAFLD and showing high diagnostic accuracy. CIBERSORT analysis revealed significant associations of PHLDA1 with various immune cells. Single-cell data analysis demonstrated downregulation of PHLDA1 in NAFLD, with PHLDA1 exhibiting a significant negative correlation with macrophages. Furthermore, we found PHLDA1 to be downregulated in an in vitro hepatic steatosis cell model, and overexpression of PHLDA1 significantly reduced lipid accumulation, as well as the expression of key molecules involved in hepatic lipogenesis and fatty acid uptake, such as FASN, SCD-1, and CD36. Additionally, gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) pathway enrichment analysis suggested that PHLDA1 may influence NAFLD progression through pathways such as Cytokine Cytokine Receptor Interaction, Ecm Receptor Interaction, Parkinson's Disease, and Ribosome pathways. Our conclusions were further validated in a mouse model of NAFLD. Our study reveals that PHLDA1 inhibits the progression of NAFLD, as overexpression of PHLDA1 significantly reduces lipid accumulation in cells and markedly decreases the expression of key molecules involved in liver lipogenesis and fatty acid uptake. Therefore, PHLDA1 may emerge as a novel potential target for future prediction, diagnosis, and targeted prevention of NAFLD.",10.1007/s10753-024-02164-6,"Yang, ZW; Chen, ZQ; Wang, JC; Li, YZ; Zhang, HL; Xiang, Y; Zhang, YW; Shao, ZZ; Wu, P; Lu, D; Lin, HJ; Tong, ZW; Liu, J; Dong, Q"
90,"Genistein and Sex Hormone Supplementation Modulated Hepatic PPARα, δ, and γ Subtypes and STAT1 Expressions in a NASH Rat Model with Bilateral Orchidectomy","Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is a progressive form of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) that is characterized by hepatic inflammation and steatosis. Currently, limited data exist regarding the risk of NASH in transgender women and the treatment options for this particular population. The use of testosterone supplementation is unfavorable for transgender women, and estrogen supplementation is linked to an increased risk of breast cancer; thus, an isoflavone derivative compound known as ""genistein"" could serve as a viable substitute for a hormone supplement in this context. The purpose of this study was to investigate the treatment effects and mechanisms of actions of genistein and sex hormones in orchidectomized (ORX) rats with nonalcoholic steatohepatitis induced via a high-fat high-fructose diet (HFHF) model. Male Sprague-Dawley rats (n = 42) were randomly assigned into seven groups; control, ORX + standard diet, HFHF, ORX + HFHF, ORX + HFHF diet + testosterone (50 mg/kg body weight (BW) once weekly), ORX + HFHF diet + estradiol (1.6 mg/kg BW daily), and ORX + HFHF diet + genistein (16 mg/kg BW daily). The duration of the study was 6 weeks. Some parts of liver tissue were used for histological examination by H&E staining. The determination of fat accumulation was performed using Oil Red O staining. SREBP1c and FAS gene expression were quantified using real-time PCR technique. The levels of all types of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs; alpha, delta, gamma), proteins, and signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 (STAT1) signaling pathway were determined by both immunoblotting and immunohistochemistry. Rats in the ORX + HFHF group had the highest degree of hepatic steatosis, lobular inflammation, and hepatocyte ballooning, and showed higher levels of genes related to de novo lipogenesis, including SREBP1c and FAS. The expression of PPAR gamma and STAT1 were upregulated, while the expression of PPAR alpha and PPAR delta were downregulated in the ORX + HFHF group. Testosterone, estradiol and genistein treatments improved NASH histopathology together with the reversal of all types of PPAR protein expressions. Interestingly, genistein decreased the levels of STAT1 protein expression more than those of testosterone and estradiol treatment. Genistein and sex hormone treatment could ameliorate NASH through the upregulation of PPAR alpha, and PPAR delta, and the suppression of PPAR gamma and STAT1 expression.",10.3390/biomedicines12030483,"Okrit, F; Chayanupatkul, M; Siriviriyakul, P; Wanpiyarat, N; Werawatganon, D"
91,Hepatic Steatosis (Fatty Liver Disease) in Asymptomatic Adults Identified by Unenhanced Low-Dose CT,"OBJECTIVE. The purpose of this study was to investigate the prevalence of hepatic steatosis in an asymptomatic U. S. adult population using attenuation values at unenhanced CT as the reference standard. We also assessed the utility of known clinical risk factors for diagnosis. MATERIALS AND METHODS. For 3,357 consecutive asymptomatic adults (1,865 women and 1,492 men; mean age, 57.0 years), hepatic and splenic CT attenuation values (Hounsfield units) were obtained by unenhanced CT using a low-dose colonography technique for colorectal cancer screening. Multiple attenuation criteria for steatosis were applied, including liver thresholds and comparison of liver and spleen attenuation. Relevant clinical risk factors were compared against a CT liver attenuation <= 40 HU, which has been shown to exclude mild steatosis. RESULTS. Mean liver attenuation was 58.8 +/- 10.8 (SD) HU. The prevalence of moderate-to-severe hepatic steatosis (defined by liver attenuation <= 40 HU) was 6.2% (208/3,357). For CT attenuation criteria that include milder degrees of steatosis, prevalence increased to as high as 45.9% (1,542/3,357) for a liver-to-spleen attenuation ratio of <= 1.1. Overweight status (body mass index >25) was a sensitive indicator for moderate-to-severe steatosis (92.8%) but was highly nonspecific (37.5%). Other clinical risk factors, such as diabetes, dyslipidemia, hypertension, alcohol overuse, and hepatitis, were more specific (77.6-92.4%) but highly insensitive (1.9-37.5%). Combining clinical risk factors did not substantially increase the accuracy for screening. CONCLUSION. Assessment of liver attenuation by use of unenhanced CT represents an objective and noninvasive means for detection of asymptomatic hepatic steatosis, whereas clinical risk factor assessment is unreliable. Further longitudinal investigation is needed to determine the most appropriate attenuation threshold and the risk for disease progression to steatohepatitis and cirrhosis.",10.2214/AJR.09.2590,"Boyce, CJ; Pickhardt, PJ; Kim, DH; Taylor, AJ; Winter, TC; Bruce, RJ; Lindstrom, MJ; Hinshaw, JL"
92,Risk for hepatic and extra-hepatic outcomes in nonalcoholic fatty liver disease,"Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is defined by presence of steatosis in more than 5% of liver cells. The gold standard for diagnosis is liver biopsy, but this is seldom achieved due to costs and risk for side effects, and that is why the diagnosis is mostly made based on a combination of radiology and exclusion of other liver diseases. Disease severity staging can be noninvasively achieved with radiological exams such as elastography or blood-based markers that usually have lower sensitivity and specificity. NAFLD is today the most common chronic liver disease globally with a prevalence estimated to be 25%. Fortunately, for many persons NAFLD is an incidental finding with a good prognosis. Whilst a major focus has been on liver-related outcomes in NAFLD, there has recently been an increased interest in extrahepatic consequences of NAFLD. The most commonly studied outcomes include cardiovascular disease and cancer. The risk of adverse outcomes generally differs according to the baseline fibrosis stage. There is a five-time higher risk of liver-related events in NAFLD patients with fibrosis stage 3 as compared to those with no or little fibrosis. Meanwhile, the presence of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) does not seem to influence prognosis in addition to fibrosis stage. Patients with NAFLD clearly have a higher risk for cardiovascular outcomes compared to the general population, with a recent meta-analysis indicating a 37% increased hazard for cardiovascular events as opposed to individuals without NAFLD. The risk of liver cancer is increased, which is mostly driven by presence of cirrhosis, but the increased risk is present also in patients without cirrhosis, and to a greater extent than for other chronic liver disease. Around one-third of patients with NAFLD and liver cancer do not have cirrhosis. Additionally, the risk of extrahepatic malignancies is thought to be moderately increased, with most evidence for a link between NAFLD and colorectal cancer where the risk is approximately 50% higher compared to patients without NAFLD. A particularly salient point is if NAFLD can be considered an independent risk factor for outcomes. Many studies have not been able to adjust for key confounders, or suffer from different forms of bias. The clinical problem is nevertheless to identify persons with an increased risk for adverse hepatic and extrahepatic outcomes. We here discuss the evidence linking NAFLD to severe hepatic and extrahepatic outcomes.",10.1111/joim.13343,"Hagström, H; Kechagias, S; Ekstedt, M"
93,New-Onset Age of Nonalcoholic Fatty Liver Disease and Cancer Risk,"IMPORTANCE The onset age of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is decreasing, and whether earlier ages of NAFLD onset are associated with increased cancer risk is currently unclear. OBJECTIVE To explore the association between NAFLD new-onset age and cancer risk. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This cohort study was conducted among 179 328 participants included in the Kailuan Cohort Study between 2006 and 2021. In total, 46 100 incident NAFLD cases were identified. For each case, a participant matched by age (older or younger by 1 year) and sex was randomly selected to create a new matched study cohort. Data were analyzed from December 2022 through April 2023. EXPOSURE Onset of NAFLD. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The association between the onset age of NAFLD and the risk of different cancer types was evaluated using weighted Cox regression models. Populationattributable fractions (PAFs) were used to quantify the association of NAFLD with cancer risk at different ages. RESULTS Among 63 696 participants (mean [SD] age, 51.37 [12.43] years; 10 932 females [17.2%] and 52 764 males [82.8%]), 31 848 individuals had NAFLD and 31 848 individuals were in the control group. During a median (IQR) follow-up of 10.16 (7.89-11.67) years, 2415 patients were diagnosed with cancer. Compared with the matched group, patients aged less than 45 years at NAFLD onset exhibited a higher risk of cancer (average hazard ratio [AHR], 1.52; 95% CI, 1.09-2.12), and as the onset age of NAFLD increased, the cancer risk decreased (ages 45-54 years: AHR, 1.50; 95% CI, 1.15-1.97; ages 55-64 years: AHR, 1.13; 95% CI, 0.97-1.33; ages >65 years: AHR, 0.75; 95% CI, 0.45-1.27; P for interaction <.001). Among patients aged less than 45 years at NAFLD onset, cancers were mainly digestive system and lung cancers, with AHR values of 2.00 (95% CI, 1.08-3.47) and 2.14 (95% CI, 1.05-4.36), respectively. PAFs also showed that in patients aged less than 45 years at NAFLD onset, 17.83%(95% CI, 4.92%-29.86%) of cancer risk was attributable to NAFLD. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE This study found that NAFLD was associated with increased cancer risk and there was an interaction with onset age, such that the younger the onset age of NAFLD, the greater the cancer risk.",10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2023.35511,"Liu, CA; Liu, T; Zhang, QS; Jia, PP; Song, MM; Zhang, Q; Ruan, GT; Ge, YZ; Lin, SQ; Wang, ZW; Xie, HL; Shi, JY; Han, RQ; Chen, Y; Zheng, X; Shen, LY; Deng, L; Wu, SL; Shi, HP"

95,Diagnosis of Non-Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD) Is Independently Associated with Cardiovascular Risk in a Large Austrian Screening Cohort,"Background: Many patients with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) simultaneously suffer from cardiovascular (CV) disease and often carry multiple CV risk factors. Several CV risk factors are known to drive the progression of fibrosis in patients with NAFLD. Objectives: To investigate whether an established CV risk score, the Framingham risk score (FRS), is associated with the diagnosis of NAFLD and the degree of fibrosis in an Austrian screening cohort for colorectal cancer. Material and Methods: In total, 1965 asymptomatic subjects (59 +/- 10 years, 52% females, BMI 27.2 +/- 4.9 kg/m(2)) were included in this study. The diagnosis of NAFLD was present if (1) significantly increased echogenicity in relation to the renal parenchyma was present in ultrasound and (2) viral, autoimmune or hereditary liver disease and excess alcohol consumption were excluded. The FRS (ten-year risk of coronary heart disease) and NAFLD Fibrosis Score (NFS) were calculated for all patients. High CV risk was defined as the highest FRS quartile (>10%). Both univariable and multivariable logistic regression models were used to calculate associations of FRS with NAFLD and NFS. Results: Compared to patients without NAFLD (n = 990), patients with NAFLD (n = 975) were older (60 +/- 9 vs. 58 +/- 10 years; p < 0.001), had higher BMI (29.6 +/- 4.9 vs. 24.9 +/- 3.6 kg/m(2); p < 0.001) and suffered from metabolic syndrome more frequently (33% vs. 7%; p < 0.001). Cardiovascular risk as assessed by FRS was higher in the NAFLD-group (8.7 +/- 6.4 vs. 5.4 +/- 5.2%; p < 0.001). A one-percentage-point increase of FRS was independently associated with NAFLD (OR 1.04, 95%CI 1.02-1.07; p < 0.001) after correction for relevant confounders in multivariable logistic regression. In patients with NAFLD, NFS correlated with FRS (r = 0.29; p < 0.001), and FRS was highest in patients with significant fibrosis (F3-4; 11.7 +/- 5.4) compared to patients with intermediate results (10.9 +/- 6.3) and those in which advanced fibrosis could be ruled-out (F0-2, 7.8 +/- 5.9, p < 0.001). A one-point-increase of NFS was an independent predictor of high-risk FRS after correction for sex, age, and concomitant diagnosis of metabolic syndrome (OR 1.30, 95%CI 1.09-1.54; p = 0.003). Conclusion: The presence of NAFLD might independently improve prediction of long-term risk for CV disease and the diagnosis of NAFLD might be a clinically relevant piece in the puzzle of predicting long-term CV outcomes. Due to the significant overlap of advanced NAFLD and high CV risk, aggressive treatment of established CV risk factors could improve prognosis in these patients.",10.3390/jcm9041065,"Niederseer, D; Wernly, S; Bachmayer, S; Wernly, B; Bakula, A; Huber-Schönauer, U; Semmler, G; Schmied, C; Aigner, E; Datz, C"

98,Short-term postoperative outcomes of colorectal cancer among patients with chronic liver disease: a national population-based study,"Objective Patients with colorectal carcinoma (CRC) with pre-existing chronic liver disease (CLD) had a significantly higher 30-day mortality after CRC surgery compared with healthy controls. This study investigated the factors associated with postoperative complications and in-hospital mortality in patients with CRC with coexisting CLD (excluding cirrhosis) who underwent colorectal surgery. Design A retrospective, observational, population-based study. Setting Data were sourced from the National Inpatient Sample database, a part of the Healthcare Cost and Utilisation Project. Participants This study analysed 7463 inpatients with CRC who underwent colorectal surgery on admission between 2005 and 2014. Primary and secondary outcome measures The primary endpoint of this study was the prevalence of postoperative complications, and the secondary endpoint was in-hospital mortality. Results In the CLD group, 36.27% of patients had chronic hepatitis C, 28.36% had non-alcoholic fatty liver disease and 31.19% had other types of CLD. The median hospital stay was 7.0 (5.0-10.0) days in patients with no postoperative complications vs 17.0 (10.0-26.0) days, 8.0 (6.0-12.0) days, 8.0 (6.0-17.0) days, 9.0 (8.0-14.0) days and 10.5 (7.0-17.0) days for patients with postoperative infection, postoperative bleeding, cardiac arrest/heart failure, respiratory complications and digestive complications, respectively (all p<0.05). The presence of CLD was significantly associated with higher risk of postoperative bleeding (adjusted OR (aOR)=1.64, 95% CI 1.15 to 2.34, p=0.007). The presence of CLD (aOR=1.98, 95% CI 1.39 to 2.82, p<0.001) and length of hospital stay (aOR=1.06, 95% CI 1.04 to 1.08, p<0.001) were significantly associated with higher risk of in-hospital mortality. However, hyperlipidaemia was associated with a significantly lower risk of mortality (aOR=0.46, 95% CI 0.28 to 0.75, p=0.002). Conclusions Postoperative complications prolonged the length of hospital stay. The presence of CLD and hyperlipidaemia were important factors impacting postoperative complications and in-hospital mortality in patients with CRC with underlying CLD.",10.1136/bmjopen-2017-020511,"Lee, KC; Chung, KC; Chen, HH; Cheng, KC; Wu, KL; Lu, CC"
