0,"Pembrolizumab in combination with gemcitabine and cisplatin compared with gemcitabine and cisplatin alone for patients with advanced biliary tract cancer (KEYNOTE-966): a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 3 trial.",10.1016/S0140-6736(23)00727-4,"BACKGROUND: Biliary tract cancers, which arise from the intrahepatic or extrahepatic bile ducts and the gallbladder, generally have a poor prognosis and are rising in incidence worldwide. The standard-of-care treatment for advanced biliary tract cancer is chemotherapy with gemcitabine and cisplatin. Because most biliary tract cancers have an immune-suppressed microenvironment, immune checkpoint inhibitor monotherapy is associated with a low objective response rate. We aimed to assess whether adding the immune checkpoint inhibitor pembrolizumab to gemcitabine and cisplatin would improve outcomes compared with gemcitabine and cisplatin alone in patients with advanced biliary tract cancer. METHODS: KEYNOTE-966 was a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 3 trial done at 175 medical centres globally. Eligible participants were aged 18 years or older; had previously untreated, unresectable, locally advanced or metastatic biliary tract cancer; had disease measurable per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumours version 1.1; and had an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0 or 1. Eligible participants were randomly assigned (1:1) to pembrolizumab 200 mg or placebo, both administered intravenously every 3 weeks (maximum 35 cycles), in combination with gemcitabine (1000 mg/m(2) intravenously on days 1 and 8 every 3 weeks; no maximum duration) and cisplatin (25 mg/m(2) intravenously on days 1 and 8 every 3 weeks; maximum 8 cycles). Randomisation was done using a central interactive voice-response system and stratified by geographical region, disease stage, and site of origin in block sizes of four. The primary endpoint of overall survival was evaluated in the intention-to-treat population. The secondary endpoint of safety was evaluated in the as-treated population. This study is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04003636. FINDINGS: Between Oct 4, 2019, and June 8, 2021, 1564 patients were screened for eligibility, 1069 of whom were randomly assigned to pembrolizumab plus gemcitabine and cisplatin (pembrolizumab group; n=533) or placebo plus gemcitabine and cisplatin (placebo group; n=536). Median study follow-up at final analysis was 25·6 months (IQR 21·7-30·4). Median overall survival was 12·7 months (95% CI 11·5-13·6) in the pembrolizumab group versus 10·9 months (9·9-11·6) in the placebo group (hazard ratio 0·83 [95% CI 0·72-0·95]; one-sided p=0·0034 [significance threshold, p=0·0200]). In the as-treated population, the maximum adverse event grade was 3 to 4 in 420 (79%) of 529 participants in the pembrolizumab group and 400 (75%) of 534 in the placebo group; 369 (70%) participants in the pembrolizumab group and 367 (69%) in the placebo group had treatment-related adverse events with a maximum grade of 3 to 4. 31 (6%) participants in the pembrolizumab group and 49 (9%) in the placebo group died due to adverse events, including eight (2%) in the pembrolizumab group and three (1%) in the placebo group who died due to treatment-related adverse events. INTERPRETATION: Based on a statistically significant, clinically meaningful improvement in overall survival compared with gemcitabine and cisplatin without any new safety signals, pembrolizumab plus gemcitabine and cisplatin could be a new treatment option for patients with previously untreated metastatic or unresectable biliary tract cancer.

1,Lenvatinib versus sorafenib in first-line treatment of patients with unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma: a randomised phase 3 non-inferiority trial.,10.1016/S0140-6736(18)30207-1,"BACKGROUND: In a phase 2 trial, lenvatinib, an inhibitor of VEGF receptors 1-3, FGF receptors 1-4, PDGF receptor α, RET, and KIT, showed activity in hepatocellular carcinoma. We aimed to compare overall survival in patients treated with lenvatinib versus sorafenib as a first-line treatment for unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma. METHODS: This was an open-label, phase 3, multicentre, non-inferiority trial that recruited patients with unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma, who had not received treatment for advanced disease, at 154 sites in 20 countries throughout the Asia-Pacific, European, and North American regions. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) via an interactive voice-web response system-with region; macroscopic portal vein invasion, extrahepatic spread, or both; Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status; and bodyweight as stratification factors-to receive oral lenvatinib (12 mg/day for bodyweight ≥60 kg or 8 mg/day for bodyweight <60 kg) or sorafenib 400 mg twice-daily in 28-day cycles. The primary endpoint was overall survival, measured from the date of randomisation until the date of death from any cause. The efficacy analysis followed the intention-to-treat principle, and only patients who received treatment were included in the safety analysis. The non-inferiority margin was set at 1·08. The trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01761266. FINDINGS: Between March 1, 2013 and July 30, 2015, 1492 patients were recruited. 954 eligible patients were randomly assigned to lenvatinib (n=478) or sorafenib (n=476). Median survival time for lenvatinib of 13·6 months (95% CI 12·1-14·9) was non-inferior to sorafenib (12·3 months, 10·4-13·9; hazard ratio 0·92, 95% CI 0·79-1·06), meeting criteria for non-inferiority. The most common any-grade adverse events were hypertension (201 [42%]), diarrhoea (184 [39%]), decreased appetite (162 [34%]), and decreased weight (147 [31%]) for lenvatinib, and palmar-plantar erythrodysaesthesia (249 [52%]), diarrhoea (220 [46%]), hypertension (144 [30%]), and decreased appetite (127 [27%]) for sorafenib. INTERPRETATION: Lenvatinib was non-inferior to sorafenib in overall survival in untreated advanced hepatocellular carcinoma. The safety and tolerability profiles of lenvatinib were consistent with those previously observed.

2,Atezolizumab plus Bevacizumab in Unresectable Hepatocellular Carcinoma.,10.1056/NEJMoa1915745,"BACKGROUND: The combination of atezolizumab and bevacizumab showed encouraging antitumor activity and safety in a phase 1b trial involving patients with unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma. METHODS: In a global, open-label, phase 3 trial, patients with unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma who had not previously received systemic treatment were randomly assigned in a 2:1 ratio to receive either atezolizumab plus bevacizumab or sorafenib until unacceptable toxic effects occurred or there was a loss of clinical benefit. The coprimary end points were overall survival and progression-free survival in the intention-to-treat population, as assessed at an independent review facility according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors, version 1.1 (RECIST 1.1). RESULTS: The intention-to-treat population included 336 patients in the atezolizumab-bevacizumab group and 165 patients in the sorafenib group. At the time of the primary analysis (August 29, 2019), the hazard ratio for death with atezolizumab-bevacizumab as compared with sorafenib was 0.58 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.42 to 0.79; P<0.001). Overall survival at 12 months was 67.2% (95% CI, 61.3 to 73.1) with atezolizumab-bevacizumab and 54.6% (95% CI, 45.2 to 64.0) with sorafenib. Median progression-free survival was 6.8 months (95% CI, 5.7 to 8.3) and 4.3 months (95% CI, 4.0 to 5.6) in the respective groups (hazard ratio for disease progression or death, 0.59; 95% CI, 0.47 to 0.76; P<0.001). Grade 3 or 4 adverse events occurred in 56.5% of 329 patients who received at least one dose of atezolizumab-bevacizumab and in 55.1% of 156 patients who received at least one dose of sorafenib. Grade 3 or 4 hypertension occurred in 15.2% of patients in the atezolizumab-bevacizumab group; however, other high-grade toxic effects were infrequent. CONCLUSIONS: In patients with unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma, atezolizumab combined with bevacizumab resulted in better overall and progression-free survival outcomes than sorafenib.

3,Updated efficacy and safety data from IMbrave150: Atezolizumab plus bevacizumab vs. sorafenib for unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma.,10.1016/j.jhep.2021.11.030,"BACKGROUND & AIMS: IMbrave150 demonstrated that atezolizumab plus bevacizumab led to significantly improved overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) compared with sorafenib in patients with unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma at the primary analysis (after a median 8.6 months of follow-up). We present updated data after 12 months of additional follow-up. METHODS: Patients with systemic treatment-naive, unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma were randomized 2:1 to receive 1,200 mg atezolizumab plus 15 mg/kg bevacizumab intravenously every 3 weeks or 400 mg sorafenib orally twice daily in this open-label, phase III study. Co-primary endpoints were OS and PFS by independently assessed RECIST 1.1 in the intention-to-treat population. Secondary efficacy endpoints included objective response rates and exploratory subgroup efficacy analyses. This is a post hoc updated analysis of efficacy and safety. RESULTS: From March 15, 2018, to January 30, 2019, 501 patients (intention-to-treat population) were randomly allocated to receive atezolizumab plus bevacizumab (n = 336) or sorafenib (n = 165). On August 31, 2020, after a median 15.6 (range, 0-28.6) months of follow-up, the median OS was 19.2 months (95% CI 17.0-23.7) with atezolizumab plus bevacizumab and 13.4 months (95% CI 11.4-16.9) with sorafenib (hazard ratio [HR] 0.66; 95% CI 0.52-0.85; descriptive p <0.001). The median PFS was 6.9 (95% CI 5.7-8.6) and 4.3 (95% CI 4.0-5.6) months in the respective treatment groups (HR 0.65; 95% CI 0.53-0.81; descriptive p < 0.001). Treatment-related grade 3/4 adverse events occurred in 143 (43%) of 329 and 72 (46%) of 156 safety-evaluable patients in the respective groups, and treatment-related grade 5 events occurred in 6 (2%) and 1 (<1%) patients. CONCLUSION: After longer follow-up, atezolizumab plus bevacizumab maintained clinically meaningful survival benefits over sorafenib and had a safety profile consistent with the primary analysis. GOV IDENTIFIER: NCT03434379. LAY SUMMARY: The primary analysis of IMbrave150 showed that atezolizumab plus bevacizumab had significantly greater benefits than sorafenib in patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma, but survival data were not yet mature. At this updated analysis done 12 months later, median overall survival was 5.8 months longer with atezolizumab plus bevacizumab than sorafenib, and the severity profile of treatment-related side effects remained similar. These updated results confirm atezolizumab plus bevacizumab as the first-line standard of care for advanced hepatocellular carcinoma.",Cheng AL; Qin S; Ikeda M; Galle PR; Ducreux M; Kim TY; Lim HY; Kudo M; Breder V; Merle P; Kaseb AO; Li D; Verret W; Ma N; Nicholas A; Wang Y; Li L; Zhu AX; Finn RS,False,study design mismatch (not CheckMate RCT),patients with unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma,atezolizumab plus bevacizumab,sorafenib,overall survival and progression-free survival,"open-label, phase III study",False,"Model A correctly identified the study design mismatch.

4,"Camrelizumab plus rivoceranib versus sorafenib as first-line therapy for unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (CARES-310): a randomised, open-label, international phase 3 study.",10.1016/S0140-6736(23)00961-3,"BACKGROUND: Immunotherapy with immune checkpoint inhibitors combined with an anti-angiogenic tyrosine-kinase inhibitor (TKI) has been shown to improve overall survival versus anti-angiogenic therapy alone in advanced solid tumours, but not in hepatocellular carcinoma. Therefore, a clinical study was conducted to compare the efficacy and safety of the anti-PD-1 antibody camrelizumab plus the VEGFR2-targeted TKI rivoceranib (also known as apatinib) versus sorafenib as first-line treatment for unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma. METHODS: This randomised, open-label, international phase 3 trial (CARES-310) was done at 95 study sites across 13 countries and regions worldwide. Patients with unresectable or metastatic hepatocellular carcinoma who had not previously received any systemic treatment were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive either camrelizumab 200 mg intravenously every 2 weeks plus rivoceranib 250 mg orally once daily or sorafenib 400 mg orally twice daily. Randomisation was done via a centralised interactive response system. The primary endpoints were progression-free survival, as assessed by the blinded independent review committee per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumours version 1.1, and overall survival in the intention-to-treat population. Safety was assessed in all patients who received at least one dose of the study drugs. We report the findings from the prespecified primary analysis for progression-free survival and interim analysis for overall survival. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT03764293). FINDINGS: Between June 28, 2019, and March 24, 2021, 543 patients were randomly assigned to the camrelizumab-rivoceranib (n=272) or sorafenib (n=271) group. At the primary analysis for progression-free survival (May 10, 2021), median follow-up was 7·8 months (IQR 4·1-10·6). Median progression-free survival was significantly improved with camrelizumab-rivoceranib versus sorafenib (5·6 months [95% CI 5·5-6·3] vs 3·7 months [2·8-3·7]; hazard ratio [HR] 0·52 [95% CI 0·41-0·65]; one-sided p<0·0001). At the interim analysis for overall survival (Feb 8, 2022), median follow-up was 14·5 months (IQR 9·1-18·7). Median overall survival was significantly extended with camrelizumab-rivoceranib versus sorafenib (22·1 months [95% CI 19·1-27·2] vs 15·2 months [13·0-18·5]; HR 0·62 [95% CI 0·49-0·80]; one-sided p<0·0001). The most common grade 3 or 4 treatment-related adverse events were hypertension (102 [38%] of 272 patients in the camrelizumab-rivoceranib group vs 40 [15%] of 269 patients in the sorafenib group), palmar-plantar erythrodysaesthesia syndrome (33 [12%] vs 41 [15%]), increased aspartate aminotransferase (45 [17%] vs 14 [5%]), and increased alanine aminotransferase (35 [13%] vs eight [3%]). Treatment-related serious adverse events were reported in 66 (24%) patients in the camrelizumab-rivoceranib group and 16 (6%) in the sorafenib group. Treatment-related death occurred in two patients: one patient in the camrelizumab-rivoceranib group (ie, multiple organ dysfunction syndrome) and one patient in the sorafenib group (ie, respiratory failure and circulatory collapse). INTERPRETATION: Camrelizumab plus rivoceranib showed a statistically significant and clinically meaningful benefit in progression-free survival and overall survival compared with sorafenib for patients with unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma, presenting as a new and effective first-line treatment option for this population.

METHODS: In this global, open-label, phase 3 trial, the majority of the patients we enrolled with unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma and no previous systemic treatment were randomly assigned to receive one of three regimens: tremelimumab (300 mg, one dose) plus durvalumab (1500 mg every 4 weeks; STRIDE), durvalumab (1500 mg every 4 weeks), or sorafenib (400 mg twice daily). The primary objective was overall survival for STRIDE versus sorafenib. Noninferiority for overall survival for durvalumab versus sorafenib was a secondary objective. RESULTS: In total, 1171 patients were randomly assigned to STRIDE (n=393), durvalumab (n=389), or sorafenib (n=389). The median overall survival was 16.43 months (95% confidence interval [CI], 14.16 to 19.58) with STRIDE, 16.56 months (95% CI, 14.06 to 19.12) with durvalumab, and 13.77 months (95% CI, 12.25 to 16.13) with sorafenib. Overall survival at 36 months was 30.7%, 24.7%, and 20.2%, respectively. The overall survival hazard ratio for STRIDE versus sorafenib was 0.78 (96.02% CI, 0.65 to 0.93; P=0.0035). Overall survival with durvalumab monotherapy was noninferior to sorafenib (hazard ratio, 0.86; 95.67% CI, 0.73 to 1.03; noninferiority margin, 1.08). Median progression-free survival was not significantly different among all three groups. Grade 3/4 treatment-emergent adverse events occurred for 50.5% of patients with STRIDE, 37.1% with durvalumab, and 52.4% with sorafenib.

6,Four-year overall survival update from the phase III HIMALAYA study of tremelimumab plus durvalumab in unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma.,10.1016/j.annonc.2024.02.005,"BACKGROUND: In the phase III HIMALAYA study (NCT03298451) in unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (uHCC), STRIDE (Single Tremelimumab Regular Interval Durvalumab) significantly improved overall survival (OS) versus sorafenib; durvalumab monotherapy was noninferior to sorafenib for OS. Results reported herein are from a 4-year updated OS analysis of HIMALAYA. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Participants with uHCC and no previous systemic treatment were randomized to STRIDE (n = 393), durvalumab (n = 389), or sorafenib (n = 389). The updated data cut-off was 23 January 2023. OS and serious adverse events (AEs) were assessed. Additionally, baseline characteristics and subsequent therapies were analyzed in long-term survivors (≥36 months beyond randomization). RESULTS: For STRIDE, durvalumab, and sorafenib, median [95% confidence interval (CI)] follow-up was 49.12 months (46.95-50.17 months), 48.46 months (46.82-49.81 months), and 47.31 months (45.08-49.15 months), respectively. OS hazard ratio (95% CI) for STRIDE versus sorafenib was 0.78 (0.67-0.92). The 36-month OS rate for STRIDE was 30.7% versus 19.8% for sorafenib. The 48-month OS rate remained higher for STRIDE at 25.2%, versus 15.1% for sorafenib. The long-term OS benefit of STRIDE was observed across clinically relevant subgroups and was further improved in participants who achieved disease control. Long-term survivors with STRIDE (n = 103) included participants across clinically relevant subgroups, and 57.3% (59/103) had no reported subsequent anticancer therapy. No new serious treatment-related AEs occurred with STRIDE from the primary analysis (17.5%; 68/388). Durvalumab maintained OS noninferiority to sorafenib and no late-onset safety signals were identified. CONCLUSIONS: These data represent the longest follow-up to date in phase III studies in uHCC. The unprecedented 3- and 4-year OS rates reinforce the sustained long-term OS benefit of STRIDE versus sorafenib. STRIDE maintained a tolerable yet differentiated safety profile from other current uHCC therapies.

We investigated the efficacy of nivolumab plus oxaliplatin-based chemotherapy versus placebo plus oxaliplatin-based chemotherapy as first-line therapy for patients with HER2-negative, unresectable advanced or recurrent gastric or gastro-oesophageal junction cancer. METHODS: We did a randomised, multicentre, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 2-3 trial (ATTRACTION-4) at 130 centres (hospitals, cancer centres, and medical centres) across Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan. We enrolled patients aged 20 years and older with previously untreated (except for neoadjuvant or adjuvant chemotherapy completed ≥180 days before recurrence), HER2-negative, unresectable, advanced or recurrent gastric or gastro-oesophageal junction cancer (regardless of PD-L1 expression), at least one measurable lesion per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumours guidelines (version 1.1), and a baseline Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0 or 1. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) to chemotherapy every 3 weeks (intravenous oxaliplatin 130 mg/m(2) on day 1 plus either oral S-1 40 mg/m(2) [SOX] or oral capecitabine 1000 mg/m(2) [CAPOX], twice daily on days 1-14), in addition to either 360 mg nivolumab intravenously every 3 weeks (nivolumab plus chemotherapy group) or placebo (placebo plus chemotherapy group). Randomisation was done using an interactive web response system with block sizes of four and stratified by intensity of PD-L1 expression, ECOG performance status score, disease status, and geographical region. Patients, investigators, and the study sponsor were masked to treatment assignment. The primary endpoints were centrally assessed progression-free survival and overall survival in the intention-to-treat population, which included all randomly assigned patients. Safety was assessed in all patients who received at least one dose of the assigned treatment. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT02746796. Trial recruitment is complete and follow-up is ongoing. FINDINGS: Between March 23, 2017, and May 10, 2018, 724 patients were randomly assigned to treatment: 362 patients to the nivolumab plus chemotherapy group and 362 to the placebo plus chemotherapy group. At the time of data cutoff on Oct 31, 2018, with a median follow-up of 11·6 months (IQR 8·7-14·1), median progression-free survival at a prespecified interim analysis was 10·45 months (95% CI 8·44-14·75) in the nivolumab plus chemotherapy group and 8·34 months (6·97-9·40) in the placebo plus chemotherapy group (hazard ratio [HR] 0·68; 98·51% CI 0·51-0·90; p=0·0007). At the time of data cutoff on Jan 31, 2020, with a median follow-up of 26·6 months (IQR 24·1-29·0), median overall survival at the final analysis was 17·45 months (95% CI 15·67-20·83) in the nivolumab plus chemotherapy group and 17·15 months (15·18-19·65) in the placebo plus chemotherapy group (HR 0·90; 95% CI 0·75-1·08; p=0·26). The most common treatment-related grade 3-4 adverse events were neutrophil count decreased (71 [20%] of 359 patients in the nivolumab plus chemotherapy group vs 57 [16%] of 358 patients in the placebo plus chemotherapy group) and platelet count decreased (34 [9%] vs 33 [9%]). Treatment-related serious adverse events of any grade were observed in 88 (25%) patients in the nivolumab plus chemotherapy group and in 51 (14%) in the placebo plus chemotherapy group, of which the most common was decreased appetite (18 [5%] vs ten [3%]). Six treatment-related deaths occurred: three in the nivolumab plus chemotherapy group (one each of febrile neutropenia, hepatic failure, and sudden death) and three in the placebo plus chemotherapy group (one each of sepsis, haemolytic anaemia, and interstitial lung disease). INTERPRETATION: Nivolumab combined with oxaliplatin-based chemotherapy significantly improved progression-free survival, but not overall survival, in Asian patients with untreated, HER2-negative, unresectable advanced or recurrent gastric or gastro-oesophageal junction cancer, and could potentially be a new first-line treatment option for these patients.

Therefore, we aimed to compare clinical outcomes of LEN combined with transarterial chemoembolization (LEN-TACE) versus LEN monotherapy in patients with advanced HCC. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This was a multicenter, randomized, open-label, parallel group, phase III trial. Patients with primary treatment-naive or initial recurrent advanced HCC after surgery were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive LEN plus on-demand TACE (LEN-TACE) or LEN monotherapy. LEN was initiated within 3 days after random assignment (initial dose: 12 mg once daily for patients ≥ 60 kg; 8 mg once daily for patients < 60 kg). TACE was initiated one day after LEN initiation. The primary end point was overall survival (OS). RESULTS: Between June 2019 and July 2021, a total of 338 patients underwent random assignment at 12 centers in China: 170 to LEN-TACE and 168 to LEN. At a prespecified event-driven interim analysis after a median follow-up of 17.0 months, the median OS was significantly longer in the LEN-TACE group (17.8 v 11.5 months; hazard ratio, 0.45; P < .001). The median progression-free survival was 10.6 months in the LEN-TACE group and 6.4 months in the LEN group (hazard ratio, 0.43; P < .001). Patients in the LEN-TACE group had a higher objective response rate according to the modified RECIST (54.1% v 25.0%, P < .001). Multivariable analysis revealed that portal vein tumor thrombus and treatment allocation were independent risk factors for OS.

9,"Lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab versus lenvatinib plus placebo for advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (LEAP-002): a randomised, double-blind, phase 3 trial.",10.1016/S1470-2045(23)00469-2,"BACKGROUND: Systemic therapies have improved the management of hepatocellular carcinoma, but there is still a need to further enhance overall survival in first-line advanced stages. This study aimed to evaluate the addition of pembrolizumab to lenvatinib versus lenvatinib plus placebo in the first-line setting for unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma. METHODS: In this global, randomised, double-blind, phase 3 study (LEAP-002), patients aged 18 years or older with unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma, Child Pugh class A liver disease, an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0 or 1, and no previous systemic treatment were enrolled at 172 global sites. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) with a central interactive voice-response system (block size of 4) to receive lenvatinib (bodyweight <60 kg, 8 mg/day; bodyweight ≥60 kg, 12 mg/day) plus pembrolizumab (200 mg every 3 weeks) or lenvatinib plus placebo. Randomisation was stratified by geographical region, macrovascular portal vein invasion or extrahepatic spread or both, α-fetoprotein concentration, and Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status. Dual primary endpoints were overall survival (superiority threshold at final overall survival analysis, one-sided p=0·019; final analysis to occur after 532 events) and progression-free survival (superiority threshold one-sided p=0·002; final analysis to occur after 571 events) in the intention-to-treat population. Results from the final analysis are reported. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03713593, and is active but not recruiting. FINDINGS: Between Jan 17, 2019, and April 28, 2020, of 1309 patients assessed, 794 were randomly assigned to lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab (n=395) or lenvatinib plus placebo (n=399). Median age was 66·0 years (IQR 57·0-72·0), 644 (81%) of 794 were male, 150 (19%) were female, 345 (43%) were Asian, 345 (43%) were White, 22 (3%) were multiple races, 21 (3%) were American Indian or Alaska Native, 21 (3%) were Native Hawaiian or other Pacific Islander, 13 (2%) were Black or African American, and 46 (6%) did not have available race data. Median follow up as of data cutoff for the final analysis (June 21, 2022) was 32·1 months (IQR 29·4-35·3). Median overall survival was 21·2 months (95% CI 19·0-23·6; 252 [64%] of 395 died) with lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab versus 19·0 months (17·2-21·7; 282 [71%] of 399 died) with lenvatinib plus placebo (hazard ratio [HR] 0·84; 95% CI 0·71-1·00; stratified log-rank p=0·023). As of data cutoff for the progression-free survival final analysis (April 5, 2021), median progression-free survival was 8·2 months (95% CI 6·4-8·4; 270 events occurred [42 deaths; 228 progressions]) with lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab versus 8·0 months (6·3-8·2; 301 events occurred [36 deaths; 265 progressions]) with lenvatinib plus placebo (HR 0·87; 95% CI 0·73-1·02; stratified log-rank p=0·047). The most common treatment-related grade 3-4 adverse events were hypertension (69 [17%] of 395 patients in the lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab group vs 68 [17%] of 395 patients) in the lenvatinib plus placebo group), increased aspartate aminotransferase (27 [7%] vs 17 [4%]), and diarrhoea (25 [6%] vs 15 [4%]).

10,Cabozantinib in Patients with Advanced and Progressing Hepatocellular Carcinoma.,10.1056/NEJMoa1717002,"BACKGROUND: Cabozantinib inhibits tyrosine kinases, including vascular endothelial growth factor receptors 1, 2, and 3, MET, and AXL, which are implicated in the progression of hepatocellular carcinoma and the development of resistance to sorafenib, the standard initial treatment for advanced disease. This randomized, double-blind, phase 3 trial evaluated cabozantinib as compared with placebo in previously treated patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma. METHODS: A total of 707 patients were randomly assigned in a 2:1 ratio to receive cabozantinib (60 mg once daily) or matching placebo. Eligible patients had received previous treatment with sorafenib, had disease progression after at least one systemic treatment for hepatocellular carcinoma, and may have received up to two previous systemic regimens for advanced hepatocellular carcinoma. The primary end point was overall survival. Secondary end points were progression-free survival and the objective response rate. RESULTS: At the second planned interim analysis, the trial showed significantly longer overall survival with cabozantinib than with placebo. Median overall survival was 10.2 months with cabozantinib and 8.0 months with placebo (hazard ratio for death, 0.76; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.63 to 0.92; P=0.005). Median progression-free survival was 5.2 months with cabozantinib and 1.9 months with placebo (hazard ratio for disease progression or death, 0.44; 95% CI, 0.36 to 0.52; P<0.001), and the objective response rates were 4% and less than 1%, respectively (P=0.009). Grade 3 or 4 adverse events occurred in 68% of patients in the cabozantinib group and in 36% in the placebo group. The most common high-grade events were palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia (17% with cabozantinib vs. 0% with placebo), hypertension (16% vs. 2%), increased aspartate aminotransferase level (12% vs. 7%), fatigue (10% vs. 4%), and diarrhea (10% vs. 2%). CONCLUSIONS: Among patients with previously treated advanced hepatocellular carcinoma, treatment with cabozantinib resulted in longer overall survival and progression-free survival than placebo. The rate of high-grade adverse events in the cabozantinib group was approximately twice that observed in the placebo group.

We aimed to investigate nivolumab monotherapy compared with sorafenib monotherapy in the first-line setting for patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma. METHODS: In this randomised, open-label, phase 3 trial done at medical centres across 22 countries and territories in Asia, Australasia, Europe, and North America, patients at least 18 years old with histologically confirmed advanced hepatocellular carcinoma not eligible for, or whose disease had progressed after, surgery or locoregional treatment; with no previous systemic therapy for hepatocellular carcinoma, with Child-Pugh class A and Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status score of 0 or 1, and regardless of viral hepatitis status were randomly assigned (1:1) via an interactive voice response system to receive nivolumab (240 mg intravenously every 2 weeks) or sorafenib (400 mg orally twice daily) until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. The primary endpoint was overall survival assessed in the intention-to-treat population. Safety was assessed in all patients who received at least one dose of study drug. This completed trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT02576509. FINDINGS: Between Jan 11, 2016, and May 24, 2017, 743 patients were randomly assigned to treatment (nivolumab, n=371; sorafenib, n=372). At the primary analysis, the median follow-up for overall survival was 15·2 months (IQR 5·7-28·0) for the nivolumab group and 13·4 months (5·7-25·9) in the sorafenib group. Median overall survival was 16·4 months (95% CI 13·9-18·4) with nivolumab and 14·7 months (11·9-17·2) with sorafenib (hazard ratio 0·85 [95% CI 0·72-1·02]; p=0·075; minimum follow-up 22·8 months); the protocol-defined significance level of p=0·0419 was not reached. The most common grade 3 or worse treatment-related adverse events were palmar-plantar erythrodysaesthesia (1 [<1%] of 367 patients in the nivolumab group vs 52 [14%] of patients in the sorafenib group), aspartate aminotransferase increase (22 [6%] vs 13 [4%]), and hypertension (0 vs 26 [7%]). Serious treatment-related adverse events were reported in 43 (12%) patients receiving nivolumab and 39 (11%) patients receiving sorafenib. Four deaths in the nivolumab group and one death in the sorafenib group were assessed as treatment related. INTERPRETATION: First-line nivolumab treatment did not significantly improve overall survival compared with sorafenib, but clinical activity and a favourable safety profile were observed in patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma. Thus, nivolumab might be considered a therapeutic option for patients in whom tyrosine kinase inhibitors and antiangiogenic drugs are contraindicated or have substantial risks.

We aimed to assess the efficacy and safety of regorafenib in patients with HCC who have progressed during sorafenib treatment. METHODS: In this randomised, double-blind, parallel-group, phase 3 trial done at 152 sites in 21 countries, adults with HCC who tolerated sorafenib (≥400 mg/day for ≥20 of last 28 days of treatment), progressed on sorafenib, and had Child-Pugh A liver function were enrolled. Participants were randomly assigned (2:1) by a computer-generated randomisation list and interactive voice response system and stratified by geographical region, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status, macrovascular invasion, extrahepatic disease, and α-fetoprotein level to best supportive care plus oral regorafenib 160 mg or placebo once daily during weeks 1-3 of each 4-week cycle. Investigators, patients, and the funder were masked to treatment assignment. The primary endpoint was overall survival (defined as time from randomisation to death due to any cause) and analysed by intention to treat. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01774344. FINDINGS: Between May 14, 2013, and Dec 31, 2015, 843 patients were screened, of whom 573 were enrolled and randomised (379 to regorafenib and 194 to placebo; population for efficacy analyses), and 567 initiated treatment (374 received regorafenib and 193 received placebo; population for safety analyses). Regorafenib improved overall survival with a hazard ratio of 0·63 (95% CI 0·50-0·79; one-sided p<0·0001); median survival was 10·6 months (95% CI 9·1-12·1) for regorafenib versus 7·8 months (6·3-8·8) for placebo. Adverse events were reported in all regorafenib recipients (374 [100%] of 374) and 179 (93%) of 193 placebo recipients. The most common clinically relevant grade 3 or 4 treatment-emergent events were hypertension (57 patients [15%] in the regorafenib group vs nine patients [5%] in the placebo group), hand-foot skin reaction (47 patients [13%] vs one [1%]), fatigue (34 patients [9%] vs nine patients [5%]), and diarrhoea (12 patients [3%] vs no patients). Of the 88 deaths (grade 5 adverse events) reported during the study (50 patients [13%] assigned to regorafenib and 38 [20%] assigned to placebo), seven (2%) were considered by the investigator to be related to study drug in the regorafenib group and two (1%) in the placebo group, including two patients (1%) with hepatic failure in the placebo group. INTERPRETATION: Regorafenib is the only systemic treatment shown to provide survival benefit in HCC patients progressing on sorafenib treatment.

Patients with hepatocellular carcinoma have a poor prognosis and a substantial unmet clinical need. The phase 2-3 ORIENT-32 study aimed to assess sintilimab (a PD-1 inhibitor) plus IBI305, a bevacizumab biosimilar, versus sorafenib as a first-line treatment for unresectable HBV-associated hepatocellular carcinoma. METHODS: This randomised, open-label, phase 2-3 study was done at 50 clinical sites in China. Patients aged 18 years or older with histologically or cytologically diagnosed or clinically confirmed unresectable or metastatic hepatocellular carcinoma, no previous systemic treatment, and a baseline Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0 or 1 were eligible for inclusion. In the phase 2 part of the study, patients received intravenous sintilimab (200 mg every 3 weeks) plus intravenous IBI305 (15 mg/kg every 3 weeks). In the phase 3 part, patients were randomly assigned (2:1) to receive either sintilimab plus IBI305 (sintilimab-bevacizumab biosimilar group) or sorafenib (400 mg orally twice daily; sorafenib group), until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Randomisation was done using permuted block randomisation, with a block size of six, via an interactive web response system, and stratified by macrovascular invasion or extrahepatic metastasis, baseline α-fetoprotein, and ECOG performance status. The primary endpoint of the phase 2 part of the study was safety, assessed in all patients who received at least one dose of study drug. The co-primary endpoints of the phase 3 part of the study were overall survival and independent radiological review committee (IRRC)-assessed progression-free survival according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) version 1.1 in the intention-to-treat population. The study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03794440. The study is closed to new participants and follow-up is ongoing for long-term outcomes. FINDINGS: Between Feb 11, 2019 and Jan 15, 2020, we enrolled 595 patients: 24 were enrolled directly into the phase 2 safety run-in and 571 were randomly assigned to sintilimab-bevacizumab biosimilar (n=380) or sorafenib (n=191). In the phase 2 part of the trial, 24 patients received at least one dose of the study drug, with an objective response rate of 25·0% (95% CI 9·8-46·7). Based on the preliminary safety and activity data of the phase 2 part, in which grade 3 or worse treatment-related adverse events occurred in seven (29%) of 24 patients, the randomised phase 3 part was started. At data cutoff (Aug 15, 2020), the median follow-up was 10·0 months (IQR 8·5-11·7) in the sintilimab-bevacizumab biosimilar group and 10·0 months (8·4-11·7) in the sorafenib group. Patients in the sintilimab-bevacizumab biosimilar group had a significantly longer IRRC-assessed median progression-free survival (4·6 months [95% CI 4·1-5·7]) than did patients in the sorafenib group (2·8 months [2·7-3·2]; stratified hazard ratio [HR] 0·56, 95% CI 0·46-0·70; p<0·0001). In the first interim analysis of overall survival, sintilimab-bevacizumab biosimilar showed a significantly longer overall survival than did sorafenib (median not reached [95% CI not reached-not reached] vs 10·4 months [8·5-not reached]; HR 0·57, 95% CI 0·43-0·75; p<0·0001). The most common grade 3-4 treatment-emergent adverse events were hypertension (55 [14%] of 380 patients in the sintilimab-bevacizumab biosimilar group vs 11 [6%] of 185 patients in the sorafenib group) and palmar-plantar erythrodysaesthesia syndrome (none vs 22 [12%]). 123 (32%) patients in the sintilimab-bevacizumab biosimilar group and 36 (19%) patients in the sorafenib group had serious adverse events. Treatment-related adverse events that led to death occurred in six (2%) patients in the sintilimab-bevacizumab biosimilar group (one patient with abnormal liver function, one patient with both hepatic failure and gastrointestinal haemorrhage, one patient with interstitial lung disease, one patient with both hepatic faliure and hyperkalemia, one patient with upper gastrointestinal haemorrhage, and one patient with intestinal volvulus) and two (1%) patients in the sorafenib group (one patient with gastrointestinal haemorrhage and one patient with death of unknown cause). INTERPRETATION: Sintilimab plus IBI305 showed a significant overall survival and progression-free survival benefit versus sorafenib in the first-line setting for Chinese patients with unresectable, HBV-associated hepatocellular carcinoma, with an acceptable safety profile.

14,Efficacy and Safety of Nivolumab Plus Ipilimumab in Patients With Advanced Hepatocellular Carcinoma Previously Treated With Sorafenib: The CheckMate 040 Randomized Clinical Trial.,10.1001/jamaoncol.2020.4564,"IMPORTANCE: Most patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) are diagnosed with advanced disease not eligible for potentially curative therapies; therefore, new treatment options are needed. Combining nivolumab with ipilimumab may improve clinical outcomes compared with nivolumab monotherapy. OBJECTIVE: To assess efficacy and safety of nivolumab plus ipilimumab in patients with advanced HCC who were previously treated with sorafenib. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: CheckMate 040 is a multicenter, open-label, multicohort, phase 1/2 study. In the nivolumab plus ipilimumab cohort, patients were randomized between January 4 and September 26, 2016. Treatment group information was blinded after randomization. Median follow-up was 30.7 months. Data cutoff for this analysis was January 2019. Patients were recruited at 31 centers in 10 countries/territories in Asia, Europe, and North America. Eligible patients had advanced HCC (with/without hepatitis B or C) previously treated with sorafenib. A total of 148 patients were randomized (50 to arm A and 49 each to arms B and C). INTERVENTIONS: Patients were randomized 1:1:1 to either nivolumab 1 mg/kg plus ipilimumab 3 mg/kg, administered every 3 weeks (4 doses), followed by nivolumab 240 mg every 2 weeks (arm A); nivolumab 3 mg/kg plus ipilimumab 1 mg/kg, administered every 3 weeks (4 doses), followed by nivolumab 240 mg every 2 weeks (arm B); or nivolumab 3 mg/kg every 2 weeks plus ipilimumab 1 mg/kg every 6 weeks (arm C). MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Coprimary end points were safety, tolerability, and objective response rate. Duration of response was also measured (investigator assessed with the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors v1.1). RESULTS: Of 148 total participants, 120 were male (81%). Median (IQR) age was 60 (52.5-66.5). At data cutoff (January 2019), the median follow-up was 30.7 months (IQR, 29.9-34.7). Investigator-assessed objective response rate was 32% (95% CI, 20%-47%) in arm A, 27% (95% CI, 15%-41%) in arm B, and 29% (95% CI, 17%-43%) in arm C. Median (range) duration of response was not reached (8.3-33.7+) in arm A and was 15.2 months (4.2-29.9+) in arm B and 21.7 months (2.8-32.7+) in arm C. Any-grade treatment-related adverse events were reported in 46 of 49 patients (94%) in arm A, 35 of 49 patients (71%) in arm B, and 38 of 48 patients (79%) in arm C; there was 1 treatment-related death (arm A; grade 5 pneumonitis). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this randomized clinical trial, nivolumab plus ipilimumab had manageable safety, promising objective response rate, and durable responses. The arm A regimen (4 doses nivolumab 1 mg/kg plus ipilimumab 3 mg/kg every 3 weeks then nivolumab 240 mg every 2 weeks) received accelerated approval in the US based on the results of this study.

15,Tislelizumab vs Sorafenib as First-Line Treatment for Unresectable Hepatocellular Carcinoma: A Phase 3 Randomized Clinical Trial.,10.1001/jamaoncol.2023.4003,"IMPORTANCE: Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a leading cause of cancer-related mortality, and additional first-line treatments are needed. The programmed cell death protein 1 inhibitor tislelizumab demonstrated efficacy and a tolerable safety profile as second-line HCC treatment. OBJECTIVE: To investigate efficacy and safety of tislelizumab vs sorafenib tosylate for first-line treatment of unresectable HCC. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: The open-label, global, multiregional phase 3 RATIONALE-301 randomized clinical trial enrolled systemic therapy-naive adults with histologically confirmed HCC, Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer stage B or C disease, disease progression following (or patient was not amenable to) locoregional therapy, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 1 or less, and Child-Pugh class A, between December 27, 2017, and October 2, 2019. Data cutoff was July 11, 2022. INTERVENTION: Patients were randomized 1:1 to receive tislelizumab, 200 mg intravenously every 3 weeks, or sorafenib tosylate, 400 mg orally twice daily. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary end point was overall survival (OS); secondary end points included objective response rate, progression-free survival, duration of response, and safety. RESULTS: A total of 674 patients were included in the analysis (570 men [84.6%]; median age, 61 years [range, 23-86 years]). As of July 11, 2022, minimum study follow-up was 33 months. The primary end point of OS noninferiority of tislelizumab vs sorafenib was met in the intention-to-treat population (n = 674); median overall survival was 15.9 (95% CI, 13.2-19.7) months vs 14.1 (95% CI, 12.6-17.4) months, respectively (hazard ratio [HR], 0.85 [95.003% CI, 0.71-1.02]), and superiority of tislelizumab vs sorafenib was not met. The objective response rate was 14.3% (n = 49) for tislelizumab vs 5.4% (n = 18) for sorafenib, and median duration of response was 36.1 (95% CI, 16.8 to not evaluable) months vs 11.0 (95% CI, 6.2-14.7) months, respectively. Median progression-free survival was 2.1 (95% CI, 2.1-3.5) months vs 3.4 (95% CI, 2.2-4.1) months with tislelizumab vs sorafenib (HR, 1.11 [95% CI, 0.92-1.33]). The incidence of treatment-emergent adverse events (AEs) was 96.2% (325 of 338 patients) for tislelizumab and 100% (n = 324) for sorafenib. Grade 3 or greater treatment-related AEs were reported in 75 patients (22.2%) receiving tislelizumab and 173 (53.4%) receiving sorafenib. There was a lower incidence of treatment-related AEs leading to drug discontinuation (21 [6.2%] vs 33 [10.2%]) and drug modification (68 [20.1%] vs 187 [57.7%]) with tislelizumab vs sorafenib. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In RATIONALE-301, tislelizumab demonstrated OS benefit that was noninferior vs sorafenib, with a higher objective response rate and more durable responses, while median progression-free survival was longer with sorafenib.

We aimed to compare the overall survival of patients treated with FOLFOX-HAIC versus TACE as first-line treatment in this population. METHODS: In this randomized, multicenter, open-label trial, adults with unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (largest diameter ≥ 7 cm) without macrovascular invasion or extrahepatic spread were randomly assigned 1:1 to FOLFOX-HAIC (oxaliplatin 130 mg/m(2), leucovorin 400 mg/m(2), fluorouracil bolus 400 mg/m(2) on day 1, and fluorouracil infusion 2,400 mg/m(2) for 24 hours, once every 3 weeks) or TACE (epirubicin 50 mg, lobaplatin 50 mg, and lipiodol and polyvinyl alcohol particles). The primary end point was overall survival by intention-to-treat analysis. Safety was assessed in patients who received ≥ 1 cycle of study treatment. RESULTS: Between October 1, 2016, and November 23, 2018, 315 patients were randomly assigned to FOLFOX-HAIC (n = 159) or TACE (n = 156).

18,REFLECT-a phase 3 trial comparing efficacy and safety of lenvatinib to sorafenib for the treatment of unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma: an analysis of Japanese subset.,10.1007/s00535-019-01642-1,"BACKGROUND: A phase 3, multinational, randomized, non-inferiority trial (REFLECT) compared the efficacy and safety of lenvatinib (LEN) and sorafenib (SOR) in patients with unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (uHCC). LEN had an effect on overall survival (OS) compared to SOR, statistically confirmed by non-inferiority [OS: median = 13.6 months vs. 12.3 months; hazard ratio (HR) 0.92, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.79-1.06], and demonstrated statistically significant improvements in progression-free survival (PFS) and the objective response rate (ORR) in the overall population. The results of a subset analysis that evaluated the efficacy and safety of LEN and SOR in the Japanese population are reported. METHODS: The intent-to-treat population enrolled in Japan was analyzed. RESULTS: Of 954 patients in the overall population, 168 Japanese patients were assigned to the LEN arm (N = 81) or the SOR arm (N = 87). Median OS was 17.6 months for LEN vs. 17.8 months for SOR (HR 0.90; 95% CI 0.62-1.29). LEN showed statistically significant improvements over SOR in PFS (7.2 months vs. 4.6 months) and ORR (29.6% vs. 6.9%). The relative dose intensity of LEN and SOR in the Japanese population was lower than in the overall population. Frequently observed, related adverse events included palmar-plantar erythrodysaesthesia syndrome (PPES), hypertension, decreased appetite, and proteinuria in the LEN arm, and PPES, hypertension, diarrhea, and alopecia in the SOR arm. CONCLUSIONS: The efficacy and safety of LEN in the Japanese population were similar to those in the overall population of REFLECT.

19,"Liver transplantation in hepatocellular carcinoma after tumour downstaging (XXL): a randomised, controlled, phase 2b/3 trial.",10.1016/S1470-2045(20)30224-2,"BACKGROUND: Indications for liver transplantation for hepatocellular carcinoma are evolving and so-called expanded criteria remain debated. Locoregional therapies are able to downstage hepatocellular carcinoma from beyond to within the Milan criteria. We aimed to investigate the efficacy of liver transplantation after successful hepatocellular carcinoma downstaging. METHODS: We did an open-label, multicentre, randomised, controlled trial designed in two phases, 2b and 3, at nine Italian tertiary care and transplantation centres. Patients aged 18-65 years with hepatocellular carcinoma beyond the Milan criteria, absence of macrovascular invasion or extrahepatic spread, 5-year estimated post-transplantation survival of at least 50%, and good liver function (Child-Pugh A-B7) were recruited and underwent tumour downstaging with locoregional, surgical, or systemic therapies according to multidisciplinary decision. After an observation period of 3 months, during which sorafenib was allowed, patients with partial or complete responses according to modified Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors were randomly assigned (1:1) by an interactive web-response system to liver transplantation or non-transplantation therapies (control group). A block randomisation (block size of 2), stratified by centre and compliance to sorafenib treatment, was applied. Liver transplantation was done with whole or split organs procured from brain-dead donors. The control group received sequences of locoregional and systemic treatment at the time of demonstrated tumour progression. The primary outcomes were 5-year tumour event-free survival for phase 2b and overall survival for phase 3. Analyses were by intention to treat. Organ allocation policy changed during the course of the study and restricted patient accrual to 4 years. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT01387503. FINDINGS: Between March 1, 2011, and March 31, 2015, 74 patients were enrolled. Median duration of downstaging was 6 months (IQR 4-11). 29 patients dropped out before randomisation and 45 were randomly assigned: 23 to the transplantation group versus 22 to the control group. At data cutoff on July 31, 2019, median follow-up was 71 months (IQR 60-85). 5-year tumour event-free survival was 76·8% (95% CI 60·8-96·9) in the transplantation group versus 18·3% (7·1-47·0) in the control group (hazard ratio [HR] 0·20, 95% CI 0·07-0·57; p=0·003). 5-year overall survival was 77·5% (95% CI 61·9-97·1) in the transplantation group versus 31·2% (16·6-58·5) in the control group (HR 0·32, 95% CI 0·11-0·92; p=0·035). The most common registered grade 3-4 serious adverse events were hepatitis C virus recurrence (three [13%] of 23 patients) and acute transplant rejection (two [9%]) in the transplantation group, and post-embolisation syndrome (two [9%] of 22 patients) in the control group. Treatment-related deaths occurred in four patients: two (8%) of 23 patients in the transplantation group (myocardial infarction and multi-organ failure) versus two (9%) of 22 patients in the control group (liver decompensation). INTERPRETATION: Although results must be interpreted with caution owing to the early closing of the trial, after effective and sustained downstaging of eligible hepatocellular carcinomas beyond the Milan criteria, liver transplantation improved tumour event-free survival and overall survival compared with non-transplantation therapies Post-downstaging tumour response could contribute to the expansion of hepatocellular carcinoma transplantation criteria.

20,Systemic Therapy for Advanced Hepatocellular Carcinoma: ASCO Guideline.,10.1200/JCO.20.02672,"PURPOSE: To develop an evidence-based clinical practice guideline to assist in clinical decision making for patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). METHODS: ASCO convened an Expert Panel to conduct a systematic review of published phase III randomized controlled trials (2007-2020) on systemic therapy for advanced HCC and provide recommended care options for this patient population. RESULTS: Nine phase III randomized controlled trials met the inclusion criteria. RECOMMENDATIONS: Atezolizumab + bevacizumab (atezo + bev) may be offered as first-line treatment of most patients with advanced HCC, Child-Pugh class A liver disease, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group Performance Status (ECOG PS) 0-1, and following management of esophageal varices, when present, according to institutional guidelines. Where there are contraindications to atezolizumab and/or bevacizumab, tyrosine kinase inhibitors sorafenib or lenvatinib may be offered as first-line treatment of patients with advanced HCC, Child-Pugh class A liver disease, and ECOG PS 0-1. Following first-line treatment with atezo + bev, and until better data are available, second-line therapy with a tyrosine kinase inhibitor may be recommended for appropriate candidates. Following first-line therapy with sorafenib or lenvatinib, second-line therapy options for appropriate candidates include cabozantinib, regorafenib for patients who previously tolerated sorafenib, or ramucirumab (for patients with α-fetoprotein ≥ 400 ng/mL), or atezo + bev where patients did not have access to this option as first-line therapy. Pembrolizumab or nivolumab are also reasonable options for appropriate patients following sorafenib or lenvatinib.

We conducted a retrospective multi-centre study to compare the clinical efficacy and safety of lenvatinib and atezolizumab with bevacizumab as a first-line treatment for patients with unresectable HCC in the real-world scenario. METHODS: Clinical features of lenvatinib and atezolizumab plus bevacizumab patients were balanced through inverse probability of treatment weighting (IPTW) methodology, which weights patients' characteristics and measured outcomes of each patient in both treatment arms. Overall survival (OS) was the primary end-point. RESULTS: The analysis included 1341 patients who received lenvatinib, and 864 patients who received atezolizumab plus bevacizumab. After IPTW adjustment, atezolizumab plus bevacizumab did not show a survival advantage over lenvatinib HR 0.97 (p = 0.739). OS was prolonged by atezolizumab plus bevacizumab over lenvatinib in viral patients (HR: 0.76; p = 0.024). Conversely, OS was prolonged by lenvatinib in patients with non-alcoholic steatohepatitis/non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (HR: 1.88; p = 0.014).

The COSMIC-312 trial assessed cabozantinib plus atezolizumab versus sorafenib as first-line systemic treatment for advanced hepatocellular carcinoma. METHODS: COSMIC-312 is an open-label, randomised, phase 3 trial that enrolled patients aged 18 years or older with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma not amenable to curative or locoregional therapy and previously untreated with systemic anticancer therapy at 178 centres in 32 countries. Patients with fibrolamellar carcinoma, sarcomatoid hepatocellular carcinoma, or combined hepatocellular cholangiocarcinoma were not eligible. Tumours involving major blood vessels, including the main portal vein, were permitted. Patients were required to have measurable disease per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors version 1.1 (RECIST 1.1), Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer stage B or C disease, an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0 or 1, adequate organ and marrow function, and Child-Pugh class A. Previous resection, tumour ablation, radiotherapy, or arterial chemotherapy was allowed if more than 28 days before randomisation. Patients were randomly assigned (2:1:1) via a web-based interactive response system to cabozantinib 40 mg orally once daily plus atezolizumab 1200 mg intravenously every 3 weeks, sorafenib 400 mg orally twice daily, or single-agent cabozantinib 60 mg orally once daily. Randomisation was stratified by disease aetiology, geographical region, and presence of extrahepatic disease or macrovascular invasion. Dual primary endpoints were progression-free survival per RECIST 1.1 as assessed by a blinded independent radiology committee in the first 372 patients randomly assigned to the combination treatment of cabozantinib plus atezolizumab or sorafenib (progression-free survival intention-to-treat [ITT] population), and overall survival in all patients randomly assigned to cabozantinib plus atezolizumab or sorafenib (ITT population). Final progression-free survival and concurrent interim overall survival analyses are presented. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03755791. FINDINGS: Analyses at data cut-off (March 8, 2021) included the first 837 patients randomly assigned between Dec 7, 2018, and Aug 27, 2020, to combination treatment of cabozantinib plus atezolizumab (n=432), sorafenib (n=217), or single-agent cabozantinib (n=188).

Median progression-free survival was 6·8 months (99% CI 5·6-8·3) in the combination treatment group versus 4·2 months (2·8-7·0) in the sorafenib group (hazard ratio [HR] 0·63, 99% CI 0·44-0·91, p=0·0012). Median overall survival (interim analysis) was 15·4 months (96% CI 13·7-17·7) in the combination treatment group versus 15·5 months (12·1-not estimable) in the sorafenib group (HR 0·90, 96% CI 0·69-1·18; p=0·44). The most common grade 3 or 4 adverse events were alanine aminotransferase increase (38 [9%] of 429 patients in the combination treatment group vs six [3%] of 207 in the sorafenib group vs 12 [6%] of 188 in the single-agent cabozantinib group), hypertension (37 [9%] vs 17 [8%] vs 23 [12%]), aspartate aminotransferase increase (37 [9%] vs eight [4%] vs 18 [10%]), and palmar-plantar erythrodysaesthesia (35 [8%] vs 17 [8%] vs 16 [9%]); serious treatment-related adverse events occurred in 78 (18%) patients in the combination treatment group, 16 (8%) patients in the sorafenib group, and 24 (13%) in the single-agent cabozantinib group. Treatment-related grade 5 events occurred in six (1%) patients in the combination treatment group (encephalopathy, hepatic failure, drug-induced liver injury, oesophageal varices haemorrhage, multiple organ dysfunction syndrome, and tumour lysis syndrome), one (<1%) patient in the sorafenib group (general physical health deterioration), and one (<1%) patient in the single-agent cabozantinib group (gastrointestinal haemorrhage). INTERPRETATION: Cabozantinib plus atezolizumab might be a treatment option for select patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma, but additional studies are needed.

Sorafenib plus hepatic arterial infusion chemotherapy (HAIC) of oxaliplatin, fluorouracil, and leucovorin (FOLFOX) has shown promising results for these patients in a previous phase 2 study. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the efficacy and safety of sorafenib plus HAIC compared with sorafenib for hepatocellular carcinoma with portal vein invasion. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This randomized, open-label clinical trial enrolled 818 screened patients. Of the 818 participants, 247 with hepatocellular carcinoma and portal vein invasion were randomly assigned (1:1) via a computer-generated sequence to receive sorafenib plus HAIC or sorafenib. This trial was conducted at 5 hospitals in China and enrolled patients from April 1, 2016, to October 10, 2017, with a follow-up period of 10 months. INTERVENTIONS: Randomization to receive 400 mg sorafenib twice daily (sorafenib group) or 400 mg sorafenib twice daily plus HAIC (SoraHAIC group) (oxaliplatin 85 mg/m2, leucovorin 400 mg/m2, fluorouracil bolus 400 mg/m2 on day 1, and fluorouracil infusion 2400 mg/m2 for 46 hours, every 3 weeks). MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary endpoint was overall survival by intention-to-treat analysis. Safety was assessed in patients who received at least 1 dose of study treatment. RESULTS: For 247 patients (median age, 49 years; range, 18-75 years; 223 men and 24 women), median overall survival was 13.37 months (95% CI, 10.27-16.46) in the SoraHAIC group vs 7.13 months (95% CI, 6.28-7.98) in the sorafenib group (hazard ratio [HR], 0.35; 95% CI, 0.26-0.48; P < .001). The SoraHAIC group showed a higher response rate than the sorafenib group (51 [40.8%] vs 3 [2.46%]; P < .001), and a longer median progression-free survival (7.03 [95% CI, 6.05-8.02] vs 2.6 [95% CI, 2.15-3.05] months; P < .001). Grade 3/4 adverse events that were more frequent in the SoraHAIC group than in the sorafenib group included neutropenia (12 [9.68%] vs 3 [2.48%]), thrombocytopenia (16 [12.9%] vs 6 [4.96%]), and vomiting (8 [6.45%] vs 1 [0.83%]).

24,"Ramucirumab after sorafenib in patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma and increased α-fetoprotein concentrations (REACH-2): a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 3 trial.",10.1016/S1470-2045(18)30937-9,"BACKGROUND: Patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma and increased α-fetoprotein concentrations have poor prognosis. We aimed to establish the efficacy of ramucirumab in patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma and α-fetoprotein concentrations of 400 ng/mL or higher. METHODS: REACH-2 was a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 3 trial done at 92 hospitals, clinics, and medical centres in 20 countries. Eligible patients were aged 18 years or older and had histologically or cytologically confirmed hepatocellular carcinoma, or diagnosed cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma, Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer stage B or C disease, Child-Pugh class A liver disease, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance statuses of 0 or 1, α-fetoprotein concentrations of 400 ng/mL or greater, and had previously received first-line sorafenib. Participants were randomly assigned (2:1) via an interactive web response system with a computer-generated random sequence to 8 mg/kg intravenous ramucirumab every 2 weeks or placebo. All patients received best supportive care. The primary endpoint was overall survival. Secondary endpoints were progression-free survival, proportion of patients achieving an objective response, time to radiographic progression, safety, time to deterioration in scores on the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy Hepatobiliary Symptom Index 8 (FHSI-8), and time to deterioration in ECOG performance status. We also pooled individual patient data from REACH-2 with data from REACH (NCT01140347) for patients with α-fetoprotein concentrations of 400 ng/mL or greater. Efficacy analyses were by intention to treat, whereas safety analyses were done in all patients who received at least one dose of study drug. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02435433. FINDINGS: Between July 26, 2015, and Aug 30, 2017, 292 patients were randomly assigned, 197 to the ramucirumab group and 95 to the placebo group. At a median follow-up of 7·6 months (IQR 4·0-12·5), median overall survival (8·5 months [95% CI 7·0-10·6] vs 7·3 months [5·4-9·1]; hazard ratio [HR] 0·710 [95% CI 0·531-0·949]; p=0·0199) and progression-free survival (2·8 months [2·8-4·1] vs 1·6 months [1·5-2·7]; 0·452 [0·339-0·603]; p<0·0001) were significantly improved in the ramucirumab group compared with the placebo group. The proportion of patients with an objective response did not differ significantly between groups (nine [5%] of 197 vs one [1%] of 95; p=0·1697). Median time to deterioration in FHSI-8 total scores (3·7 months [95% CI 2·8-4·4] vs 2·8 months [1·6-2·9]; HR 0·799 [95% CI 0·545-1·171]; p=0·238) and ECOG performance statuses (HR 1·082 [95% CI 0·639-1·832]; p=0·77) did not differ between groups. Grade 3 or worse treatment-emergent adverse events that occurred in at least 5% of patients in either group were hypertension (25 [13%] in the ramucirumab group vs five [5%] in the placebo group), hyponatraemia (11 [6%] vs 0) and increased aspartate aminotransferase (six [3%] vs five [5%]). Serious adverse events of any grade and cause occurred in 68 (35%) patients in the ramucirumab group and 28 (29%) patients in the placebo group. Three patients in the ramucirumab group died from treatment-emergent adverse events that were judged to be related to study treatment (one had acute kidney injury, one had hepatorenal syndrome, and one had renal failure). INTERPRETATION: REACH-2 met its primary endpoint, showing improved overall survival for ramucirumab compared with placebo in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma and α-fetoprotein concentrations of at least 400 ng/mL who had previously received sorafenib. Ramucirumab was well tolerated, with a manageable safety profile.

Here, we report the efficacy and safety of combining toripalimab, lenvatinib, and gemcitabine plus oxaliplatin (GEMOX) as first-line therapy for advanced ICC. Thirty patients with pathologically confirmed advanced ICC received intravenous gemcitabine (1 g/m(2)) on Days 1 and 8 and oxaliplatin (85 mg/m(2)) Q3W for six cycles along with intravenous toripalimab (240 mg) Q3W and oral lenvatinib (8 mg) once daily for one year. The expression of programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) and genetic status was investigated in paraffin-embedded tissues using immunohistochemistry and whole-exome sequencing (WES) analysis. The primary endpoint was the objective response rate (ORR). Secondary outcomes included safety, overall survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS), disease control rate (DCR) and duration of response (DoR). As of July 1, 2022, the median follow-up time was 23.5 months, and the ORR was 80%. Twenty-three patients achieved partial response, and one achieved complete response. Patients (21/30) with DNA damage response (DDR)-related gene mutations showed a higher ORR, while patients (14/30) with tumor area positivity ≥1 (PD-L1 staining) showed a trend of high ORR, but without significant difference. The median OS, PFS, and DoR were 22.5, 10.2, and 11.0 months, respectively. The DCR was 93.3%. Further, 56.7% of patients experienced manageable grade ≥3 adverse events (AEs), commonly neutropenia (40.0%) and leukocytopenia (23.3%).

This study compared the efficacy and safety of donafenib versus sorafenib as first-line therapy for advanced HCC. PATIENTS AND METHODS: This open-label, randomized, parallel-controlled, multicenter phase II-III trial enrolled patients with unresectable or metastatic HCC, a Child-Pugh score ≤ 7, and no prior systemic therapy from 37 sites across China. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive oral donafenib (0.2 g) or sorafenib (0.4 g) twice daily until intolerable toxicity or disease progression. The primary end point was overall survival (OS), tested for noninferiority and superiority. Efficacy was primarily assessed in the full analysis set (FAS), and safety was assessed in all treated patients. RESULTS: Between March 21, 2016, and April 16, 2018, 668 patients (intention-to-treat) were randomly assigned to donafenib and sorafenib treatment arms; the FAS included 328 and 331 patients, respectively.

Lenvatinib, a multikinase inhibitor, and pembrolizumab, a PD-1 inhibitor, have shown efficacy and tolerability in patients with HCC, and adding this combination to TACE may enhance clinical benefit. PROTOCOL: LEAP-012 is a prospective, double-blind randomized phase 3 study. Adults with confirmed HCC localized to the liver without portal vein thrombosis and not amenable to curative treatment, ≥ 1 measurable tumor per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors 1.1 (RECIST 1.1), Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status 0 or 1, Child-Pugh class A and no previous systemic treatment for HCC are eligible. Patients will be randomly assigned to lenvatinib once daily plus pembrolizumab every 6 weeks plus TACE or placebos plus TACE. Dual primary endpoints are overall survival and progression-free survival per RECIST 1.1 by blinded independent central review (BICR). Secondary endpoints are progression-free survival, objective response rate, disease control rate, duration of response and time to progression per modified RECIST by BICR; objective response rate, disease control rate, duration of response and time to progression per RECIST 1.1 by BICR; and safety. STATISTICS: The planned sample size, 950 patients, was calculated to permit accumulation of sufficient overall survival events in 5 years to achieve 90% power for the overall survival primary endpoint.

DESIGN: Patients with unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) were randomised to TACE plus sorafenib (n=80) or TACE alone (n=76). Patients in the combination group received sorafenib 400 mg once daily for 2-3 weeks before TACE, followed by 800 mg once daily during on-demand conventional TACE sessions until time to untreatable (unTACEable) progression (TTUP), defined as untreatable tumour progression, transient deterioration to Child-Pugh C or appearance of vascular invasion/extrahepatic spread. Co-primary endpoints were progression-free survival (PFS), which is not a conventional one but defined as TTUP, or time to any cause of death plus overall survival (OS). Multiplicity was adjusted by gatekeeping hierarchical testing. RESULTS: Median PFS was significantly longer in the TACE plus sorafenib than in the TACE alone group (25.2 vs 13.5 months; p=0.006). OS was not analysed because only 73.6% of OS events were reached. Median TTUP (26.7 vs 20.6 months; p=0.02) was also significantly longer in the TACE plus sorafenib group. OS at 1 year and 2 years in TACE plus sorafenib group and TACE alone group were 96.2% and 82.7% and 77.2% and 64.6%, respectively. There were no unexpected toxicities. CONCLUSION: TACE plus sorafenib significantly improved PFS over TACE alone in patients with unresectable HCC. Adverse events were consistent with those of previous TACE combination trials.

METHODS: In a double-blind, phase III trial, 453 patients with advanced HCC and progression during or after treatment with or intolerance to sorafenib or oxaliplatin-based chemotherapy were randomly assigned in a 2:1 ratio to receive pembrolizumab (200 mg) or placebo once every 3 weeks for ≤ 35 cycles plus best supportive care. The primary end point was overall survival (one-sided significance threshold, P = .0193 [final analysis]). Secondary end points included progression-free survival (PFS) and objective response rate (ORR; one-sided significance threshold, P = .0134 and .0091, respectively [second interim analysis]; RECIST version 1.1, by blinded independent central review). RESULTS: Median overall survival was longer in the pembrolizumab group than in the placebo group (14.6 v 13.0 months; hazard ratio for death, 0.79; 95% CI, 0.63 to 0.99; P = .0180).

32,(90)Y Radioembolization versus Drug-eluting Bead Chemoembolization for Unresectable Hepatocellular Carcinoma: Results from the TRACE Phase II Randomized Controlled Trial.,10.1148/radiol.211806,"Background Transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) is the recommended treatment for intermediate hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) according to the Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer guidelines. Prospective uncontrolled studies suggest that yttrium 90 ((90)Y) transarterial radioembolization (TARE) is a safe and effective alternative. Purpose To compare the efficacy and safety of TARE with TACE for unresectable HCC. Materials and Methods In this single-center prospective randomized controlled trial (TRACE), (90)Y glass TARE was compared with doxorubicin drug-eluting bead (DEB) TACE in participants with intermediate-stage HCC, extended to Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status 1 and those with early-stage HCC not eligible for surgery or thermoablation. Participants were recruited between September 2011 and March 2018. The primary end point was time to overall tumor progression (TTP) (Kaplan-Meier analysis) in the intention-to-treat (ITT) and per-protocol (PP) groups. Results At interim analysis, 38 participants (median age, 67 years; IQR, 63-72 years; 33 men) were randomized to the TARE arm and 34 (median age, 68 years; IQR, 61-71 years; 30 men) to the DEB-TACE arm (ITT group). Median TTP was 17.1 months in the TARE arm versus 9.5 months in the DEB-TACE arm (ITT group hazard ratio [HR], 0.36; 95% CI: 0.18, 0.70; P = .002) (PP group, 32 and 34 participants, respectively, in each arm; HR, 0.29; 95% CI: 0.14, 0.60; P < .001). Median overall survival was 30.2 months after TARE and 15.6 months after DEB-TACE (ITT group HR, 0.48; 95% CI: 0.28, 0.82; P = .006). Serious adverse events grade 3 or higher (13 of 33 participants [39%] vs 19 of 36 [53%] after TARE and DEB-TACE, respectively; P = .47) and 30-day mortality (0 of 33 participants [0%] vs three of 36 [8.3%]; P = .24) were similar in the safety groups. At the interim, the HR for the primary end point, TTP, was less than 0.39, meeting the criteria to halt the study.

33,Single-cell immune signature for detecting early-stage HCC and early assessing anti-PD-1 immunotherapy efficacy.,10.1136/jitc-2021-003133,"BACKGROUND: The early diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) can greatly improve patients' 5-year survival rate, and the early efficacy assessment is important for oncologists to harness the anti-programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) immunotherapy in patients with advanced HCC. The lack of effective predicting biomarkers not only leads to delayed detection of the disease but also results in ineffective immunotherapy and limited clinical survival benefit. METHODS: We exploited the single-cell approach (cytometry by time of flight (CyTOF)) to analyze peripheral blood mononuclear cells from multicohorts of human samples. Immune signatures for different stages of patients with HCC were systematically profiled and statistically compared. Furthermore, the dynamic changes of peripheral immune compositions for both first-line and second-line patients with HCC after anti-PD-1 monotherapy were also evaluated and systematically compared. RESULTS: We identified stage-specific immune signatures for HCC and constructed a logistic AdaBoost-SVM classifier based on these signatures. The classifier provided superior performance in predicting early-stage HCC over the commonly used serum alpha-fetoprotein level. We also revealed the treatment stage-specific immune signatures from peripheral blood and their dynamical changing patterns, all of which were integrated to achieve early discrimination of patients with non-durable benefit for both first-line and second-line anti-PD-1 monotherapies. CONCLUSIONS: Our newly identified single-cell peripheral immune signatures provide promising non-invasive biomarkers for early detection of HCC and early assessment for anti-PD-1 immunotherapy efficacy in patients with advanced HCC. These new findings can potentially facilitate early diagnosis and novel immunotherapy for patients with HCC in future practice and further guide the utility of CyTOF in clinical translation of cancer research.

34,Sorafenib Plus Hepatic Arterial Infusion Chemotherapy versus Sorafenib for Hepatocellular Carcinoma with Major Portal Vein Tumor Thrombosis: A Randomized Trial.,10.1148/radiol.211545,"Background The prognosis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) with major portal vein tumor thrombosis (PVTT) is dismal after standard treatment with sorafenib. Hepatic arterial infusion chemotherapy (HAIC) has been suggested for patients with HCC and major PVTT. Purpose To compare the efficacy and safety of sorafenib plus 3cir-OFF HAIC versus sorafenib alone for advanced HCC with major PVTT. Materials and Methods This phase II trial recruited systemic treatment-naïve patients with HCC and major PVTT (portal vein invasion grade Vp3 [first branch] and Vp4 [main trunk]) between June 2017 and November 2019. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1 ratio) to receive sorafenib (400 mg twice daily) plus 3cir-OFF HAIC (35 mg/m(2) oxaliplatin [hours 0-2] followed by 600 mg/m(2) 5-fluorouracil [hours 2-24], days 1-3) with a standardized percutaneous port catheter system or sorafenib alone (400 mg twice daily) every 4 weeks. The primary end point was overall survival (OS). The secondary end points were objective response rate, progression-free survival (PFS), and safety. OS and PFS were assessed using the Kaplan-Meier method and log-rank test. Results The intent-to-treat population included 64 patients, with 32 in each group. The median OS was 16.3 months (95% CI: 0.0, 35.5) with sorafenib plus HAIC and 6.5 months (95% CI: 4.4, 8.6) with sorafenib alone (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.28; 95% CI: 0.15, 0.53; P < .001). A higher objective response rate (41% [n = 13] vs 3% [n = 1], P < .001) and a longer median PFS (9.0 months vs 2.5 months; HR = 0.26; 95% CI: 0.15, 0.47; P < .001) were observed in the sorafenib plus HAIC group. Grade 3 or 4 adverse events were more frequent in the sorafenib plus HAIC group, including diarrhea (n = 7 [22%] vs n = 5 [16%]), hand-foot syndrome (n = 6 [19%] vs n = 2 [6%]), and thrombocytopenia (n = 7 [22%] vs n = 0).

35,Overall survival and objective response in advanced unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma: A subanalysis of the REFLECT study.,10.1016/j.jhep.2022.09.006,"BACKGROUND & AIMS: Validated surrogate endpoints for overall survival (OS) are important for expediting the clinical study and drug-development processes. Herein, we aimed to validate objective response as an independent predictor of OS in individuals with unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) receiving systemic anti-angiogenic therapy. METHODS: We investigated the association between objective response (investigator-assessed mRECIST, independent radiologic review [IRR] mRECIST and RECIST v1.1) and OS in REFLECT, a phase III study of lenvatinib vs. sorafenib. We conducted landmark analyses (Simon-Makuch) of OS by objective response at 2, 4, and 6 months after randomization. RESULTS: Median OS was 21.6 months (95% CI 18.6-24.5) for responders (investigator-assessed mRECIST) vs. 11.9 months (95% CI 10.7-12.8) for non-responders (hazard ratio [HR] 0.61; 95% CI 0.49-0.76; p <0.001). Objective response by IRR per mRECIST and RECIST v1.1 supported the association with OS (HR 0.61; 95% CI 0.51-0.72; p <0.001 and HR 0.50; 95% CI 0.39-0.65; p <0.001, respectively). OS was significantly prolonged for responders vs. non-responders (investigator-assessed mRECIST) at the 2-month (HR 0.61; 95% CI 0.49-0.76; p <0.001), 4-month (HR 0.63; 95% CI 0.51-0.80; p <0.001), and 6-month (HR 0.68; 95% CI 0.54-0.86; p <0.001) landmarks. Results were similar when assessed by IRR, with both mRECIST and RECIST v1.1. An exploratory multivariate Cox regression analysis identified objective response by investigator-assessed mRECIST (HR 0.55; 95% CI 0.44-0.68; p <0.0001) and IRR-assessed RECIST v1.1 (HR 0.49; 95% CI, 0.38-0.64; p <0.0001) as independent predictors of OS in individuals with unresectable HCC. CONCLUSIONS: Objective response was an independent predictor of OS in individuals with unresectable HCC in REFLECT; additional studies are needed to confirm surrogacy. Participants achieving a complete or partial response by mRECIST or RECIST v1.1 had significantly longer survival vs. those with stable/progressive/non-evaluable disease. GOV NUMBER: NCT01761266. IMPACT AND IMPLICATIONS: This analysis of data taken from a completed clinical trial (REFLECT) looked for any link between objective response and overall survival time in individuals with unresectable HCC receiving anti-angiogenic treatments. Significantly longer median overall survival was found for responders (21.6 months) vs. non-responders (11.9 months). Overall survival was also significantly longer for responders vs. non-responders (based on objective response status at 2, 4, and 6 months) in the landmark analysis. Our results indicate that objective response is an independent predictor of overall survival in this setting, confirming its validity as a rapid marker of efficacy that can be applied in phase II trials; however, further validation is required to determine is validity for other systemic treatments (e.g. immunotherapies), or as a surrogate of overall survival.",Kudo M; Finn RS; Qin S; Han KH; Ikeda K; Cheng AL; Vogel A; Tovoli F; Ueshima K; Aikata H; López CL; Pracht M; Meng Z; Daniele B; Park JW; Palmer D; Tamai T; Saito K; Dutcus CE; Lencioni R,False,study design is not CheckMate RCT,patients with unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma,lenvatinib vs. sorafenib,not specified,overall survival and objective response,phase III study,False,"The study design is a phase III trial, but it focuses on lenvatinib vs. sorafenib, not immune checkpoint inhibitors.

This trial was designed to assess the efficacy and safety of sorafenib versus placebo as adjuvant therapy in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma after surgical resection or local ablation. METHODS: We undertook this phase 3, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma with a complete radiological response after surgical resection (n=900) or local ablation (n=214) in 202 sites (hospitals and research centres) in 28 countries. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive 400 mg oral sorafenib or placebo twice a day, for a maximum of 4 years, according to a block randomisation scheme (block size of four) using an interactive voice-response system. Patients were stratified by curative treatment, geography, Child-Pugh status, and recurrence risk. The primary outcome was recurrence-free survival assessed after database cut-off on Nov 29, 2013. We analysed efficacy in the intention-to-treat population and safety in randomly assigned patients receiving at least one study dose. The final analysis is reported. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00692770. FINDINGS: We screened 1602 patients between Aug 15, 2008, and Nov 17, 2010, and randomly assigned 1114 patients. Of 556 patients in the sorafenib group, 553 (>99%) received the study treatment and 471 (85%) terminated treatment. Of 558 patients in the placebo group, 554 (99%) received the study treatment and 447 (80%) terminated treatment. Median duration of treatment and mean daily dose were 12·5 months (IQR 2·6-35·8) and 577 mg per day (SD 212·8) for sorafenib, compared with 22·2 months (8·1-38·8) and 778·0 mg per day (79·8) for placebo. Dose modification was reported for 497 (89%) of 559 patients in the sorafenib group and 206 (38%) of 548 patients in the placebo group. At final analysis, 464 recurrence-free survival events had occurred (270 in the placebo group and 194 in the sorafenib group). Median follow-up for recurrence-free survival was 8·5 months (IQR 2·9-19·5) in the sorafenib group and 8·4 months (2·9-19·8) in the placebo group. We noted no difference in median recurrence-free survival between the two groups (33·3 months in the sorafenib group vs 33·7 months in the placebo group; hazard ratio [HR] 0·940; 95% CI 0·780-1·134; one-sided p=0·26). The most common grade 3 or 4 adverse events were hand-foot skin reaction (154 [28%] of 559 patients in the sorafenib group vs four [<1%] of 548 patients in the placebo group) and diarrhoea (36 [6%] vs five [<1%] in the placebo group). Sorafenib-related serious adverse events included hand-foot skin reaction (ten [2%]), abnormal hepatic function (four [<1%]), and fatigue (three [<1%]).

Conventional antitumor therapy combined with traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) to limit tumor progression has gradually become the focus of complementary and alternative therapies for HCC treatment. The Fuzheng Jiedu Xiaoji formulation (FZJDXJ) alleviates the clinical symptoms of patients and inhibits tumor progression, but its curative effect still requires extensive clinical research and mechanistic analysis. PURPOSE: To explore the effectiveness of FZJDXJ in HCC patients and investigate its biological function and mechanism underlying anticancer therapy. METHODS: This randomized controlled clinical trial enrolled 291 HCC patients receiving transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (TACE) therapy; patients received either FZJDXJ combined with standard treatment, or standard treatment alone, for 48 weeks. Statistical analyses were performed according to survival time at the end of the trial. The main constituents of the FZJDXJ extracts were identified and evaluated using high-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS/MS) and molecular docking. The antitumor effects of FZJDXJ and its specific biological mechanism of action were studied. RESULTS: After 48 weeks of treatment, one-year overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) were significantly different between the two groups. Co-administration of FZJDXJ and TACE prolonged the OS of HCC patients, especially in BCLC A or B stage. FZJDXJ and TACE treatment effectively extended the PFS of patients, especially in the BCLC B stage. HPLC-MS/MS identified 1619 active constituents of FZJDXJ, including formononetin, chlorogenic acid (CGA), caffeic acid, luteolin, gallic acid, diosgenin, ergosterol endoperoxide, and lupeol, which may function through the AKT/CyclinD1/p21/p27 pathways. Through molecular docking, CGA and gallic acid could effectively combine with Thr308, an important phosphorylation site of AKT1. FZJDXJ inhibited tumor growth in nude mice. In vitro, FZJDXJ-mediated serum inhibited the proliferation, migration, and invasion of liver cancer cells, and promoted cell apoptosis. CONCLUSION: Clinically, FZJDXJ combined with TACE therapy significantly prolonged OS and PFS and reduced the mortality rate of HCC patients. Mechanistically, FZJDXJ effectively inhibited the proliferation and migration of liver cancer cells through the modulation of the AKT/CyclinD1/p21/p27 pathways, and may be a promising TCM drug for anti-HCC therapy.",Yang X; Feng Y; Liu Y; Ye X; Ji X; Sun L; Gao F; Zhang Q; Li Y; Zhu B; Wang X,False,study design is not CheckMate RCT,patients with hepatocellular carcinoma receiving transcatheter arterial chemoembolization,Fuzheng Jiedu Xiaoji formulation combined with standard treatment,standard treatment alone,overall survival and progression-free survival,randomized controlled clinical trial,False,"The study design is a randomized controlled clinical trial, but it focuses on the Fuzheng Jiedu Xiaoji formulation combined with TACE, not immune checkpoint inhibitors.

38,Y90 Radioembolization Significantly Prolongs Time to Progression Compared With Chemoembolization in Patients With Hepatocellular Carcinoma.,10.1053/j.gastro.2016.08.029,"BACKGROUND & AIMS: Conventional transarterial chemoembolization (cTACE) is used to treat patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Radioembolization is a minimally invasive procedure that involves implantation of radioactive micron-sized particles loaded with yttrium-90 (Y90) inside the blood vessels that supply a tumor. We performed a randomized, phase 2 study to compare the effects of cTACE and Y90 radioembolization in patients with HCC. METHODS: From October 2009 through October 2015, we reviewed patients with HCC of all Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC) stages for eligibility. Of these, 179 patients with BCLC stages A or B met our enrollment criteria and were candidates for cTACE or Y90 therapy. Patients were assigned randomly to groups that received Y90 therapy (n = 24; 50% Child-Pugh A) or cTACE (n = 21; 71% Child-Pugh A). The primary outcome was time to progression (TTP), evaluated by intention-to-treat analysis. Secondary outcomes included safety, rate of response (based on tumor size and necrosis criteria), and Kaplan-Meier survival time. We performed inverse probability of censoring weighting and competing risk analyses. RESULTS: Patients in the Y90 radioembolization group had significant longer median TTP (>26 mo) than patients in the cTACE group (6.8 mo; P = .0012) (hazard ratio, 0.122; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.027-0.557; P = .007). This was confirmed by competing risk and inverse probability of censoring weighting analyses accounting for transplantation or death. A significantly greater proportion of patients in the cTACE group developed diarrhea (21%) than in the Y90 group (0%; P = .031) or hypoalbuminemia (58% in the cTACE group vs 4% in the Y90 group; P < .001). Similar proportions of patients in each group had a response to therapy, marked by necrosis (74% in the cTACE group vs 87% in the Y90 group) (P = .433). The median survival time, censored to liver transplantation, was 17.7 months for the cTACE group (95% CI, 8.3-not calculable) vs 18.6 months for the Y90 group (95% CI, 7.4-32.5) (P = .99). CONCLUSIONS: In a randomized phase 2 study of patients with HCC of BCLC stages A or B, we found Y90 radioembolization to provide significantly longer TTP than cTACE.

Group allocation was done with a central randomisation system, with a block size of six, and was stratified by Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status, previous sorafenib treatment, and presence of vascular invasion or extrahepatic metastasis. The primary endpoint was overall survival, which was defined as time from randomisation to death from any cause, and was analysed in patients who were randomly assigned and received at least one dose of the study drug. Safety analyses were done in patients who received at least one dose of the study treatment and had post-dose safety assessments. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT02329860. FINDINGS: Between April 1, 2014, and May 3, 2017, 400 eligible patients were randomly assigned to receive apatinib (n=267) or placebo (n=133). Seven patients (six in the apatinib group and one in the placebo group) did not receive study treatment and were excluded from efficacy analyses. Overall survival was significantly improved in the apatinib group compared with the placebo group (median 8·7 months [95% CI 7·5‒9·8] vs 6·8 months [5·7‒9·1]; hazard ratio 0·785 [95% CI 0·617‒0·998], p=0·048). 387 patients (257 in the apatinib group and 130 in the placebo group) had a safety assessment after study treatment and were included in safety analyses. The most common treatment-related adverse events of grade 3 or 4 were hypertension (71 [28%] patients in the apatinib group vs three [2%] in the placebo group), hand-foot syndrome (46 [18%] vs none), and decreased platelet count (34 [13%] vs one [1%]). 24 (9%) patients in the apatinib group and 13 (10%) in the placebo group died due to adverse events, but none of these deaths were deemed to be related to treatment by investigators. INTERPRETATION: Apatinib significantly improved overall survival in patients with pretreated advanced hepatocellular carcinoma compared with placebo, with a manageable safety profile.

METHODS: In this open-label, phase III trial, patients with advanced HCC, previously untreated with systemic therapy, were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive HAIC-FO or sorafenib. The primary end point was overall survival (OS) in the intention-to-treat population. An exploratory model for predicting the efficacy of HAIC-FO on the basis of genomic sequencing was developed. RESULTS: Between May 2017 and May 2020, 262 patients were randomly assigned. The median tumor size was 11.2 cm (interquartile range, 8.5-13.7 cm). Macrovascular invasion was present in 65.6%, and the percentage of patients with > 50% tumor volume involvement of the liver and/or Vp-4 portal vein tumor thrombosis was 49.2%. At data cutoff (October 31, 2020), median OS was 13.9 months for HAIC-FO and 8.2 for sorafenib (hazard ratio [HR] 0.408; 95% CI, 0.301 to 0.552; P < .001). Tumor downstaging occurred in 16 (12.3% of 130) patients receiving HAIC-FO, including 15 receiving curative surgery or ablation, and finally achieving a median OS of 20.8 months, with a 1-year OS rate of 93.8%. In high-risk subpopulations, OS was significantly longer with HAIC-FO than with sorafenib (10.8 months v 5.7 months; HR 0.343; 95% CI, 0.219 to 0.538; P < .001). A newly developed 15-mutant-gene prediction model identified 83% of patients with response to HAIC-FO.

Adjuvant immunotherapy is considered a promising avenue. This multicenter, open-label, randomized, controlled, phase 2 trial was conducted at six hospitals in China to assess the efficacy and safety of adjuvant sintilimab, a programmed cell death protein 1 inhibitor, in these patients. Eligible patients with HCC with MVI were randomized (1:1) into the sintilimab or active surveillance group. The sintilimab group received intravenous injections every 3 weeks for a total of eight cycles. The primary endpoint was recurrence-free survival (RFS) in the intention-to-treat population. Key secondary endpoints included overall survival (OS) and safety. From September 1, 2020, to April 23, 2022, a total of 198 eligible patients were randomly allocated to receive adjuvant sintilimab (n = 99) or undergo active surveillance (n = 99). After a median follow-up of 23.3 months, the trial met the prespecified endpoints. Sintilimab significantly prolonged RFS compared to active surveillance (median RFS, 27.7 versus 15.5 months; hazard ratio 0.534, 95% confidence interval 0.360-0.792; P = 0.002). Further follow-up is needed to confirm the difference in OS. In the sintilimab group, 12.4% of patients experienced grade 3 or 4 treatment-related adverse events, the most common of which were elevated alanine aminotransferase levels (5.2%) and anemia (4.1%).

42,Characterization of response to atezolizumab + bevacizumab versus sorafenib for hepatocellular carcinoma: Results from the IMbrave150 trial.,10.1002/cam4.4090,"BACKGROUND: IMbrave150 is a phase III trial that assessed atezolizumab + bevacizumab (ATEZO/BEV) versus sorafenib (SOR) in patients with unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and demonstrated a significant improvement in clinical outcomes. Exploratory analyses characterized objective response rate (ORR), depth (DpR), and duration of response (DoR), and patients with a complete response (CR). METHODS: Patients were randomized 2:1 to intravenous ATEZO (1200 mg) + BEV (15 mg/kg) every 3 weeks or oral SOR (400 mg) twice daily. Tumors were evaluated using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors version 1.1 (RECIST 1.1) and HCC-modified RECIST (mRECIST). ORR by prior treatment and largest baseline liver lesion size, DoR, time to response (TTR), and complete response (TTCR) were analyzed. RESULTS: For both criteria, responses favored ATEZO/BEV versus SOR regardless of prior treatment and in patients with lesions ≥3 cm. Median TTR was 2.8 months per RECIST 1.1 (range: 1.2-12.3 months) and 2.8 months per mRECIST (range: 1.1-12.3 months) with ATEZO/BEV. Patients receiving ATEZO/BEV had a greater DpR, per both criteria, across baseline liver lesion sizes. Characteristics of complete responders were similar to those of the intent-to-treat population. In complete responders receiving ATEZO/BEV per mRECIST versus RECIST 1.1, respectively, median TTCR was shorter (5.5 vs. 7.0 months), mean baseline sum of lesion diameter was longer (5.0 [SD, 5.1] vs. 2.6 [SD, 1.4] cm), and mean largest liver lesion size was larger (4.8 [SD, 4.2] vs. 2.3 [SD, 1.0] cm).

43,A positive feedback loop between Periostin and TGFβ1 induces and maintains the stemness of hepatocellular carcinoma cells via AP-2α activation.,10.1186/s13046-021-02011-8,"BACKGROUND: Liver cancer stem cells (LCSCs) play key roles in the metastasis, recurrence, and chemotherapeutic resistance of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Our previous research showed that the POSTN gene is closely related to the malignant progression and poor prognosis of HCC. This study aimed to elucidate the role of POSTN in generating LCSCs and maintaining their stemness as well as the underlying mechanisms. METHODS: Human HCC tissues and matched adjacent normal tissues were obtained from 110 patients. Immunohistochemistry, western blotting (WB), and RT-PCR were performed to detect the expression of POSTN and stemness factors. The roles of transforming growth factor (TGF)-β1 and AP-2α in the POSTN-induced stemness transformation of HCC cells were explored in vitro and in vivo using LCSCs obtained by CD133(+) cell sorting. RESULTS: The high expression of POSTN was correlated with the expression of various stemness factors, particularly CD133, in our HCC patient cohort and in TCGA and ICGC datasets. Knockdown of POSTN expression decreased the abilities of HCC cell lines to form tumours in xenograft mouse models. Knockdown of POSTN expression also suppressed cell viability and clone formation, invasion, and sphere formation abilities in vitro. Knockdown of AP-2α attenuated the generation of CD133(+) LCSCs and their malignant behaviours, indicating that AP-2α was a critical factor that mediated the POSTN-induced stemness transformation and maintenance of HCC cells. The role of AP-2α was verified by using a specific αvβ3 antagonist, cilengitide, in vitro and in vivo. Activation of POSTN could release TGFβ1 from the extracellular matrix and initiated POSTN/TGFβ1 positive feedback signalling. Furthermore, we found that the combined use of cilengitide and lenvatinib suppressed the growth of HCC cells with high POSTN expression more effectively than the use of lenvatinib alone in the patient-derived xenograft (PDX) mouse model. CONCLUSIONS: The POSTN/TGFβ1 positive feedback pathway regulates the expression of stemness factors and the malignant progression of HCC cells by regulating the transcriptional activation of AP-2α.

44,Efficacy and Safety of Transarterial Chemoembolization Plus External Beam Radiotherapy vs Sorafenib in Hepatocellular Carcinoma With Macroscopic Vascular Invasion: A Randomized Clinical Trial.,10.1001/jamaoncol.2017.5847,"IMPORTANCE: Patients with hepatocellular carcinoma showing macroscopic vascular invasion have a poor prognosis. Sorafenib is the sole treatment option for these patients, with unsatisfactory response and survival benefit. Combined treatment with transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) plus external beam radiotherapy (RT) has shown promising results for these patients in observational studies. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of TACE plus RT compared with sorafenib for patients with hepatocellular carcinoma and macroscopic vascular invasion. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: In this randomized, open-label clinical trial conducted at an academic tertiary care center between July 1, 2013, and October 31, 2016, 90 treatment-naive patients with liver-confined hepatocellular carcinoma showing macroscopic vascular invasion were randomly assigned to receive sorafenib (400 mg twice daily; 45 participants [the sorafenib group]) or TACE (every 6 weeks) plus RT (within 3 weeks after the first TACE, maximum 45 Gy with the fraction size of 2.5 to 3 Gy; 45 participants [the TACE-RT group]). MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary end point was the 12-week progression-free survival rate by intention-to-treat analysis. Radiologic response was assessed by independent review according to the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST; version 1.1). Treatment crossover was permitted after confirming disease progression. RESULTS: Of the 90 patients (median age, 55 years; range, 33-82 years), 77 were men and 13 were women. All patients had portal vein invasion of hepatocellular carcinoma and Child-Pugh class A liver function. The median maximal tumor diameter was 9.7 cm. Most patients (71 [78.9%]) had multiple lesions. At week 12, the progression-free survival rate was significantly higher in the TACE-RT group than the sorafenib group (86.7% vs 34.3%; P < .001). The TACE-RT group showed a significantly higher radiologic response rate than the sorafenib group at 24 weeks (15 [33.3%] vs 1 [2.2%]; P < .001), a significantly longer median time to progression (31.0 vs 11.7 weeks; P < .001), and significantly longer overall survival (55.0 vs 43.0 weeks; P = .04). Curative surgical resection was conducted for 5 patients (11.1%) in the TACE-RT group owing to downstaging. No patients in the TACE-RT group discontinued treatment owing to hepatic decompensation. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: For patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma showing macroscopic vascular invasion, first-line treatment with TACE plus RT was well tolerated and provided an improved progression-free survival, objective response rate, time to progression, and overall survival compared with sorafenib treatment.

We aimed to evaluate patient-reported outcomes (PROs) with atezolizumab plus bevacizumab versus sorafenib in patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma in the IMbrave150 trial, which has already shown significant overall survival and progression-free survival benefits with this combination therapy. METHODS: We did an open-label, randomised, phase 3 trial in 111 hospitals and cancer centres across 17 countries or regions. We included patients aged 18 years or older with systemic, treatment-naive, histologically, cytologically, or clinically confirmed unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma and an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0 or 1, with disease that was not amenable to curative surgical or locoregional therapies, or progressive disease after surgical or locoregional therapies. Participants were randomly assigned (2:1; using permuted block randomisation [blocks of six], stratified by geographical region; macrovascular invasion, extrahepatic spread, or both; baseline alpha-fetoprotein concentration; and ECOG performance status) to receive 1200 mg atezolizumab plus 15 mg/kg bevacizumab intravenously once every 3 weeks or 400 mg sorafenib orally twice a day, until loss of clinical benefit or unacceptable toxicity. The independent review facility for tumour assessment was masked to the treatment allocation. Previously reported coprimary endpoints were overall survival and independently assessed progression-free survival per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors 1.1. Prespecified secondary and exploratory analyses descriptively evaluated treatment effects on patient-reported quality of life, functioning, and disease symptoms per the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) quality-of-life questionnaire for cancer (QLQ-C30) and quality-of-life questionnaire for hepatocellular carcinoma (QLQ-HCC18). Time to confirmed deterioration of PROs was analysed in the intention-to-treat population; all other analyses were done in the PRO-evaluable population (patients who had a baseline PRO assessment and at least one assessment after baseline). The trial is ongoing; enrolment is closed. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03434379. FINDINGS: Between March 15, 2018, and Jan 30, 2019, 725 patients were screened and 501 patients were enrolled and randomly assigned to atezolizumab plus bevacizumab (n=336) or sorafenib (n=165). 309 patients in the atezolizumab plus bevacizumab group and 145 patients in the sorafenib group were included in the PRO-evaluable population. At data cutoff (Aug 29, 2019) the median follow-up was 8·6 months (IQR 6·2-10·8). EORTC QLQ-C30 completion rates were 90% or greater for 23 of 24 treatment cycles in both groups (range 88-100% in the atezolizumab plus bevacizumab group and 80-100% in the sorafenib group). EORTC QLQ-HCC18 completion rates were 90% or greater for 20 of 24 cycles in the atezolizumab plus bevacizumab group (range 88-100%) and 21 of 24 cycles in the sorafenib group (range 89-100%). Compared with sorafenib, atezolizumab plus bevacizumab reduced the risk of deterioration on all EORTC QLQ-C30 generic cancer symptom scales that were prespecified for analysis (appetite loss [hazard ratio (HR) 0·57, 95% CI 0·40-0·81], diarrhoea [0·23, 0·16-0·34], fatigue [0·61, 0·46-0·81], pain [0·46, 0·34-0·62]), and two of three EORTC QLQ-HCC18 disease-specific symptom scales that were prespecified for analysis (fatigue [0·60, 0·45-0·80] and pain [0·65, 0·46-0·92], but not jaundice [0·76, 0·55-1·07]). At day 1 of treatment cycle five (after which attrition in the sorafenib group was more than 50%), the mean EORTC QLQ-C30 score changes from baseline in the atezolizumab plus bevacizumab versus sorafenib groups were: -3·29 (SD 17·56) versus -5·83 (20·63) for quality of life, -4·02 (19·42) versus -9·76 (21·33) for role functioning, and -3·77 (12·82) versus -7·60 (15·54) for physical functioning.

46,Efficacy and safety of selective internal radiotherapy with yttrium-90 resin microspheres compared with sorafenib in locally advanced and inoperable hepatocellular carcinoma (SARAH): an open-label randomised controlled phase 3 trial.,10.1016/S1470-2045(17)30683-6,"BACKGROUND: Sorafenib is the recommended treatment for patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma. We aimed to compare the efficacy and safety of sorafenib to that of selective internal radiotherapy (SIRT) with yttrium-90 ((90)Y) resin microspheres in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma. METHODS: SARAH was a multicentre, open-label, randomised, controlled, investigator-initiated, phase 3 trial done at 25 centres specialising in liver diseases in France. Patients were eligible if they were aged at least 18 years with a life expectancy greater than 3 months, had an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0 or 1, Child-Pugh liver function class A or B score of 7 or lower, and locally advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer [BCLC] stage C), or new hepatocellular carcinoma not eligible for surgical resection, liver transplantation, or thermal ablation after a previously cured hepatocellular carcinoma (cured by surgery or thermoablative therapy), or hepatocellular carcinoma with two unsuccessful rounds of transarterial chemoembolisation. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) by a permutated block method with block sizes two and four to receive continuous oral sorafenib (400 mg twice daily) or SIRT with (90)Y-loaded resin microspheres 2-5 weeks after randomisation. Patients were stratified according to randomising centre, ECOG performance status, previous transarterial chemoembolisation, and presence of macroscopic vascular invasion. The primary endpoint was overall survival. Analyses were done on the intention-to-treat population; safety was assessed in all patients who received at least one dose of sorafenib or underwent at least one of the SIRT work-up exams. This study has been completed and the final results are reported here. The trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01482442. FINDINGS: Between Dec 5, 2011, and March 12, 2015, 467 patients were randomly assigned; after eight patients withdrew consent, 237 were assigned to SIRT and 222 to sorafenib. In the SIRT group, 53 (22%) of 237 patients did not receive SIRT; 26 (49%) of these 53 patients were treated with sorafenib. Median follow-up was 27·9 months (IQR 21·9-33·6) in the SIRT group and 28·1 months (20·0-35·3) in the sorafenib group. Median overall survival was 8·0 months (95% CI 6·7-9·9) in the SIRT group versus 9·9 months (8·7-11·4) in the sorafenib group (hazard ratio 1·15 [95% CI 0·94-1·41] for SIRT vs sorafenib; p=0·18). In the safety population, at least one serious adverse event was reported in 174 (77%) of 226 patients in the SIRT group and in 176 (82%) of 216 in the sorafenib group. The most frequent grade 3 or worse treatment-related adverse events were fatigue (20 [9%] vs 41 [19%]), liver dysfunction (25 [11%] vs 27 [13%]), increased laboratory liver values (20 [9%] vs 16 [7%]), haematological abnormalities (23 [10%] vs 30 [14%]), diarrhoea (three [1%] vs 30 [14%]), abdominal pain (six [3%] vs 14 [6%]), increased creatinine (four [2%] vs 12 [6%]), and hand-foot skin reaction (one [<1%] vs 12 [6%]). 19 deaths in the SIRT group and 12 in the sorafenib group were deemed to be treatment related. INTERPRETATION: In patients with locally advanced or intermediate-stage hepatocellular carcinoma after unsuccessful transarterial chemoembolisation, overall survival did not significantly differ between the two groups. Quality of life and tolerance might help when choosing between the two treatments.

47,Molecular predictors of prevention of recurrence in HCC with sorafenib as adjuvant treatment and prognostic factors in the phase 3 STORM trial.,10.1136/gutjnl-2018-316408,"OBJECTIVE: Sorafenib is the standard systemic therapy for advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Survival benefits of resection/local ablation for early HCC are compromised by 70% 5-year recurrence rates. The phase 3 STORM trial comparing sorafenib with placebo as adjuvant treatment did not achieve its primary endpoint of improving recurrence-free survival (RFS). The biomarker companion study BIOSTORM aims to define (A) predictors of recurrence prevention with sorafenib and (B) prognostic factors with B level of evidence. DESIGN: Tumour tissue from 188 patients randomised to receive sorafenib (83) or placebo (105) in the STORM trial was collected. Analyses included gene expression profiling, targeted exome sequencing (19 known oncodrivers), immunohistochemistry (pERK, pVEGFR2, Ki67), fluorescence in situ hybridisation (VEGFA) and immunome. A gene signature capturing improved RFS in sorafenib-treated patients was generated. All 70 RFS events were recurrences, thus time to recurrence equalled RFS. Predictive and prognostic value was assessed using Cox regression models and interaction test. RESULTS: BIOSTORM recapitulates clinicopathological characteristics of STORM. None of the biomarkers tested (related to angiogenesis and proliferation) or previously proposed gene signatures, or mutations predicted sorafenib benefit or recurrence. A newly generated 146-gene signature identifying 30% of patients captured benefit to sorafenib in terms of RFS (p of interaction=0.04). These sorafenib RFS responders were significantly enriched in CD4(+) T, B and cytolytic natural killer cells, and lacked activated adaptive immune components. Hepatocytic pERK (HR=2.41; p=0.012) and microvascular invasion (HR=2.09; p=0.017) were independent prognostic factors. CONCLUSION: In BIOSTORM, only hepatocytic pERK and microvascular invasion predicted poor RFS. No mutation, gene amplification or previously proposed gene signatures predicted sorafenib benefit.

48,Survival in Patients With Recurrent Intermediate-Stage Hepatocellular Carcinoma: Sorafenib Plus TACE vs TACE Alone Randomized Clinical Trial.,10.1001/jamaoncol.2024.1831,"IMPORTANCE: Transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) is commonly used to treat patients with recurrent intermediate-stage hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and positive microvascular invasion (MVI); however, TACE alone has demonstrated unsatisfactory survival benefits. A previous retrospective study suggested that TACE plus sorafenib (SOR-TACE) may be a better therapeutic option compared with TACE alone. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the clinical outcomes of SOR-TACE vs TACE alone for patients with recurrent intermediate-stage HCC after R0 hepatectomy with positive MVI. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: In this phase 3, open-label, multicenter randomized clinical trial, patients with recurrent intermediate-stage HCC and positive MVI were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio via a computerized minimization technique to either SOR-TACE treatment or TACE alone. This trial was conducted at 5 hospitals in China, and enrolled patients from October 2019 to December 2021, with a follow-up period of 24 months. Data were analyzed from June 2023 to September 2023. INTERVENTIONS: Randomization to on-demand TACE (conventional TACE: doxorubicin, 50 mg, mixed with lipiodol and gelatin sponge particles [diameter: 150-350 μm]; drug-eluting bead TACE: doxorubicin, 75 mg, mixed with drug-eluting particles [diameter: 100-300 μm or 300-500 μm]) (TACE group) or sorafenib, 400 mg, twice daily plus on-demand TACE (SOR-TACE group) (conventional TACE: doxorubicin, 50 mg, mixed with lipiodol and gelatin sponge particles [diameter, 150-350 μm]; drug-eluting bead TACE: doxorubicin, 75 mg, mixed with drug-eluting particles [diameter: 100-300 μm or 300-500 μm]). MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary end point was overall survival by intention-to-treat analysis. Safety was assessed in patients who received at least 1 dose of study treatment. RESULTS: A total of 162 patients (median [range] age, 55 [28-75] years; 151 males [93.2%]), were randomly assigned to be treated with either SOR-TACE (n = 81) or TACE alone (n = 81). The median overall survival was significantly longer in the SOR-TACE group than in the TACE group (22.2 months vs 15.1 months; hazard ratio [HR], 0.55; P < .001). SOR-TACE also prolonged progression-free survival (16.2 months vs 11.8 months; HR, 0.54; P < .001), and improved the objective response rate when compared with TACE alone based on the modified Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors criteria (80.2% vs 58.0%; P = .002). Any grade adverse events were more common in the SOR-TACE group, but all adverse events responded well to treatment. No unexpected adverse events or treatment-related deaths occurred in this study. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: The results of this randomized clinical trial demonstrated that SOR-TACE achieved better clinical outcomes than TACE alone. These findings suggest that combined treatment should be used for patients with recurrent intermediate-stage HCC after R0 hepatectomy with positive MVI.

49,Cabozantinib plus atezolizumab versus sorafenib for advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (COSMIC-312): final results of a randomised phase 3 study.,10.1016/S2468-1253(23)00454-5,"BACKGROUND: The aim of the COSMIC-312 trial was to evaluate cabozantinib plus atezolizumab versus sorafenib in patients with previously untreated advanced hepatocellular carcinoma. In the initial analysis, cabozantinib plus atezolizumab significantly prolonged progression-free survival versus sorafenib. Here, we report the pre-planned final overall survival analysis and updated safety and efficacy results following longer follow-up. METHODS: COSMIC-312 was an open-label, randomised, phase 3 study done across 178 centres in 32 countries. Patients aged 18 years or older with previously untreated advanced hepatocellular carcinoma were eligible. Patients must have had measurable disease per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumours version 1.1 (RECIST 1.1), and adequate marrow and organ function, including Child-Pugh class A liver function; those with fibrolamellar carcinoma, sarcomatoid hepatocellular carcinoma, or combined hepatocellular cholangiocarcinoma were ineligible. Patients were randomly assigned (2:1:1) using a web-based interactive response system to a combination of oral cabozantinib 40 mg once daily plus intravenous atezolizumab 1200 mg every 3 weeks, oral sorafenib 400 mg twice daily, or oral single-agent cabozantinib 60 mg once daily. Randomisation was stratified by disease aetiology, geographical region, and presence of extrahepatic disease or macrovascular invasion. Dual primary endpoints were for cabozantinib plus atezolizumab versus sorafenib: progression-free survival per RECIST 1.1, as assessed by a blinded independent radiology committee, in the first 372 randomly assigned patients (previously reported) and overall survival in all patients randomly assigned to cabozantinib plus atezolizumab or sorafenib. The secondary endpoint was progression-free survival in all patients randomly assigned to cabozantinib versus sorafenib. Outcomes in all randomly assigned patients, including final overall survival, are presented. Safety was assessed in all randomly assigned patients who received at least one dose of study drug. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03755791. FINDINGS: Between Dec 7, 2018, and Aug 27, 2020, 432 patients were randomly assigned to combination treatment, 217 to sorafenib, and 188 to single-agent cabozantinib, and included in all efficacy analyses. 704 (84%) patients were male and 133 (16%) were female. 824 of these patients received at least one dose of study treatment and were included in the safety population. Median follow-up was 22·1 months (IQR 19·3-24·8). Median overall survival was 16·5 months (96% CI 14·5-18·7) for the combination treatment group and 15·5 months (12·2-20·0) for the sorafenib group (hazard ratio [HR] 0·98 [0·78-1·24]; stratified log-rank p=0·87). Median progression-free survival was 6·9 months (99% CI 5·7-8·2) for the combination treatment group, 4·3 months (2·9-6·1) for the sorafenib group, and 5·8 months (99% CI 5·4-8·2) for the single-agent cabozantinib group (HR 0·74 [0·56-0·97] for combination treatment vs sorafenib; HR 0·78 [99% CI 0·56-1·09], p=0·05, for single-agent cabozantinib vs sorafenib). Grade 3 or 4 adverse events occurred in 281 (66%) of 429 patients in the combination treatment group, 100 (48%) of 207 patients in the sorafenib group, and 108 (57%) of 188 patients in the single-agent cabozantinib group; the most common were hypertension (37 [9%] vs 17 [8%] vs 23 [12%]), palmar-plantar erythrodysaesthesia (36 [8%] vs 18 [9%] vs 16 [9%]), aspartate aminotransferase increased (42 [10%] vs eight [4%] vs 17 [9%]), and alanine aminotransferase increased (40 [9%] vs six [3%] vs 13 [7%]). Serious adverse events occurred in 223 (52%) patients in the combination treatment group, 84 (41%) patients in the sorafenib group, and 87 (46%) patients in the single agent cabozantinib group. Treatment-related deaths occurred in six (1%) patients in the combination treatment group (encephalopathy, hepatic failure, drug-induced liver injury, oesophageal varices haemorrhage, multiple organ dysfunction syndrome, and tumour lysis syndrome), one (<1%) in the sorafenib group (general physical health deterioration), and four (2%) in the single-agent cabozantinib group (asthenia, gastrointestinal haemorrhage, sepsis, and gastric perforation). INTERPRETATION: First-line cabozantinib plus atezolizumab did not improve overall survival versus sorafenib in patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma. The progression-free survival benefit of the combination versus sorafenib was maintained, with no new safety signals.

Here, we present 5-year results from this cohort. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients were randomized 1 : 1 : 1 to arm A [nivolumab 1 mg/kg plus ipilimumab 3 mg/kg Q3W (four doses)] or arm B [nivolumab 3 mg/kg plus ipilimumab 1 mg/kg Q3W (four doses)], each followed by nivolumab 240 mg Q2W, or arm C (nivolumab 3 mg/kg Q2W plus ipilimumab 1 mg/kg Q6W). The primary objectives were safety, tolerability, investigator-assessed objective response rate (ORR), and duration of response (DOR) per RECIST version 1.1. RESULTS: A total of 148 patients were randomized across treatment arms. At 60-month minimum follow-up (62.6-month median follow-up), the ORR was 34% (n = 17), 27% (n = 13), and 29% (n = 14) in arms A, B, and C, respectively. The median DOR was 51.2 months [95% confidence interval (CI) 12.6 months-not estimable (NE)], 15.2 months (95% CI 7.1 months-NE), and 21.7 months (95% CI 4.2 months-NE), respectively. The median overall survival (OS) was 22.2 months (34/50; 95% CI 9.4-54.8 months) in arm A, 12.5 months (38/49; 95% CI 7.6-16.4 months) in arm B, and 12.7 months (40/49; 95% CI 7.4-30.5 months) in arm C; 60-month OS rates were 29%, 19%, and 21%, respectively. In an exploratory analysis of OS by response (6-month landmark), the median OS was meaningfully longer for responders versus nonresponders for all arms. No new safety signals were identified with longer follow-up. There were no new discontinuations due to immune-mediated adverse events since the primary analysis.

51,Proton beam radiotherapy versus transarterial chemoembolization for hepatocellular carcinoma: Results of a randomized clinical trial.,10.1002/cncr.34965,"BACKGROUND: This study compares survival rates, recurrence patterns, toxicity, and treatment cost in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) treated with either transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) or proton beam radiotherapy (PBT). METHODS: Subjects with untreated HCC meeting Milan or San Francisco transplant criteria were recruited. Subjects were randomized to receive PBT (n = 36) or TACE (n = 40). Proton therapy was administered in 15 fractions over 3 weeks to a total dose of 70.2 Gy. TACE was repeated until complete or maximal response. The primary outcome measure was overall survival (OS). Secondary end points were progression-free survival (PFS), local control (LC), toxicity, and cost. RESULTS: Of the 76 randomized patients, 74 were assessed for outcome measures. The 2-year OS for PBT versus TACE was similar at 68%, 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.54-0.86, and 65%, 95% CI, 0.52-0.83 (p = .80), however, median PFS was improved for PBT versus TACE (not reached vs. 12 months, p = .002). LC was improved with PBT versus TACE (hazard ratio, 5.64; 95% CI, 1.78-17.9, p = .003). Days of posttreatment hospitalization were 24 for PBT and 166 for TACE (p < .001). Total mean cost per patient for treatment and posttreatment care revealed a 28% cost savings for PBT. CONCLUSIONS: PBT and TACE yielded similar OS for treatment of HCC, but PFS and LC were improved with PBT compared to TACE. Patients treated with PBT required fewer courses of treatment, fewer posttreatment hospitalization days, and reduced cost of treatment compared to TACE. These data support the use of PBT as a viable treatment alternative to TACE for patients with HCC within transplant criteria.

52,Adjuvant Transarterial Chemoembolization for HBV-Related Hepatocellular Carcinoma After Resection: A Randomized Controlled Study.,10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-17-2899,"Purpose: The survival of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) recurrence after curative resection is usually poor. We sought to evaluate the safety and efficacy of adjuvant transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) in HBV-related HCC patients with an intermediate (a single tumor larger than 5 cm without microvascular invasion) or high risk (a single tumor with microvascular invasion, or two or three tumors) of recurrence.Experimental Design: In this randomized phase 3 trial, 280 eligible patients were assigned to adjuvant TACE (n = 140) or no adjuvant treatment (control; n = 140) groups. The primary endpoint was recurrence-free survival (RFS); secondary endpoints included overall survival (OS) and safety. Multivariable Cox-proportional hazards model was used to determine the independent impact of TACE on patients' outcomes.Results: Patients who received adjuvant TACE had a significantly longer RFS than those in the control group [56.0% vs. 42.1%, P = 0.01; HR, 0.68; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.49-0.93]. Patients in the adjuvant TACE group had 7.8% higher 3-year OS rate than the control group (85.2% vs. 77.4%; P = 0.04; HR, 0.59; 95% CI, 0.36-0.97). The impact of adjuvant TACE on RFS and OS remained significant after controlling for other known prognostic factors (HR, 0.67; P = 0.01 for RFS; and HR, 0.59; P = 0.04 for OS). There was no grade 3 or 4 toxicity after adjuvant TACE.Conclusions: For patients with HBV-related HCC who had an intermediate or high risk of recurrence after curative hepatectomy, our study showed adjuvant TACE significantly reduced tumor recurrence, improved RFS and OS, and the procedure was well tolerated.

53,Patient-Reported Outcomes From the Phase III HIMALAYA Study of Tremelimumab Plus Durvalumab in Unresectable Hepatocellular Carcinoma.,10.1200/JCO.23.01462,"PURPOSE: In the phase III HIMALAYA study (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT03298451) in unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (uHCC), the Single Tremelimumab Regular Interval Durvalumab (STRIDE) regimen significantly improved overall survival versus sorafenib, and durvalumab monotherapy was noninferior to sorafenib. Patient-reported outcomes (PROs), a secondary outcome from HIMALAYA, are reported here. METHODS: Participants were randomly assigned to receive STRIDE, durvalumab, or sorafenib. PROs were assessed (preplanned secondary outcome) using the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer 30-item Quality of Life Questionnaire and the 18-item HCC module. Time to deterioration (TTD), change from baseline and improvement rate in global health status/quality of life (GHS/QoL), functioning, and disease-related symptoms were analyzed. RESULTS: In total, 1,171 participants were randomly assigned to STRIDE (n = 393), durvalumab (n = 389), or sorafenib (n = 389) and were evaluable for PRO assessments. Across treatment arms, compliance rates for PROs were >77% at baseline and >70% overall. Baseline scores were comparable across treatment arms. TTD in GHS/QoL, physical functioning, fatigue, appetite loss, and abdominal pain was numerically longer for both STRIDE and durvalumab versus sorafenib. Clinically meaningful deterioration in PROs was not observed in any treatment arm. However, TTD in nausea and abdominal swelling was numerically longer for STRIDE versus sorafenib, and the likelihood of clinically meaningful improvement in GHS/QoL, role, emotional and social functioning, and disease-related symptoms was greater with STRIDE and durvalumab versus sorafenib. PROs with STRIDE and durvalumab were generally similar. CONCLUSION: Compared with sorafenib, STRIDE and durvalumab were associated with clinically meaningful, patient-centered GHS/QoL, functioning, and symptom benefits in people with uHCC.

55,Adjuvant Transarterial Chemoembolization With Sorafenib for Portal Vein Tumor Thrombus: A Randomized Clinical Trial.,10.1001/jamasurg.2024.0506,"IMPORTANCE: Certain patients with hepatocellular carcinoma with portal vein tumor thrombus could benefit from surgical resection, and postoperative adjuvant therapy may lower the incidence of tumor recurrence. OBJECTIVE: To compare the efficacy and safety of sorafenib plus transarterial chemoembolization vs sorafenib alone as postoperative adjuvant therapy for patients with hepatocellular carcinoma with portal vein tumor thrombus. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This was a phase 3, multicenter, randomized clinical trial conducted in 5 hospitals in China. A total of 158 patients were enrolled and randomized from October 2019 to March 2022, with a median follow-up of 28.4 months. Portal vein tumor thrombus was graded by the Cheng classification. Eligible patients with hepatocellular carcinoma with Cheng grade I to III portal vein tumor thrombus (ie, involving segmental or sectoral branches, right- or left-side branch, or main trunk of portal vein) were included. INTERVENTIONS: Patients were randomly assigned 1:1 to receive transarterial chemoembolization with sorafenib or sorafenib alone as postoperative adjuvant therapy. Sorafenib treatment was started within 3 days after randomization, with an initial dose of 400 mg orally twice a day. In the transarterial chemoembolization with sorafenib group, transarterial chemoembolization was performed 1 day after the first administration of sorafenib. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary end point was recurrence-free survival. Efficacy was assessed in the intention-to-treat population and safety was assessed in patients who received at least 1 dose of study treatment. RESULTS: Of 158 patients included, the median (IQR) age was 54 (43-61) years, and 140 (88.6%) patients were male. The median (IQR) recurrence-free survival was significantly longer in the transarterial chemoembolization with sorafenib group (16.8 [12.0-NA] vs 12.6 [7.8-18.1] months; hazard ratio [HR], 0.57; 95% CI, 0.39-0.83; P = .002). The median (IQR) overall survival was also significantly longer with transarterial chemoembolization with sorafenib than with sorafenib alone (30.4 [20.6-NA] vs 22.5 [15.4-NA] months; HR, 0.57; 95% CI, 0.36-0.91; P = .02). The most common grade 3/4 adverse event was hand-foot syndrome (23 of 79 patients in the transarterial chemoembolization with sorafenib group [29.1%] vs 24 of 79 patients in the sorafenib alone group [30.4%]). There were no treatment-related deaths in either group. The transarterial chemoembolization with sorafenib group did not show additional toxicity compared with the sorafenib monotherapy group. CONCLUSION AND RELEVANCE: In this study, the combination of sorafenib and transarterial chemoembolization as postoperative adjuvant therapy in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma with portal vein tumor thrombus resulted in longer recurrence-free survival and overall survival than sorafenib alone and was well tolerated.

Preservation of health-related quality of life (HRQOL) during treatment is an important therapeutic goal. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of treatment with lenvatinib versus sorafenib on HRQOL. METHODS: REFLECT was a previously published multicentre, randomised, open-label, non-inferiority phase 3 study comparing the efficacy and safety of lenvatinib versus sorafenib as a first-line systemic treatment for unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma. Eligible patients were aged 18 years or older with unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma and one or more measurable target lesion per modified Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors criteria, Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer stage B or C categorisation, Child-Pugh class A, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 1 or lower, and adequate organ function. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) via an interactive voice-web response system; stratification factors for treatment allocation included region; macroscopic portal vein invasion, extrahepatic spread, or both; ECOG performance status; and bodyweight. Patient-reported outcomes (PROs), collected at baseline, on day 1 of each subsequent cycle, and at the end of treatment, were evaluated in post-hoc analyses of secondary and exploratory endpoints in the analysis population, which was the subpopulation of patients with a PRO assessment at baseline. A linear mixed-effects model evaluated change from baseline in PROs, including European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) Quality of Life Questionnaire Core 30 (QLQ-C30) and hepatocellular carcinoma-specific QLQ-HCC18 scales (both secondary endpoints of the REFLECT trial). Time-to-definitive-deterioration analyses were done based on established thresholds for minimum differences for worsening in PROs. Responder analyses explored associations between HRQOL and clinical response. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT01761266. FINDINGS: Of 954 eligible patients randomly assigned to lenvatinib (n=478) or sorafenib (n=476) between March 14, 2013, and July 30, 2015, 931 patients (n=468 for lenvatinib; n=463 for sorafenib) were included in this analysis. Baseline PRO scores reflected impaired HRQOL and functioning and considerable symptom burden relative to full HRQOL. Differences in overall mean change from baseline estimates in most PRO scales generally favoured the lenvatinib over the sorafenib group, although the differences were not nominally statistically or clinically significant. Patients treated with lenvatinib experienced nominally statistically significant delays in definitive, meaningful deterioration on the QLQ-C30 fatigue (hazard ratio [HR] 0·83, 95% CI 0·69-0·99), pain (0·80, 0·66-0·96), and diarrhoea (0·52, 0·42-0·65) domains versus patients treated with sorafenib. Significant differences in time to definitive deterioration were not observed for other QLQ-C30 domains, and there was no difference in time to definitive deterioration on the global health status/QOL score (0·89, 0·73-1·09). For most PRO scales, differences in overall mean change from baseline estimates favoured responders versus non-responders. Across all scales, HRs for time to definitive deterioration were in favour of responders; median time to definitive deterioration for responders exceeded those for non-responders by a range of 4·8 to 14·6 months. INTERPRETATION: HRQOL for patients undergoing treatment for unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma is an important therapeutic consideration. The evidence of HRQOL benefits in clinically relevant domains support the use of lenvatinib compared with sorafenib to delay functional deterioration in advanced hepatocellular carcinoma.

57,Treatment of localized hepatocellular carcinoma: resection vs. ablation vs. radiation.,10.21037/apm-23-486,"Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a common malignancy with many patients presenting with local disease. As of date, the use of radiation is not included in the commonly utilized Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC) classification but is in the National Comprehensive Cancer Network guidelines. Radiation can volumetrically cover the entire tumor and with novel technologic advances can be administered non-invasively with excellent clinical outcomes with few adverse events. The gold standard for localized early HCC (such as BCLC-A) is resection or transplantation. In patients who are not candidates for surgical treatment, locoregional therapy should be considered as an optimal therapy for these patients. Tumor ablation techniques such as microwave ablation (MWA) and radiofrequency ablation (RFA) are excellent tools to control local disease or bridge to transplantation. Should these not be possible though then ablation with external beam radiation is also capable of yielding comparable local control and serve as a bridge to transplant without worse rates of adverse events. For tumors that meet Milan criteria for transplantation, in comparison to transarterial chemoembolization (TACE), there is considerable randomized evidence demonstrating better local control, less adverse events, better progression-free survival (PFS), and less costly. It can be utilized as a bridge in Barcelona liver class B. For larger localized tumors though (extrahepatic disease or vascular invasion like BCLC-C), stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) is shown via a randomized clinical trial to have a survival benefit, local control benefit, and no worse adverse events compared to systemic therapy.

METHODS AND MATERIALS: Patients were included if they were eligible for TACE. They could also be recruited if they required treatment prior to liver transplantation. A maximum of four TACE-DEB procedures and ablation after incomplete TACE-DEB were both allowed. SBRT was delivered in six fractions of 8-9Gy. Primary end point was time to progression (TTP). Secondary endpoints were local control (LC), overall survival (OS), response rate (RR), toxicity, and quality of life (QoL). The calculated sample size was 100 patients. RESULTS: Between May 2015 and April 2020, 30 patients were randomized to the study. Due to slow accrual the trial was closed prematurely. Two patients in the SBRT arm were considered ineligible leaving 16 patients in the TACE-DEB arm and 12 in the SBRT arm. Median follow-up was 28.1 months. Median TTP was 12 months for TACEDEB and 19 months for SBRT (p=0.15). Median LC was 12 months for TACE-DEB and >40 months (not reached) for SBRT (p=0.075). Median OS was 36.8 months for TACEDEB and 44.1 months for SBRT (p=0.36). A post-hoc analysis showed 100% for SBRT 1- and 2-year LC, and 54.4% and 43.6% for TACE-DEB (p=0.019). Both treatments resulted in RR>80%. Three episodes of possibly related toxicity grade ≥3 were observed after TACE-DEB. No episodes were observed after SBRT. QoL remained stable after both treatment arms. CONCLUSIONS: In this trial, TTP after TACE-DEB was not significantly improved by SBRT, while SBRT showed higher local antitumoral activity than TACE-DEB, without detrimental effects on OS, toxicity and QoL.

We aimed to assess the efficacy of irradiation stent placement with 125 I plus transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (TACE) (ISP-TACE) compared to sorafenib plus TACE (Sora-TACE) in these patients. METHODS: In this multicenter randomized controlled trial, participants with HCC and Vp4 PVTT without extrahepatic metastases were enrolled from November 2018 to July 2021 at 16 medical centers. The primary endpoint was overall survival (OS). The secondary endpoints were hepatic function, time to symptomatic progression, patency of portal vein, disease control rate, and treatment safety. RESULTS: Of 105 randomized participants, 51 were assigned to the ISP-TACE group, and 54 were assigned to the Sora-TACE group. The median OS was 9.9 months versus 6.3 months (95% CI: 0.27-0.82; P =0.01). Incidence of acute hepatic decompensation was 16% (8 of 51) versus 33% (18 of 54) ( P =0.036).

METHODS: A total of 92 cases with massive HCC from October 2019 to January 2021 were prospectively enrolled and randomly divided into the study group (n = 46) and the control group (n = 46). The control group received TACE while the study group were treated with camrelizumab plus TACE. The primary end points were clinical efficacy and adverse events. And the secondary end points were liver function, and alpha fetoprotein (AFP), carcino-embryonic antigen (CEA), carbohydrate antigen 19-9 (CA19-9) levels before and after treatment. RESULTS: All participants were followed-up for 7 to 24 months, with a median of 12 months. Patients in the study group received TACE for 1-3 times, with an average of (2.01 ± 0.09) times, while patients in the control group receive TACE for 2-4 times, with an average of (3.78 ± 0.12) times, and the control group received significantly more TACEs (χ(2) = 5.518, P = 0.019).

62,Cost-effectiveness analysis of Tislelizumab vs Sorafenib as the first-line treatment of unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma.,10.1371/journal.pone.0295090,"BACKGROUND: To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of Tislelizumab vs Sorafenib as the first-line treatment of unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) from the perspective of the Chinese health service system. METHODS: A lifetime partitioned survival model (PSM) was developed to cost-effectively analyze Tislelizumab vs Sorafenib as the first-line treatment of unresectable HCC. The clinical and safety data were derived from a recently randomized clinical trial (RATIONALE-301). Utilities were collected from the published literature. Costs were obtained from an open-access database (http://www.yaozh.com) and previous studies. The model cycle was 21 days, according to the RATIONALE-301 study, and the simulation period was patients' lifetime. Long-term direct medical costs and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) were determined. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) was used as the evaluation index. one-way sensitivity analysis (OSWA) and probabilistic sensitivity analysis (PSA) were used to analyze the uncertainty of parameters and to adjust and verify the stability of the baseline results. RESULTS: The Tislelizumab group generated a cost of $39,746.34 and brought health benefits to 2.146 QALYs, while the cost and utility of the Sorafenib group were $26750.95 and 1.578 QALYs, respectively. The Tislelizumab group increased QALYs by 0.568, the incremental cost was $12995.39, and the ICER was $22869.64/QALY, lower than the willingness to pay threshold (WTP). OSWA results showed that the utility of progressed disease (PD), cost of Camrelizumab, and cost of Tislelizumab were the main factors affecting the ICER. PSA results showed that, within 1000 times the Monte Carlo simulation, the cost of the Tislelizumab group was lower than three times the per capita gross domestic product (GDP) of China ($37653/QALY). The cost-effectiveness acceptability curves (CEAC) revealed that when WTP was no less than $12251.00, the Tislelizumab group was the dominant scheme, and the economic advantage grew with an increasing WTP. When WTP ≥ $19000.00, the Tislelizumab group became the absolute economic advantage. CONCLUSION: Under the current economic conditions in China, the Tislelizumab therapeutic scheme is more cost-effective than the Sorafenib therapeutic scheme for treating patients with unresectable HCC. the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original author and source are credited.",Chen Q; Sun Q; Zhang J; Li B; Feng Q; Liu J,False,study design is not CheckMate RCT,unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma patients,Tislelizumab,Sorafenib,"cost-effectiveness, quality-adjusted life-years",partitioned survival model,False,"Model A correctly identified that the study design is not a CheckMate RCT.

We investigated whether patients with GALNT14-rs9679162 ""non-TT"" unfavorable genotype benefited from chemoembolization plus sorafenib combination therapy. METHODS: Intermediate stage HCC patients were recruited for GALNT14-rs9679162 genotyping before TACE. Patients with ""TT"" genotype received only TACE, labeled as TT (TACE) group. Patients with ""non-TT"" genotype (""GG"" or ""GT"") were randomized to receive either TACE alone, labeled as Non-TT (TACE) group, or TACE plus sorafenib, labeled as Non-TT (TACE + Sora) group. The latter group received sorafenib 400 mg daily plus TACE. RESULTS: From October 2015 to April 2019, 103 HCC patients scheduled to receive chemoembolization were screened. Of them, 84 met inclusion criteria and were assigned to TT (TACE) (n = 25), Non-TT (TACE) (n = 30) and Non-TT (TACE + Sora) (n = 29) groups according to their GALNT14 genotypes. Repeated TACE sessions were performed on-demand and patients were followed until November 2020. It was found that TT (TACE) and Non-TT (TACE + Sora) patients had shorter time-to-complete response compared with that in Non-TT (TACE) patients (p < 0.001 and 0.009, respectively). These two groups also had longer time-to-TACE progression (p < 0.001 and 0.006, respectively) and longer progression-free survival (p = 0.001 and 0.021, respectively).

66,Antibiotic prophylaxis in transarterial chemoembolization of hepatocellular carcinoma.,10.1016/j.ajg.2018.02.002,"BACKGROUND AND STUDY AIMS: Transarterial chemoembolization remains a common treatment option in unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma. However, protocols for pre- and post-procedure care and the role of antibiotic prophylaxis have not been evaluated. The aim of this work was to compare 3 different groups of prophylactic antibiotics in patients undergoing chemoembolization and to compare the efficacy of intravenous versus oral route. PATIENTS AND METHODS: 180 hepatocellular carcinoma patients undergoing transarterial chemoembolization were selected. Patients were classified into 3 groups; Group 1: 60 patients; 30 received intravenous ceftriaxone, and 30 received oral cefixime. Group 2: 60 patients; 30 patients received intravenous levofloxacin and 30 received oral levofloxacin. Group 3: 60 patients; 30 received intravenous ciprofloxacin and 30 received oral ciprofloxacin. All antibiotics were given one day before intervention and for 4 days afterwards. Complete blood count, C-reactive protein, liver and renal function tests were assessed 1 and 5 days and then 1 month after the procedure. RESULTS: The ciprofloxacin group gave better results than the other 2 groups regarding total and differential leucocytic count and C-reactive protein level. No significant difference was found between oral and intravenous routes among the 3 groups. None of the studied patients developed infections or liver abscess after chemoembolization. CONCLUSION: Third generation cephalosporin, levofloxacin or ciprofloxacin all are effective as prophylaxis against post-chemoembolization infections.

Therefore, the authors aim to investigate whether neoadjuvant systemic therapy allows safely administered and effectively reduces post-LT recurrence for those patients. METHODS: In this prospective, randomized, open-label, pilot study, patients with HCC exceeding the MC were randomly assigned to PLENTY or control group before LT. The primary endpoint of the study was the recurrence-free survival after LT. RESULTS: Twenty-two patients were enrolled and randomly assigned: 11 to the PLENTY group and 11 to the control group. The 30-month tumor-specific RFS was 37.5% in the PLENTY group and 12.5% in the control group. The 12-month tumor-specific RFS after LT was significantly improved in the PLENTY group (87.5%) compared to the control group (37.5%) ( P =0·0022). The objective response rate in the PLENTY group was 30 and 60% when determined by RECIST 1.1 and mRECIST, respectively. Six patients (60%) had significant tumor necrosis, including three (30%) who had complete tumor necrosis at histopathology. No acute allograft rejection after LT occurred in the PLENTY and Control group. CONCLUSION: Neoadjuvant pembrolizumab plus lenvatinib before LT appears to be safe and feasible, associated with significantly better RFS for patients exceeding the MC.

68,Construction and validation of a nomogram for hepatocellular carcinoma patients based on HCC-GRIm score.,10.1007/s00432-023-05037-x,"PURPOSE: To construct a nomogram for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients base on HCC-GRIm score. METHODS: Clinical cases of HCC patients diagnosed at Hunan Integrated Traditional Chinese and Western Medicine Hospital were included, and these were randomly divided into the training cohort (n = 219) and the validation cohort (n = 94), and those patients were divided into low GRIm-Score group (scores 0, 1, and 2) and high GRIm-Score group (scores 3, 4, and 5). In the training cohort, independent risk factors were determined by Cox regression analysis, and a nomogram was constructed by independent risk factors. The efficiency and the clinical applicability of nomograms were evaluated using ROC curves, calibration plot, and the decision curve (DCA), and the patients were divided into high-risk, middle-risk, and low-risk groups according to total score of nomogram. RESULTS: Compared to low HCC-GRIm score group, high HCC-GRIm score group with BCLC stage is more advanced (P < 0.001), and fewer patients received TACE (P = 0.005) and surgical treatment (P = 0.001). There was higher rate of the presence of vascular invasion (P < 0.001) and distant metastasis (P < 0.001). Multivariate Cox regression analysis screened 4 independent risk factors to construct a nomogram of HCC patients, including HCC-GRIm score, BCLC stage, albumin-to-globulin ratio (AGR), and glutamyl trans-peptidase (GGT). The consistency index (C-index) of the nomogram of the training was 0.843 (0.832-0.854) and the validation was 0.870 (0.856-0.885). The time-dependent parameter showed the AUC values of the training cohort at 1, 3, and 5 years were 0.954 (95% CI 0.929-0.980), 0.952 (95% CI 0.919-0.985), and 925 (95% CI 0.871-0.979), while the AUC values of validation cohort at 1, 3, and 5 years were 0.974 (95% CI 0.950-0.998), 0.965 (95% CI 0.931-0.999), and 0.959 (95% CI 0.898-1.021). The calibration plot showed the nomogram fits well onto perfect curves, and the DCA curve showed the net benefit of the nomogram at a certain probability threshold is significantly higher than the net benefit of the BCLC stage at the same threshold probability. Finally, all patients were divided into high-risk, middle-risk, and low-risk groups based on the total score of nomogram, and it showed effectively to identify high-risk patients.

69,Sunitinib versus sorafenib plus transarterial chemoembolization for inoperable hepatocellular carcinoma patients.,,"PURPOSE: To compare sunitinib vs sorafenib plus transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) for inoperable hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients. METHODS: From January 2010 to December 2016, 104 patients with inoperable stage III HCC were included and randomly divided into two groups. Patients in the sunitinib+TACE (SU+TACE) group received sunitinib orally 37.5 mg daily, while patients in the sorafenib+TACE (SO+TACE) group received sorafenib 400 mg twice daily. The two groups were given sunitinib or sorafenib on an interrupted schedule, with a 4-7 days interval before or after TACE sessions. TACE treatment was repeated every 6-8 weeks. Patients were treated for about 4-6 cycles until the occurrence of toxicity or patient refusal, or progressive disease. RESULTS: The median overall survival (OS) and the median progression-free survival (PFS) in the SO+TACE group were significantly higher than that in the SU+TACE (OS: p=0.017; PFS: p=0.036, respectively). The rates of response and disease control were higher in the SO+TACE group (58%, 79%, respectively) compared to the SU+TACE group (37%, 66%, respectively), although without statistical significance. Regarding the toxicities, we found higher rates of hand-foot skin reaction (HFSR) in the SO+TACE group, while frequent occurrence of thrombocytopenia and neutropenia in the SU+TACE group.

70,Sorafenib or placebo plus TACE with doxorubicin-eluting beads for intermediate stage HCC: The SPACE trial.,10.1016/j.jhep.2016.01.012,"BACKGROUND & AIMS: Transarterial chemoembolization with doxorubicin-eluting beads (DC Bead®; DEB-TACE) is effective in patients with Barcelona clinic liver cancer stage B hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The multikinase inhibitor sorafenib enhances overall survival (OS) and time-to-tumor progression (TTP) in patients with advanced HCC. This exploratory phase II trial tested the efficacy and safety of DEB-TACE plus sorafenib in patients with intermediate stage HCC. METHODS: Patients with intermediate stage multinodular HCC without macrovascular invasion (MVI) or extrahepatic spread (EHS) were randomized 1:1 to DEB-TACE (150 mg doxorubicin) plus sorafenib 400 mg twice daily or placebo. The primary endpoint was TTP by blinded central review. Secondary endpoints included time to MVI/EHS, OS, overall response rate (ORR) using modified response evaluation criteria in solid tumors, disease control rate (DCR), time to unTACEable progression (TTUP), and safety. RESULTS: Of 307 patients randomized, 154 received sorafenib and 153 received placebo. Median TTP for subjects receiving sorafenib plus DEB-TACE or placebo plus DEB-TACE was similar (169 vs. 166 days, respectively; hazard ratio (HR) 0.797, p=0.072). Median time to MVI/EHS (HR 0.621, p=0.076) and OS (HR 0.898, p=0.29) had not been reached. The ORRs for patients in the sorafenib and placebo groups with post-baseline scans were 55.9% and 41.3%, respectively, and the DCRs were 89.2% and 76.1%, respectively. TTUP was lower with sorafenib than with placebo (HR 1.586; 95% confidence intervals, 1.200-2.096; median 95 vs. 224 days). No unexpected adverse events related to sorafenib were observed.

72,Cost-effectiveness of Pembrolizumab as a Second-Line Therapy for Hepatocellular Carcinoma.,10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2020.33761,"IMPORTANCE: Immune checkpoint inhibitors have been approved for use as a second-line therapy for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in patients who previously received sorafenib. Pembrolizumab has shown substantial antitumor activity and a favorable toxicity profile as a second-line treatment of HCC. However, considering the high cost of pembrolizumab, there is a need to assess its value by considering both the clinical efficacy and cost. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of pembrolizumab vs placebo as second-line therapy in patients with HCC from the US payer perspective. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: A Markov model was developed to compare the lifetime cost and efficacy of pembrolizumab as a second-line treatment of HCC with those of placebo using outcome data from the KEYNOTE-240 randomized placebo-controlled trial, which included 413 patients with advanced HCC previously treated with sorafenib and randomized patients to receive pembrolizumab plus best supportive care or placebo plus best supportive care in a 2:1 ratio. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Life-years, quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), lifetime costs, and incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) were estimated at a willingness-to-pay threshold of $150 000 per QALY. One-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed to account for the parameter of uncertainty. A cost-threshold analysis was also performed. The study was conducted from January 31 to July 29, 2020. RESULTS: The base-case model found that treatment with pembrolizumab was associated with increased overall cost by $47 057 and improved effectiveness by 0.138 QALYs compared with placebo, leading to an ICER of $340 409 per QALY. The model was most sensitive to the hazard ratio of overall survival (range, 0.61-1.00), health utility of placebo (range, 0.59-0.93), price of pembrolizumab (range, $5531-$8297), and price of postprogression therapies (range, $5596-$7944 for pembrolizumab and $4770-$7156 for placebo). The ICER of pembrolizumab was larger than $150 000 per QALY in most of the sensitivity and subgroup analyses. The price of pembrolizumab needed to be reduced by 57.7% to $2925 per cycle to achieve cost-effectiveness. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: The findings of this cost-effectiveness analysis suggest that, at its current price, pembrolizumab is not a cost-effective second-line therapy for HCC in the US, with a willingness-to-pay threshold of $150 000 per QALY.",Chiang CL; Chan SK; Lee SF; Wong IO; Choi HC,True,matches all PICOS criteria,patients with advanced HCC previously treated with sorafenib,pembrolizumab,placebo,"life-years, quality-adjusted life-years, overall survival",randomized placebo-controlled trial,True,"Model A correctly identified that this study meets all PICOS criteria.

AIMS: We evaluated the effects of sunitinib plus doxorubicin-TACE on bleeding or liver failure. METHODS: Seventy-eight patients with HCC were included in this randomized, double-blind study. They received one to three TACE plus either sunitinib or placebo four weeks out of six for one year. The occurrence of severe bleeding or liver failure was assessed during the week after the TACE. The safety and survival outcomes were evaluated. RESULTS: No bleeding complication was reported. One and two liver failures were respectively observed in sunitinib and placebo patients. Compliance to sunitinib treatment was acceptable. Sunitinib dose reduction occurred in 37% of patients due to acute toxicity. Main grade 3-4 toxicities were: thrombocytopenia, neutropenia, increased bilirubin, increased ALT and asthenia.

However, whether DEB-TACE is superior to conventional TACE (cTACE) remains unclear. OBJECTIVE: This randomized controlled trial aimed to compare the efficacy and safety of DEB-TACE versus cTACE in treating HCC with PVTT. METHODS: The study was conducted at a tertiary care center in Southeast China. HCC patients with PVTT were randomized at a 1:1 ratio into the DEB-TACE or cTACE groups. The primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS), and the secondary endpoints were overall survival (OS) and the incidence of adverse events (AEs). An independent review committee assessed the radiologic response according to the modified Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (mRECIST). AEs were assessed by the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 4.0. Systemic therapies were not restricted. RESULTS: Between September 2018 and July 2020, 163 patients were randomized to undergo DEB-TACE ( n =82) or cTACE ( n =81). Nine patients were excluded, and 154 patients were included in the final analysis; the median age was 55 years (range, 24-78 years), and 140 (90.9%) were male. The median PFS in the DEB-TACE group was 6.0 months (95% CI, 5.0-10.0) versus 4.0 months (95% CI, 3.0-5.0) in the cTACE group (hazard ratio, 0.63; 95% CI, 0.42-0.95; P =0.027). The DEB-TACE group showed a higher response rate [51 (66.2%) vs. 36 (46.8%); P =0.0015] and a longer median OS [12.0 months (95% CI, 9.0-16.0) vs. 8.0 months (95% CI, 7.0-11.0), P =0.039] than the cTACE group. Multivariate analysis showed that the treatment group, ALBI score, distant metastasis and additional TKIs were the four independent prognostic factors correlated with PFS. In addition, the treatment group, PVTT group and combination with surgery were independently associated with OS. AEs were similar in the two groups, and postembolization syndrome was the most frequent AE. CONCLUSION: DEB-TACE is superior to cTACE in treating HCC patients with PVTT, demonstrating improved PFS and OS with an acceptable safety profile, and may thus emerge as a promising treatment strategy for HCC patients with PVTT.

76,Development and validation of nomograms to evaluate the survival outcome of HCC patients undergoing selective postoperative adjuvant TACE.,10.1007/s11547-024-01792-0,"PURPOSE: The objective of this study was to develop and validate a novel prognostic nomogram to evaluate the survival benefit of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients receiving postoperative adjuvant transarterial chemoembolization (PA-TACE). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Clinical data of HCC patients who underwent hepatectomy at four medical centers were retrospectively analyzed, including those who received PA-TACE and those who did not. These two categories of patients were randomly allocated to the development and validation cohorts in a 7:3 ratio. RESULTS: A total of 1505 HCC patients who underwent hepatectomy were included in this study, comprising 723 patients who did not receive PA-TACE and 782 patients who received PA-TACE. Among them, patients who received PA-TACE experienced more adverse events, although these events were mild and manageable (Grade 1-2, all p < 0.05). Nomograms were constructed and validated for patients with and without PA-TACE using independent predictors that influenced disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS). These two nomograms had C-indices greater than 0.800 in the development cohort and exhibited good calibration and discrimination ability compared to six conventional HCC staging systems. Patients in the intermediate-to-high-risk group in the nomogram who received PA-TACE had higher DFS and OS (all p < 0.05). In addition, tumor recurrence was significantly controlled in the intermediate-to-high-risk group of patients who received PA-TACE, while there was no significant difference in the low-risk group of patients who received PA-TACE.

METHODS: This single-center prospective randomized study was conducted in the Cancer Hospital, Guang Xi Medical University, Nanning. A total of 72 patients who received treatment in this hospital between August 2017 and July 2019 were included and randomly allocated to TACE group (n = 48) and RT group (n = 24). Next, overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) rates, recurrence patterns, financial burden, and safety were evaluated. RESULTS: The difference between the RT and TACE groups was not significant in one-, three-, and five-year OS (87.5%, 79.0%, and 62.5% vs. 93.8%, 75.9%, and 63.4%, respectively, P = 0.071) and PFS rates (79.0%, 54.2%, and 22.6% vs. 75.0%, 47.9%, and 32.6%, respectively, P = 0.071). Compared to the TACE group, the RT group had significantly lower intrahepatic recurrence rate (20.8% vs. 52.1%, P = 0.011), higher extrahepatic recurrence rate (37.5% vs. 14.6%, P = 0.034), and no marginal and diffuse recurrences (0% vs. 16.7%, P < 0.05). The mean overall treatment cost was higher (¥62,550.59 ± 4397.27 vs. ¥40,732.56 ± 9210.54, P < 0.01), the hospital stay (15.1 ± 3.7 vs. 11.8 ± 4.1 days, P < 0.01) was longer, and the overall treatment stay (13.3 ± 5.3 vs. 41.29 ± 12.4 days, P < 0.01) was shorter in the TACE group than in the RT group. Besides, both groups did not exhibit significant differences in the frequency and severity of adverse events. CONCLUSION: Both adjuvant TACE and RT can better the OS and PFS of patients with HCC.

78,Interim efficacy and safety of PD-1 inhibitors in preventing recurrence of hepatocellular carcinoma after interventional therapy.,10.3389/fimmu.2022.1019772,"INTRODUCTION: Locoregional interventional therapy including transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (TACE) and ablation are the current standard of treatment for early-to-mid-stage hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). However, questions remain unanswered regarding the management of recurrence after locoregional treatment. PD-1 inhibitors can block inhibitory signals of T-cell activation and proliferation to reduce the recurrence. We conducted a single-arm phase 2 trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of PD-1 inhibitors following locoregional interventional therapy in HCC patients with high recurrence risk guided by our novel scoring system. METHODS: Patients enrolled initially treated by TACE combined with ablation, then willingly joined the experimental group. One month later, they received the anti-PD-1 adjuvant therapy (intravenous injection of 200 mg), which was repeated every 3 weeks for a total of 4 or 8 cycles. Within this same period, other patients were screened into the control group to match the experimental group by 1:1 based on the propensity score matching method (PSM). The primary endpoint was relapse-free survival (RFS). Secondary endpoints included overall survival (OS) recurrence modality, safety, and quality of life. RESULT: At the time of data cutoff, the median RFS of the control group was 7.0 months while the experimental group had not reached it. Moreover, the 1-year RFS rate was 73.3% in the experimental group and 46.7% in the control group, showing a significant difference (P =0.02). The rate of local tumor progression in the experimental group was clearly lower than that in the control group (P = 0.027). Benefits associated with anti-PD-1 adjuvant therapy were observed in patients with multiple tumors and tumor size ≤2cm. Univariate and multivariate analyses demonstrated that anti-PD-1 adjuvant therapy was an independent favorable prognostic factor for RFS in HCC patients.

A controlled study was conducted on LABC patients treated at Jianyang People's Hospital and the First Affiliated Hospital of Chengdu Medical College from December 2020 to June 2022. The patients were randomly divided into the experimental group and the control group. The experimental group received DEB-TACE combined with the TAC regimen (175 mg/m(2) paclitaxel-loaded albumin, 50 mg/m(2) Doxorubicin, and 500 mg/m(2) cyclophosphamide), while the control group received the TAC regimen intravenously. The therapeutic efficacy was evaluated using the mRECIST criteria. Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS 22.0 software, and baseline characteristics, overall response rate (ORR), pathological complete response (PCR), adverse reactions, and complications were compared between the two groups using paired t-test and chi-square test. A total of 60 patients were included, with 30 patients in the experimental group (50%) and 30 patients in the control group (50%).

This study compared the safety and efficacy of RE and sorafenib in patients with locally advanced HCC. Patients and Methods SIRveNIB (selective internal radiation therapy v sorafenib), an open-label, investigator-initiated, phase III trial, compared yttrium-90 ((90)Y) resin microspheres RE with sorafenib 800 mg/d in patients with locally advanced HCC in a two-tailed study designed for superiority/detriment. Patients were randomly assigned 1:1 and stratified by center and presence of portal vein thrombosis. Primary end point was overall survival (OS). Efficacy analyses were performed in the intention-to-treat population and safety analyses in the treated population. Results A total of 360 patients were randomly assigned (RE, 182; sorafenib, 178) from 11 countries in the Asia-Pacific region. In the RE and sorafenib groups, 28.6% and 9.0%, respectively, failed to receive assigned therapy without significant cross-over to either group. Median OS was 8.8 and 10.0 months with RE and sorafenib, respectively (hazard ratio, 1.1; 95% CI, 0.9 to 1.4; P = .36). A total of 1,468 treatment-emergent adverse events (AEs) were reported (RE, 437; sorafenib, 1,031). Significantly fewer patients in the RE than sorafenib group had grade ≥ 3 AEs (36 of 130 [27.7%]) v 82 of 162 [50.6%]; P < .001). The most common grade ≥ 3 AEs were ascites (five of 130 [3.8%] v four of 162 [2.5%] patients), abdominal pain (three [2.3%] v two [1.2%] patients), anemia (zero v four [2.5%] patients), and radiation hepatitis (two [1.5%] v zero [0%] patients). Fewer patients in the RE group (27 of 130 [20.8%]) than in the sorafenib group (57 of 162 [35.2%]) had serious AEs.

METHODS: In this open-label, single-center, randomized trial (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT04127396), participants with previously untreated HCC and type I-IV PVTT were randomized 1:1 to receive TACE plus lenvatinib (arm L; orally once daily, 12 mg for body weight ≥60 kg or 8 mg for body weight <60 kg) or TACE plus sorafenib (arm S; 400 mg orally twice daily in 28-day cycles). The primary end point was time-to-progression (TTP; time from randomization to disease progression) and secondary end points included objective response rate and toxicity. Prognostic factors were evaluated using a multivariable Cox proportional hazards model. RESULTS: Between December 30, 2018 and May 31, 2020, 64 patients were randomized (arm L, n = 32; arm S, n = 32); most patients had type I/II PVTT (71.9%), and the median target tumor diameter was 9.8 cm (range, 3.8-21.8). After a median follow-up of 16.1 months, patients in arm L had a higher median TTP (4.7 vs 3.1 months; hazard ratio [HR], 0.55; 95% CI, 0.32-0.95; P = .029) and objective response rate (53.1% vs 25.0%, P = .039) versus arm S.

Comparable safety profiles were observed in arms L and S. CONCLUSIONS: TACE plus lenvatinib was safe, well tolerated, and had favorable efficacy versus TACE plus sorafenib in patients with advanced HCC with PVTT and large tumor burden. LAY SUMMARY: Hepatocellular carcinoma with portal vein tumor thrombus has a poor prognosis. In addition, most phase 3 trials of drugs for hepatocellular carcinoma exclude patients with major portal vein invasion, and treatment options for these patients are limited. Transarterial chemoembolization has shown promising efficacy in these patients, especially in combination with systemic treatment or radiotherapy. However, transarterial chemoembolization plus lenvatinib has not been investigated in this setting.

METHODS: In this three-center open-label study from November 2011 to May 2013, we randomly assigned 189 patients with advanced Child-Pugh class B or C HCC patients into two groups, one group with 95 patient to receive sorafenib (400 mg a time, twice a day) and the other group with 94 patients to receive best supportive care. The primary end points were progression-free survival and overall survival. RESULTS: The median progression-free survival was 2.2 months and 1.9 months in the sorafenib group and best supportive care group respectively (Hazard ratio in the sorafenib group, 0.55; 95% confidence interval, 0.40-0.75; P=0.002). The median overall survival was 4.0 months and 3.5 months in the sorafenib group and best supportive care group respectively (Hazard ratio in the sorafenib group, 0.48; 95% confidence interval, 0.35-0.68; P<0.001). The main adverse effect of sorafenib was rash and acne of the skin (in 51.7% patients). The incidences of severe rash, diarrhea, and dry skin were 5.6%, 5.6%, and 2.2% in the sorafenib group.

METHODS: In this randomized, open-label, phase II trial, patients with unresectable HCC who were TACE treatment-naïve or experienced recurrence after surgical resection or ablation were enrolled at 7 centers in China from March 2019 to November 2019. Participants were randomly assigned (1:1:1) to receive TACE with chemotherapeutic regimen of dicycloplatin alone (group A1), dicycloplatin plus epirubicin (group A2), or epirubicin alone (group B). The primary endpoint was objective response rate (ORR). The secondary endpoints included disease control rate (DCR), duration of response (DOR), progression-free survival (PFS), and safety. RESULTS: The ORR at 6 months in group A1 (n = 22) was significantly better than that in group B (p = 0.093; 90% confidence interval [CI], 1.03-9.45). The DCR in group A1 was significantly higher than that in group B (p = 0.045; 90% CI, 1.29-12.88). There was no significant difference in DOR among the groups (p = 0.271). The median PFS were 6.00 and 3.05 months in groups A2 (n = 25) and B (n = 24), respectively (p = 0.061). Grade 3 or worse adverse events were similar among groups in the safety population (p = 0.173). CONCLUSION: TACE with dicycloplatin was comparably safe and well tolerable as epirubicin alone in patients with unresectable HCC. Compared with epirubicin alone, significant improvement in ORR and DCR when dicycloplatin was applied, as well as prolonged PFS when dicycloplatin plus epirubicin was applied, was generated. KEY POINTS: • To our knowledge, this is the first multicenter randomized trial to assess the efficacy and safety of TACE with dicycloplatin in patients with unresectable HCC. • This phase II trial showed that TACE with dicycloplatin alone or plus epirubicin was comparably safe and well tolerable as epirubicin alone. • Significant improvements in ORR, DCR when dicycloplatin was applied, and prolonged PFS when dicycloplatin plus epirubicin was applied were recorded compared with epirubicin alone.",Zhu HD; Li X; Ji JS; Huang M; Shao GL; Lu J; Zhao XY; Li HL; Yang ZQ; Tu JF; Zhou JM; Zeng CH; Teng GJ,False,Intervention is not immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs),patients with unresectable HCC,TACE with dicycloplatin,TACE with epirubicin,"objective response rate, disease control rate","randomized, open-label, phase II trial",False,"Model A correctly identified that the intervention is not ICIs.

In this phase I/Ib study, we evaluated the safety, pharmacokinetics (PK), pharmacodynamics, and antitumor activity of SAR'459 ± cemiplimab (intravenous) in patients with advanced solid tumors. Increasing doses of SAR'459 were administered every 2 or 3 weeks (Q2W, Q3W) alone (Part 1A) or with 3 mg/kg cemiplimab Q2W or 350 mg Q3W (Part 1B). In Part 2A (dose expansion), melanoma patients were randomly (1:1) administered 22.5 or 7.5 mg/kg SAR'459. In Part 2B (dose expansion), 22.5 mg/kg SAR'459 and 350 mg cemiplimab Q3W were administered. The primary end points were maximum tolerated dose (MTD) or maximum administered dose (MAD; Part 1), preliminary antitumor activity (Part 2B), and optimal monotherapy dose (Part 2A). Twenty-eight and 24 patients were treated in Parts 1A and 1B, respectively; MTD was not reached, MAD was 15 (Q2W) and 22.5 mg/kg (Q3W) alone and in combination, respectively. Fourteen and 95 patients, including 14 hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients, were treated in Parts 2A and 2B, respectively.

85,Partial hepatectomy versus interventional treatment in patients with hepatitis B virus-related hepatocellular carcinoma and clinically significant portal hypertension: a randomized comparative clinical trial.,10.1002/cac2.12614,"BACKGROUND: The widely accepted view that portal hypertension (PHT) is a contraindication to hepatectomy for patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is being increasingly challenged. The long-term survival outcomes and safety of partial hepatectomy versus interventional treatment using ablation with or without pre-ablation transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) in patients with HBV-related HCC within the Milan criteria and with clinically significant PHT were compared in this study. METHODS: This open-label randomized clinical trial was conducted on consecutive patients with clinically PHT and hepatitis B virus (HBV)-related HCC with tumors which were within the Milan criteria. These patients were randomized 1:1 to receive either partial hepatectomy or interventional treatment between December 2012 and June 2018. The primary endpoint was overall survival (OS); secondary endpoints included recurrence-free survival (RFS) and therapeutic safety. RESULTS: Each of the 2 groups had 80 patients. The 1-, 3- and 5-year OS rates in the partial hepatectomy group and the interventional treatment group were 95.0%, 86.2%, 69.5% versus 93.8%, 77.5%, 64.9%, respectively (P = 0.325). The corresponding RFS rates were 78.8%, 55.0%, 46.2% versus 71.3%, 52.5%, 45.0%, respectively (P = 0.783). The partial hepatectomy group had a higher complication rate compared to the interventional group (67.5% vs. 20%, P < 0.001). However, the differences were mainly in Clavien-Dindo Grade I complications (P < 0.001), while not significant in Grade II/III/IV/V (All P > 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: This study shows that partial hepatectomy treatment did not meet prespecified significance for improved OS and RFS compared to interventional treatment for patients with HBV-related HCC within the Milan criteria and with clinically significant PHT.

86,Efficacy and safety of cabozantinib for patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma based on albumin-bilirubin grade.,10.1038/s41416-021-01532-5,"BACKGROUND: Albumin-bilirubin (ALBI) grade is an objective measure of liver function for patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The tyrosine kinase inhibitor cabozantinib is approved for patients with advanced HCC who have received prior sorafenib based on the phase 3 CELESTIAL trial (NCT01908426). Cabozantinib improved overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) versus placebo in patients with previously treated HCC. METHODS: Patients were randomised 2:1 to receive cabozantinib 60 mg or placebo orally every day. Clinical outcomes in patients with ALBI grade 1 or 2 at baseline were evaluated in CELESTIAL. ALBI scores were retrospectively calculated based on baseline serum albumin and total bilirubin, with an ALBI grade of 1 defined as  ≤ -2.60 score and a grade of 2 as a score of > -2.60 to  ≤ -1.39. RESULTS: Cabozantinib improved OS and PFS versus placebo in both ALBI grade 1 (hazard ratio [HR] [95% CI]: 0.63 [0.46-0.86] and 0.42 [0.32-0.56]) and ALBI grade 2 (HR [95% CI]: 0.84 [0.66-1.06] and 0.46 [0.37-0.58]) subgroups. Adverse events were consistent with those in the overall population. Rates of grade 3/4 adverse events associated with hepatic decompensation were generally low and were more common among patients in the ALBI grade 2 subgroup.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Between 2012 and 2015, 12 patients (male/female = 5/7, age 66 y ± 9.8) with biopsy-verified RCC eligible for nephron-sparing surgery or radical nephrectomy were recruited. Mean tumor size was 3.2 cm ± 0.62. Patients were randomized at 1:1 ratio to receive either DEE transarterial chemoembolization or TAE before planned surgery. A microcatheter was used to inject particles selectively into arteries feeding the tumors. Response was evaluated by CT according to modified Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors and by microscopy of excised tumors. Complications were scored according to the Society of Interventional Radiology classification. RESULTS: DEE transarterial chemoembolization (n = 6) resulted in a significantly (P = .018) higher degree of necrosis with an average of 88.3% (range, 70%-100%) compared with TAE (n = 5), which resulted in an average of 29.4% (range, 0-77%), as evaluated by CT. Histopathologic evaluation showed similar results (P = .016) with an average necrosis of 87.5% (range, 80%-95%) for DEE transarterial chemoembolization (n = 4) versus 26% (range, 0-70%) for TAE (n = 5). Percentage of necrosis seen on microscopy correlated significantly (P = .0005) with radiologic findings, as 4 tumors in each arm were evaluated by both CT and microscopy.

88,FDA Supplemental Approval Summary: Lenvatinib for the Treatment of Unresectable Hepatocellular Carcinoma.,10.1002/onco.13566,"On August 16, 2018, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved lenvatinib (Lenvima, Eisai Inc.) for first-line treatment of patients with unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Approval was based on an international, multicenter, randomized, open-label, noninferiority trial (REFLECT; NCT01761266) conducted in 954 patients with previously untreated metastatic or unresectable HCC. Patients were randomized (1:1) to receive lenvatinib (12 mg orally once daily for patients with a baseline body weight ≥60 kg and 8 mg orally once daily for patients with a baseline body weight <60 kg) or sorafenib (400 mg orally twice daily) until radiological disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. REFLECT demonstrated that lenvatinib was noninferior but not statistically superior to sorafenib for overall survival (OS; hazard ratio, [HR] 0.92; 95% confidence intervals [CI], 0.79-1.06), with median OS of 13.6 and 12.3 months in the lenvatinib and sorafenib arms, respectively. REFLECT also demonstrated statistically significant improvements in investigator-assessed progression-free survival (PFS; HR, 0.66; 95% CI, 0.57-0.77]; p < 0.001), corresponding to median PFS of 7.4 and 3.7 months and overall response rate of 24.1% vs 9.2% per modified RECIST for HCC (mRECIST) in the lenvatinib and sorafenib arms, respectively. Consistent results were observed by an independent review facility per RECISTv1.1 and per mRECIST. The most common adverse reactions observed in the lenvatinib-treated patients (≥20%) in decreasing frequency were hypertension, fatigue, diarrhea, decreased appetite, arthralgia/myalgia, decreased weight, abdominal pain, palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia syndrome, proteinuria, dysphonia, hemorrhagic events, hypothyroidism, and nausea. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: This article describes the U.S. Food and Drug Administration's review of data from a single trial, REFLECT, that supported the approval of lenvatinib, as a single agent, for the first-line treatment of unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). REFLECT was an open-label, noninferiority trial that randomized 954 patients with HCC who were ineligible for liver-directed therapy with no prior systemic therapy for HCC to lenvatinib or sorafenib. REFLECT demonstrated that lenvatinib-treated patients had similar survival, more responses, and longer time to progression than those receiving sorafenib. Serious side effects were more common among lenvatinib-treated patients.

In group B, patients were placed in the conventional headfirst position with the left hand placed at the left groin, and TACE was performed via the left radial artery. In group C, patients were placed in the conventional head-first position, and TACE was performed via the right radial artery. In group D, patients were placed in the conventional head-first position, and TACE was performed via the right femoral artery. Before each procedure, thermoluminescent dosimeters were taped at 7 different body parts of the operator and the radiation dose was measured and collected after the procedure. The normalized radiation dose was also calculated. Procedural parameters included radiation dose, fluoroscopy time (FT), dose-area product (DAP), and air kerma (AK) were recorded. Patients' demographics, tumor baseline characteristics, radiation dose, and procedural parameters were compared between groups. RESULTS No significant differences were found in patients' demographics, tumor baseline characteristics, as well as in total FT, DAP, and AK. However, significant differences were found in the total radiation dose received by the operator and the doses on the pelvic cavity and the right wrist (P < .05). In group C, the radiation doses received on the pelvic cavity, the right wrist, and the total radiation doses were relatively higher. Significant differences were also found in the normalized radiation doses received by the operator on the thyroid, chest, left wrist, right wrist, and pelvic cavity, and the total normalized doses (all P < .05). Similarly, the radiation doses received by the operator at the aforementioned parts in group C were higher, while those in group A were lower. CONCLUSION No statistically significant differences were observed in the FT, DAP, and AK in TACE via TRA when patients were placed in different positions. However, TACE via the left TRA, with patients in the feet-first position, reduced the radiation dose received by the operator, thereby reducing the radiation risk.",Jiang H; Chen Y; Liao H; Gu Y; Meng X; Dong W,False,Intervention is not immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs),patients with HCC undergoing TACE,TACE via transradial or transfemoral access,not specified,radiation dose received by operator,randomized trial,False,"Model A correctly identified that the intervention is not ICIs.

Release of Raf-1-Ask-1 dimer and inhibition of Raf-1 via sorafenib putatively differ in the presence or absence of doxorubicin. Cancer and Leukemia Group B (CALGB) 80802 (Alliance) randomized phase III trial of doxorubicin plus sorafenib versus sorafenib in patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), showed no improvement in median overall survival (OS). Whether HCV viral load impacts therapy and whether any correlation between HCV titers and outcome based on HCV was studied. In patients with HCV, HCV titer levels were evaluated at baseline and at multiple postbaseline timepoints until disease progression or treatment discontinuation. HCV titer levels were evaluated in relation to OS and progression-free survival (PFS). Among 53 patients with baseline HCV data, 12 patients had undetectable HCV (HCV-UN). Postbaseline HCV titer levels did not significantly differ between treatment arms. One patient in each arm went from detectable to HCV-UN with greater than 2 log-fold titer levels reduction. Aside from these 2 HCV-UN patients, HCV titers remained stable on treatment. Patients who had HCV-UN at baseline were 3.5 times more likely to progress and/or die from HCC compared with HCV detectable (HR = 3.51; 95% confidence interval: 1.58-7.78; P = 0.002). HCV titer levels remained unchanged, negating any sorafenib impact onto HCV titer levels. Although an overall negative phase III study, patients treated with doxorubicin plus sorafenib and sorafenib only, on CALGB 80802 had worse PFS if HCV-UN. Higher levels of HCV titers at baseline were associated with significantly improved PFS. SIGNIFICANCE: Sorafenib therapy for HCC may impact HCV replication and viral gene expression. In HCV-positive patients accrued to CLAGB 80802 phase III study evaluating the addition of doxorubicin to sorafenib, HCV titer levels were evaluated at baseline and different timepoints. Sorafenib did not impact HCV titer levels.

91,Sorafenib with or without concurrent transarterial chemoembolization in patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma: The phase III STAH trial.,10.1016/j.jhep.2018.11.029,"BACKGROUND & AIMS: Sorafenib is first-line standard of care for patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), yet it confers limited survival benefit. Therefore, we aimed to compare clinical outcomes of sorafenib combined with concurrent conventional transarterial chemoembolization (cTACE) vs. sorafenib alone in patients with advanced HCC. METHODS: In this investigator-initiated, multicenter, phase III trial, patients were randomized to receive sorafenib alone (Arm S, n = 169) or in combination with cTACE on demand (Arm C, n = 170). Sorafenib was started within 3 days and cTACE within 7-21 days of randomization. The primary endpoint was overall survival (OS). RESULTS: For Arms C and S, the median OS was 12.8 vs. 10.8 months (hazard ratio [HR] 0.91; 90% CI 0.69-1.21; p = 0.290); median time to progression, 5.3 vs. 3.5 months (HR 0.67; 90% CI 0.53-0.85; p = 0.003); median progression-free survival, 5.2 vs. 3.6 months (HR 0.73; 90% CI 0.59-0.91; p = 0.01); and tumor response rate, 60.6% vs. 47.3% (p = 0.005). For Arms C and S, serious (grade ≥3) adverse events occurred in 33.3% vs. 19.8% (p = 0.006) of patients and included increased alanine aminotransferase levels (20.3% vs. 3.6%), hyperbilirubinemia (11.8% vs. 3.0%), ascites (11.8% vs. 4.2%), thrombocytopenia (7.2% vs. 1.2%), anorexia (7.2% vs. 1.2%), and hand-foot skin reaction (10.5% vs. 11.4%). A post hoc subgroup analysis compared OS in Arm C patients (46.4%) receiving ≥2 cTACE sessions to Arm S patients (18.6 vs. 10.8 months; HR 0.58; 95% CI 0.40-0.82; p = 0.006). CONCLUSION: Compared with sorafenib alone, sorafenib combined with cTACE did not improve OS in patients with advanced HCC. However, sorafenib combined with cTACE significantly improved time to progression, progression-free survival, and tumor response rate. Sorafenib alone remains the first-line standard of care for patients with advanced HCC. LAY SUMMARY: For patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma requiring sorafenib therapy, co-administration with conventional transarterial chemoembolization did not improve overall survival compared to sorafenib alone. Therefore, sorafenib alone remains the first-line standard of care for patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma. Clinical Trial Number: NCT01829035. Elsevier B.V.

92,Skeletal muscle quality predicts overall survival in advanced liver hepatocellular carcinoma treated with SIRT and sorafenib: A subanalysis of the SORAMIC trial.,10.1002/ueg2.12627,"BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Our purpose was to assess the impact of muscle quality on overall survival (OS) in patients with advanced HCC. METHODS: This is a subanalysis of the SORAMIC trial. Overall, 363 patients were included. The SIRT/Sorafenib treatment group comprised 182 patients and the sorafenib group 181 patients. Myosteatosis was defined as skeletal muscle density (SMD) < 41 HU for patients with a body mass index up to 24.9 kg/m(2) and <33 HU for patients with a body mass index ≥25 kg/m(2). Albumin-gauge score was calculated as follows: serum albumin (g/dL) × SMD (HU). To assess the impact of muscle quality on clinical variables and OS, a Cox regression model was used. Hazard ratios are presented together with 95 % confidence intervals (95 % CI). Kaplan-Meier curves were used for survival analysis. RESULTS: In the SIRT/sorafenib cohort, low albumin-gauge score was an independent predictor of worse OS, HR = 1.74, CI 95% (1.16-2.62), p = 0.01. In the sorafenib cohort, muscle quality parameters did not predict OS. In alcohol-induced HCC (n = 129), myosteatosis independently predicted OS, HR = 1.85, CI 95% (1.10; 3.12), p = 0.02. In viral-induced HCC (n = 99), parameters of muscle quality did not predict OS. In patients with NASH/Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) induced HCC, albumin-gauge score was a strong independent predictor of worse OS in the subgroup undergoing combined treatment with SIRT and sorafenib, HR = 9.86, CI 95% (1.12; 86.5), p = 0.04. CONCLUSIONS: Myosteatosis predicts independently worse OS in patients with alcohol-induced HCC undergoing combined treatment with SIRT and sorafenib. In patients with NASH/NAFLD induced HCC undergoing treatment with SIRT and sorafenib, albumin-gauge score predicts independently worse OS. IMPACT AND IMPLICATIONS: Associations between parameters of muscle quality and OS are different in accordance to the treatment strategy and etiology of HCC. These findings highlight the prognostic potential of skeletal muscle quality in patients with advanced HCC.

METHODS: A randomized controlled study was conducted from August 2016 to December 2019 on patients with unresectable HCC and PVTT. The patients were randomly assigned to RT + TACE group or TACE + RT group in a 1:1 ratio. Evaluation of therapeutic effects on the primary tumor was based on the modified Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (mRECIST), while that on PVTT was based on the changing of Cheng's PVTT classification. The primary end-point was overall survival (OS). RESULTS: The 120 patients who entered this study were evenly assigned to two groups. In the intention-to-treat (ITT) population, the OS rates for RT + TACE group at 1, 2 and 3 years were 61.7%, 27.4% and 15.6%, compared with 45.0%, 16.1% and 4.7% in TACE + RT group. The median OS was increased in patients with RT + TACE compared with those who had TACE + RT with a marginally significance (15.4 versus 11.5 months, HR = 0.68, 95% CI 0.46-1.01, p = 0.054). The median progression-free survival (PFS) in RT + TACE group was 6.6 months versus 4.2 months in TACE + RT group (HR = 0.66, 95% CI 0.46-0.96, p = 0.030). The corresponding disease control rate (DCR) at 3 months was 86.7% versus 66.7% (p = 0.017) and 61.7% versus 46.7% (p = 0.099) at 6 months. In subgroup analyses, RT + TACE was associated with better OS (HR, 0.48; 95% CI 0.33-0.99, p = 0.048) and PFS (HR, 0.55; 95% CI 0.33-0.93, p = 0.026) versus TACE + RT among patients with type III/IV PVTT. There were 3 patients in RT + TACE group and 2 in TACE + RT group had adverse events ≥  grade 3.

94,Impact of body composition in advanced hepatocellular carcinoma: A subanalysis of the SORAMIC trial.,10.1097/HC9.0000000000000165,"BACKGROUND: Body composition parameters have been reported to be prognostic factors in patients with oncologic diseases. However, the available data on patients with HCC are conflicting. The aim of this study was to assess the impact of body composition on survival in patients with HCC treated with sorafenib or selective internal radioembolization (SIRT) and sorafenib. METHODS: This is an exploratory subanalysis of the prospective, randomized controlled SORAMIC trial. Within the palliative arm of the study, patients were selected if a baseline abdominal CT was available. A broad set of skeletal muscle and adipose tissue parameters were measured at the L3 level. Low skeletal muscle mass (LSMM) and density parameters were defined using published cutoffs. The parameters were correlated with overall survival. RESULTS: Of 424 patients in the palliative study arm, 369 patients were included in the analysis. There were 192 patients in the combined sorafenib/SIRT and 177 patients in the sorafenib group. Median overall survival was 9.9 months for the entire cohort and 10.8 and 9.2 months for the SIRT/sorafenib and sorafenib groups, respectively. There was no relevant association of either body composition parameter with overall survival in either the overall cohort or in the SIRT/sorafenib or sorafenib subgroups. CONCLUSIONS: This subanalysis of the prospective SORAMIC trial does not suggest a relevant influence of body composition parameters of survival in patients with advanced HCC.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 90 patients were divided into DEB-TACE group (n = 45) and cTACE group (n = 45). The treatment response, overall survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS), and the safety were compared between the two groups. RESULTS: The objective response rate (ORR) in the DEB-TACE group was significantly higher than that in cTACE group at 1, 3, and 6 months of follow-up (P = 0.031, P = 0.003, P = 0.002). The complete response (CR) in DEB-TACE group was significantly higher than that in cTACE group at 3 months (P = 0.036). Survival analysis revealed that, DEB-TACE group had better survival benefits than cTACE group (median OS: 534 days vs. 367 days, P = 0.027; median PFS: 352 days vs. 278 days P = 0.004).

97,Impact of combined selective internal radiation therapy and sorafenib on survival in advanced hepatocellular carcinoma.,10.1016/j.jhep.2019.08.006,"BACKGROUND & AIMS: Sorafenib is the recommended treatment for patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). We aimed to compare the efficacy and safety of a combination of sorafenib and selective internal radiation therapy (SIRT) - with yttrium-90 ((90)Y) resin microspheres - to sorafenib alone in patients with advanced HCC. METHODS: SORAMIC is a randomised controlled trial comprising diagnostic, local ablation and palliative cohorts. Based on diagnostic study results, patients were assigned to local ablation or palliative cohorts. In the palliative cohort, patients not eligible for TACE were randomised 11:10 to SIRT plus sorafenib (SIRT + sorafenib) or sorafenib alone. The primary endpoint was overall survival (OS; Kaplan-Meier analysis) in the intention-to-treat (ITT) population. RESULTS: In the ITT cohort, 216 patients were randomised to SIRT + sorafenib and 208 to sorafenib alone. Median OS was 12.1 months in the SIRT + sorafenib arm, and 11.4 months in the sorafenib arm (hazard ratio [HR] 1.01; 95% CI 0.81-1.25; p = 0.9529). Median OS in the per protocol population was 14.0 months in the SIRT + sorafenib arm (n = 114), and 11.1 months in the sorafenib arm (n = 174; HR 0.86; p = 0.2515). Subgroup analyses of the per protocol population indicated a survival benefit of SIRT + sorafenib for patients without cirrhosis (HR 0.46; 0.25-0.86; p = 0.02); cirrhosis of non-alcoholic aetiology (HR 0.63; p = 0.012); or patients ≤65 years old (HR 0.65; p = 0.05). Adverse events (AEs) of Common Terminology Criteria for AE Grades 3-4 were reported in 103/159 (64.8%) patients who received SIRT + sorafenib, 106/197 (53.8%) patients who received sorafenib alone (p = 0.04), and 8/24 (33.3%) patients who only received SIRT. CONCLUSION: Addition of SIRT to sorafenib did not result in a significant improvement in OS compared with sorafenib alone. Subgroup analyses led to hypothesis-generating results that will support the design of future studies. LAY SUMMARY: Sorafenib given orally is the recommended treatment for patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). In selective internal radiation therapy (SIRT), also known as radioembolisation, microscopic, radioactive resin or glass spheres are introduced into the blood vessels that feed the tumours in the liver. This study found that the addition of SIRT with (90)yttrium-loaded resin microspheres to sorafenib treatment in people with advanced HCC did not significantly improve overall survival compared with sorafenib treatment alone. However, the results give an indication of how future studies using this combination therapy in people with advanced HCC could be designed. STUDY REGISTRATION: EudraCT 2009-012576-27, NCT0112 6645.

In this report, we aim to assess the efficacy and safety of raltitrexed plus oxaliplatin (OXA)-based transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) in patients with unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (uHCC). Patients with uHCC were recruited from multi-centers in China and assigned randomly to raltitrexed+OXA-based (n=76), fluorouracil+OXA-based (n=76), and doxorubicin+OXA-based (n=75) TACE treatment. The primary end point was overall survival (OS). Tumor response was assessed using response evaluation criteria in solid tumors (RECIST), modified response evaluation criteria in solid tumors (mRECIST), and European Association for the Study of the Liver criteria (EASL).

99,Cost-Effectiveness Analysis of Camrelizumab Plus Rivoceranib Versus Sorafenib as a First-Line Therapy for Unresectable Hepatocellular Carcinoma in the Chinese Health Care System.,10.1007/s40261-024-01343-5,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Camrelizumab plus rivoceranib showed significant clinical benefits in progression-free survival and overall survival compared to sorafenib in patients with unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). This study aimed to assess its cost effectiveness from the perspective of Chinese health care system. METHODS: A Markov state-transition model was developed based on the Phase 3 randomized CARES-310 clinical trial data. Health state utility values were obtained from the CARES-310 clinical trial, and direct medical costs were derived from the relevant literature and local charges. The measured outcomes included quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) and the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER). Probabilistic and one-way sensitivity analyses were performed to assess the uncertainty of the model. RESULTS: In the base-case analysis, the incremental effectiveness and cost of camrelizumab plus rivoceranib versus sorafenib were 0.41 QALYs and $13,684.84, respectively, resulting in an ICER of $33,619.98/QALY, lower than the willingness-to-pay threshold of China ($35,864.61/QALY). Subgroup analyses revealed that the ICERs of camrelizumab plus rivoceranib versus sorafenib were $35,920.01 and $29,717.98 in patients with ALBI grade 1 and grade 2, respectively. One-way sensitivity analyses indicated that the cost of camrelizumab, the proportion of patients receiving subsequent treatment in the camrelizumab plus rivoceranib group, and the cost of rivoceranib were the most significant factors in the base-case analysis. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis suggested that the probabilities of cost effectiveness of camrelizumab plus rivoceranib were 61.27%, 51.46%, and 82.78% for any grade, and ALBI grade 1 and grade 2, respectively.

100,Machine Learning-Based Development of Nomogram for Hepatocellular Carcinoma to Predict Acute Liver Function Deterioration After Drug-Eluting Beads Transarterial Chemoembolization.,10.1016/j.acra.2023.05.014,"RATIONALE AND OBJECTIVES: Acute liver function deterioration (ALFD) following drug-eluting beads transarterial chemotherapy embolism (DEB-TACE) was considered a risk factor for prognosis in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). In this study, we aimed to develop and validate a nomogram for the prediction of ALFD after DEB-TACE. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 288 patients with HCC from a single center were randomly divided into a training dataset (n = 201) and a validation dataset (n = 87). The univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were performed to determine risk factors for ALFD. The least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) was applied to identify the key risk factors and fit a model. The performance, calibration, and clinical utility of the predictive nomogram were assessed using receiver operating characteristic curves, calibration curves, and decision curve analysis (DCA). RESULTS: LASSO regression analysis determined six risk factors with fibrosis index based on four factors (FIB-4) as the independent factor for the occurrence of ALFD after DEB-TACE. Gamma-glutamyltransferase, FIB-4, tumor extent, and portal vein invasion were integrated into the nomogram. In both the training and validation cohorts, the nomogram demonstrated promising discrimination with AUC of 0.762 and 0.878, respectively. The calibration curves and DCA revealed good calibration and clinical utility of the predictive nomogram. CONCLUSION: The nomogram-based risk of ALFD stratification may improve clinical decision-making and surveillance protocols for patients with a high risk of ALFD after DEB-TACE. Elsevier Inc.

101,Prognostic value of baseline imaging and clinical features in patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma.,10.1038/s41416-021-01577-6,"AIMS: To investigate the prognostic value of baseline imaging features for overall survival (OS) and liver decompensation (LD) in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). DESIGN: Patients with advanced HCC from the SORAMIC trial were evaluated in this post hoc analysis. Several radiological imaging features were collected from baseline computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) imaging, besides clinical values. The prognostic value of these features for OS and LD (grade 2 bilirubin increase) was quantified with univariate Cox proportional hazard models and multivariate Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) regression. RESULTS: Three hundred and seventy-six patients were included in this study. The treatment arm was not correlated with OS. LASSO showed satellite lesions, atypical HCC, peritumoral arterial enhancement, larger tumour size, higher albumin-bilirubin (ALBI) score, liver-spleen ratio <1.5, ascites, pleural effusion and higher bilirubin values were predictors of worse OS, and higher relative liver enhancement, smooth margin and capsule were associated with better OS. LASSO analysis for LD showed satellite lesions, peritumoral hypointensity in hepatobiliary phase, high ALBI score, higher bilirubin values and ascites were predictors of LD, while randomisation to sorafenib arm was associated with lower LD.

102,Second-line cabozantinib after sorafenib treatment for advanced hepatocellular carcinoma: a subgroup analysis of the phase 3 CELESTIAL trial.,10.1136/esmoopen-2020-000714,"OBJECTIVE: In the phase 3 CELESTIAL trial, cabozantinib improved overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) compared with placebo in patients with previously treated advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). This subgroup analysis evaluated cabozantinib in patients who had received sorafenib as the only prior systemic therapy. METHODS: CELESTIAL randomised (2:1) patients with advanced HCC and Child-Pugh class A liver function to treatment with cabozantinib (60 mg daily) or placebo. Eligibility required prior treatment with sorafenib, and patients could have received ≤2 prior systemic regimens. The primary endpoint was OS. Outcomes in patients who had received sorafenib as the only prior therapy were analysed by duration of prior sorafenib (<3 months, 3 to <6 months and ≥6 months). RESULTS: Of patients who had received only prior sorafenib, 331 were randomised to cabozantinib and 164 to placebo; 136 patients had received sorafenib for <3 months, 141 for 3 to <6 months and 217 for ≥6 months. Cabozantinib improved OS relative to placebo in the overall second-line population who had received only prior sorafenib (median 11.3 vs 7.2 months; HR=0.70, 95% CI 0.55 to 0.88). This improvement was maintained in analyses by prior sorafenib duration with longer duration generally corresponding to longer median OS-median OS 8.9 vs 6.9 months (HR=0.72, 95% CI 0.47 to 1.10) for prior sorafenib <3 months, 11.5 vs 6.5 months (HR=0.65, 95% CI 0.43 to 1.00) for 3 to <6 months and 12.3 vs 9.2 months (HR=0.82, 95% CI 0.58 to 1.16) for ≥6 months. Cabozantinib also improved PFS in all duration subgroups. Safety data were consistent with the overall study population. CONCLUSION: Cabozantinib improved efficacy outcomes versus placebo in the second-line population who had received only prior sorafenib irrespective of duration of prior sorafenib treatment, further supporting the utility of cabozantinib in the evolving treatment landscape of HCC.

This study aimed to compare the effects of sorafenib and lenvatinib as first-line systemic therapy against uHCC with real-world data in chronic hepatitis B patients. METHODS: This retrospective single-center study involved 132 patients with HBV-related uHCC. Propensity score matching (PSM) was used to balance the baseline characteristics, including age, sex, serum alpha-fetoprotein levels, Child-Pugh class, tumor size, and tumor stage. The primary endpoint was overall survival (OS), and the secondary endpoints included progression-free survival (PFS), time to progression (TTP), and tumor response. RESULTS: After PSM, the final analysis included 44 patients treated with lenvatinib and 88 with sorafenib. The OS (7.0 vs 9.2 months, p = 0.070) and PFS (4.6 vs 2.4 months, p = 0.134) were comparable between the two drugs. Multivariable analysis showed that lenvatinib and sorafenib were not independent prognostic factors of OS (adjusted hazard ratio = 1.41, 95% confidence interval = 0.96-2.08, p = 0.077) after adjustment for baseline alpha-fetoprotein levels, total bilirubin levels, alanine aminotransferase level, performance status, tumor stage, and tumor size. However, the lenvatinib group had a significantly prolonged TTP (5.2 vs 2.5 months, p = 0.018) and a higher objective response rate (18.2% vs 4.5%, p = 0.020) and disease control rate (77.3% vs 47.7%, p = 0.001) than the sorafenib group.

104,Prognostic factors and predictors of sorafenib benefit in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma: Analysis of two phase III studies.,10.1016/j.jhep.2017.06.026,"BACKGROUND & AIMS: Sorafenib, an oral multikinase inhibitor, significantly prolonged overall survival (OS) vs. placebo in patients with unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in two phase III studies, SHARP (Sorafenib HCC Assessment Randomized Protocol) and Asia Pacific (AP). To assess prognostic factors for HCC and predictive factors of sorafenib benefit, we conducted a pooled exploratory analysis from these placebo-controlled phase III studies. METHODS: To identify potential prognostic factors for OS, univariate and multivariate (MV) analyses were performed for baseline variables by Cox proportional hazards model. Hazard ratios (HRs) and median OS were evaluated across pooled subgroups. To assess factors predictive of sorafenib benefit, the interaction term between treatment for each subgroup was evaluated by Cox proportional hazard model. RESULTS: In 827 patients (448 sorafenib; 379 placebo) analyzed, strong prognostic factors for poorer OS identified from MV analysis in both treatment arms were presence of macroscopic vascular invasion (MVI), high alpha-fetoprotein (AFP), and high neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR; ⩽ vs. >median [3.1]). Sorafenib OS benefit was consistently observed across all subgroups. Significantly greater OS sorafenib benefit vs. placebo was observed in patients without extrahepatic spread (EHS; HR, 0.55 vs. 0.84), with hepatitis C virus (HCV) (HR, 0.47 vs. 0.81), and a low NLR (HR, 0.59 vs. 0.84). CONCLUSIONS: In this exploratory analysis, presence of MVI, high AFP, and high NLR were prognostic factors of poorer OS. Sorafenib benefit was consistently observed irrespective of prognostic factors. Lack of EHS, HCV, and lower NLR were predictive of a greater OS benefit with sorafenib. LAY SUMMARY: This exploratory pooled analysis showed that treatment with sorafenib provides a survival benefit in all subgroups of patients with HCC; however, the magnitude of benefit is greater in patients with disease confined to the liver (without extrahepatic spread), or in those with hepatitis C virus, or a lower neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio, an indicator of inflammation status. These results help inform the prognosis of patients receiving sorafenib therapy and provide further refinements for the design of trials testing new agents vs. sorafenib.

This analysis assessed correlations between serum or tissue biomarkers and efficacy outcomes from REFLECT. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Serum biomarkers (VEGF, ANG2, FGF19, FGF21, and FGF23) were measured by ELISA. Gene expression in tumor tissues was measured by the nCounter PanCancer Pathways Panel. Pharmacodynamic changes in serum biomarker levels from baseline, and associations of clinical outcomes with baseline biomarker levels, were evaluated. RESULTS: Four hundred and seven patients were included in the serum analysis set (lenvatinib n = 279, sorafenib n = 128); 58 patients were included in the gene-expression analysis set (lenvatinib n = 34, sorafenib n = 24). Both treatments were associated with increases in VEGF; only lenvatinib was associated with increases in FGF19 and FGF23 at all time points. Lenvatinib-treated responders had greater increases in FGF19 and FGF23 versus nonresponders at cycle 4, day 1 (FGF19: 55.2% vs. 18.3%, P = 0.014; FGF23: 48.4% vs. 16.4%, P = 0.0022, respectively). Higher baseline VEGF, ANG2, and FGF21 correlated with shorter OS in both treatment groups. OS was longer for lenvatinib than sorafenib [median, 10.9 vs. 6.8 months, respectively; HR, 0.53; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.33-0.85; P-interaction = 0.0397] with higher baseline FGF21. In tumor tissue biomarker analysis, VEGF/FGF-enriched groups showed improved OS with lenvatinib versus the intermediate VEGF/FGF group (HR, 0.39; 95% CI, 0.16-0.91; P = 0.0253). CONCLUSIONS: Higher baseline levels of VEGF, FGF21, and ANG2 may be prognostic for shorter OS.

106,Priming of Sorafenib Prior to Radiofrequency Ablation Does Not Increase Treatment Effect in Hepatocellular Carcinoma.,10.1007/s10620-021-07156-2,"BACKGROUND: Preclinical studies have shown that modulation of the tumor microvasculature with anti-angiogenic agents decreases tumor perfusion and may increase the efficacy of radiofrequency ablation (RFA) in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Retrospective studies suggest that sorafenib given prior to RFA promotes an increase in the ablation zone, but prospective randomized data are lacking. AIMS: We conducted a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase II trial to evaluate the efficacy of a short-course of sorafenib prior to RFA for HCC tumors sized 3.5-7 cm (NCT00813293). METHODS: Treatment consisted of sorafenib 400 mg twice daily for 10 days or matching placebo, followed by RFA on day 10. The primary objectives were to assess if priming with sorafenib increased the volume and diameter of the RFA coagulation zone and to evaluate its impact on RFA thermal parameters. Secondary objectives included feasibility, safety and to explore the relationship between tumor blood flow on MRI and RFA effectiveness. RESULTS: Twenty patients were randomized 1:1. Priming with sorafenib did not increase the size of ablation zone achieved with RFA and did not promote significant changes in thermal parameters, although it significantly decreased blood perfusion to the tumor by 27.9% (p = 0.01) as analyzed by DCE-MRI. No subject discontinued treatment owing to adverse events and no grade 4 toxicity was observed. CONCLUSION: Priming of sorafenib did not enhance the effect of RFA in intermediate sized HCC. Future studies should investigate whether longer duration of treatment or a different antiangiogenic strategy in the post-procedure setting would be more effective in impairing tumor perfusion and increasing RFA efficacy.

METHODS: The retrospective study was conducted on 112 unresectable HCC patients who underwent pretherapeutic MRI examinations. Patients were randomly divided into training (n = 79) and validation cohorts (n = 33). A total of 396 radiomics features were extracted from the volume of interest of the primary lesion by the Artificial Kit software. The least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression was applied to identify optimal radiomic features. After feature selection, three models, including the clinical, radiomics, and combined models, were developed to predict the non-response of unresectable HCC to HAIC treatment. The performance of these models was evaluated by the receiver operating characteristic curve. According to the most efficient model, a nomogram was established, and the performance of which was also assessed by calibration curve and decision curve analysis. Kaplan-Meier curve and log-rank test were performed to evaluate the Progression-free survival (PFS). RESULTS: Using the LASSO regression, we ultimately selected three radiomics features from T2-weighted images to construct the radiomics score (Radscore). Only the ALBI score was an independent factor associated with non-response in the clinical model (P = 0.033). The combined model, which included the ALBI score and Radscore, achieved better performance in the prediction of non-response, with an AUC of 0.79 (95% CI 0.68-0.90) and 0.75 (95% CI 0.58-0.92) in the training and validation cohorts, respectively. The nomogram based on the combined model also had good discrimination and calibration (P = 0.519 for the training cohort and P = 0.389 for the validation cohort). The Kaplan-Meier analysis also demonstrate that the high-score patients had significantly shorter PFS than the low-score patients (P = 0.031) in the combined model, with median PFS 6.0 vs 9.0 months.

METHODS: Patients with unresectable HCC were randomized 1:1 to receive TACE with miriplatin or epirubicin in lipiodol. The primary endpoint was OS; secondary endpoints were percentages of patients who achieved treatment effect (TE) 4 (100% necrotizing effect or tumor reduction), duration of time to TACE failure, and adverse events (AEs). OS was compared using a stratified log-rank test adjusted for clinical stage, Child-Pugh class, and institution. RESULTS: Of 257 patients enrolled from August 2008 to August 2010, 247 were analyzed for efficacy and toxicity (miriplatin, n = 124; epirubicin, n = 123). Baseline characteristics were well balanced between the two groups. Median OS times were 1111 days for miriplatin and 1127 days for epirubicin (adjusted hazard ratio 1.01, 95% confidence interval 0.73-1.40, P = 0.946). TE4 rates were 44.4% for miriplatin and 37.4% for epirubicin. Median times to TACE failure were 365.5 days for miriplatin and 414.0 days for epirubicin. AEs of grade 3 or higher, including elevated aspartate aminotransferase (miriplatin, 39.5%; epirubicin, 57.7%) and elevated alanine aminotransferase (miriplatin, 31.5%; epirubicin, 53.7%), were less frequent in the miriplatin than the epirubicin group.

EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: The analysis population comprised 25 patients receiving SIRT+sorafenib and 20 patients receiving sorafenib alone. Patients were classified as responders or nonresponders based on changes in AFP and imaging or overall survival. Proteomic analysis was performed on plasma EVs by LC/MS, followed by bioinformatics analysis. Clinical relevance of candidate EV proteins was validated by survival and receiver-operating characteristic analysis with bootstrap internal sampling validation. Origin of circulating EV was explored by IHC staining of liver and tumor tissues and transcriptomics of blood cells. RESULTS: Proteomic analysis identified 56 and 27 EV proteins that were differentially expressed in plasma EVs between responders and nonresponders receiving SIRT+sorafenib and sorafenib alone, respectively. High EV-GPX3/ACTR3 and low EV-ARHGAP1 were identified as candidate biomarkers at baseline from the 13 responders to SIRT+sorafenib with statistically significant AUC = 1 for all and bootstrap P values 2.23 × 10-5, 2.22 × 10-5, and 2.23 × 10-5, respectively. These patients showed reduced abundance of EV-VPS13A and EV-KALRN 6 to 9 weeks after combined treatment with significant AUC and bootstrap P values.

The primary endpoint is 1-year local control (LC): 18 events were needed to assess a 45% difference (HR: 0.18) in favor of SBRT. The secondary endpoints are 1-year Progression-Free Survival (PFS), Distant Recurrence-Free Survival (DRFS), Overall Survival (OS) and the incidence of acute and late complications. Results: At the time of the final analysis, 40 patients were enrolled, 19 (49%) in the TAE/TACE arm and 21 (51%) in the SBRT arm. The trial was prematurely closed due to slow accrual. The 1- and 2-year LC rates were 57% and 36%. The use of SBRT resulted in superior LC as compared to TAE/TACE rechallenge (median not reached versus 8 months, p = 0.0002). PFS was 29% and 16% at 1 and 2 years, respectively. OS was 86% and 62% at 1 year and 2 years, respectively. In the TAE arm, PFS was 13% and 6% at 1 and 2 years, respectively. In the SBRT arm, at 1 and 2 years, PFS was 37% and 21%, respectively. OS at 1 and 2 years was 75% and 64% in the SBRT arm and 95% and 57% in the TACE arm, respectively. No grade >3 toxicity was recorded. Conclusions: SBRT is an effective treatment option in patients affected by inoperable HCC experiencing an incomplete response following ≥1 cycle of TAE/TAC.",Comito T; Loi M; Franzese C; Clerici E; Franceschini D; Badalamenti M; Teriaca MA; Rimassa L; Pedicini V; Poretti D; Solbiati LA; Torzilli G; Ceriani R; Lleo A; Aghemo A; Santoro A; Scorsetti M,False,Intervention is not immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs),patients with hepatocellular carcinoma,Stereotactic Body Radiotherapy (SBRT),standard TAE/TACE,"1-year local control, progression-free survival, overall survival",randomized controlled trial,False,"Model A correctly identified that the intervention is not immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs).

METHODS: A multicenter, randomized controlled trial was conducted in patients with high-risk recurrence factors after curative resection of HCC from 9 medical centers between July 2014 and July 2018. Totally 249 patients were randomly assigned to TACE with or without Cidan Capsule administration groups by stratified block in a 1:1 ratio. Postoperative adjuvant TACE was given 4-5 weeks after hepatic resection in both groups. Additionally, 125 patients in the TACE plus Cidan group were administrated Cidan Capsule (0.27 g/capsule, 5 capsules every time, 4 times a day) for 6 months with a 24-month follow-up. Primary endpoints included disease-free survival (DFS) and tumor recurrence rate (TRR). Secondary endpoint was overall survival (OS). Any drug-related adverse events (AEs) were observed and recorded. RESULTS: As the data cutoff in July 9th, 2018, the median DFS was not reached in the TACE plus Cidan group and 234.0 days in the TACE group (hazard ratio, 0.420, 95% confidence interval, 0.290-0.608; P<0.01). The 1- and 2-year TRR in the TACE plus Cidan and TACE groups were 31.5%, 37.1%, and 60.8%, 63.4%, respectively (P<0.01). Median OS was not reached in both groups. The 1- and 2-year OS rates in TACE plus Cidan and TACE groups were 98.4%, 98.4%, and 89.5%, 87.9%, respectively (P<0.05). The most common grade 3-4 AEs included fatigue, abdominal pain, lumbar pain, and nausea. One serious AE was reported in 1 patient in the TACE plus Cidan group, the death was due to retroperitoneal mass hemorrhage and hemorrhagic shock, and was not related to study drug. CONCLUSIONS: Cidan Capsule in combination with TACE can reduce the incidence of early recurrence in HCC patients at high-risk of recurrence after radical hepatectomy and may be an appropriate option in postoperative anti-recurrence treatment.

112,Liver function after combined selective internal radiation therapy or sorafenib monotherapy in advanced hepatocellular carcinoma.,10.1016/j.jhep.2021.07.037,"BACKGROUND & AIMS: SORAMIC is a previously published randomised controlled trial assessing survival in patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma who received sorafenib with or without selective internal radiation therapy (SIRT). Based on the per-protocol (PP) population, we assessed whether the outcome of patients receiving SIRT+sorafenib vs. sorafenib alone was affected by adverse effects of SIRT on liver function. METHODS: The PP population consisted of 109 (SIRT+sorafenib) vs. 173 patients (sorafenib alone). Comparisons were made between subgroups who achieved a significant survival benefit or trend towards improved survival with SIRT and the inverse group without a survival benefit: <65 years-old vs. ≥65 years-old, Child-Pugh 5 vs. 6, no transarterial chemoembolisation (TACE) vs. prior TACE, no cirrhosis vs. cirrhosis, non-alcohol- vs. alcohol-related aetiology. The albumin-bilirubin (ALBI) score was used to monitor liver function over time during follow-up. RESULTS: ALBI scores increased in all patient groups during follow-up. In the PP population, ALBI score increases were higher in the SIRT+sorafenib than the sorafenib arm (p = 0.0021 month 4, p <0.0001 from month 6). SIRT+sorafenib conferred a survival benefit compared to sorafenib alone in patients aged <65 years-old, those without cirrhosis, those with Child-Pugh 5, and those who had not received TACE. A higher increase in ALBI score was observed in the inverse subgroups in whom survival was not improved by adding SIRT (age ≥65 years-old, p <0.05; cirrhosis, p = 0.07; Child-Pugh 6, p <0.05; prior TACE, p = 0.08). CONCLUSION: SIRT frequently has a negative, often subclinical, effect on liver function in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma, which may impair prognosis after treatment. Careful patient selection for SIRT as well as prevention of clinical and subclinical liver damage by selective treatments, high tumour uptake ratio, and medical prophylaxis could translate into better efficacy. CLINICAL TRIAL NUMBER: EudraCT 2009-012576-27, NCT01126645 LAY SUMMARY: This study of treatments in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma found that selective internal radiation therapy (SIRT) has an adverse effect on liver function that may affect patient outcomes.

113,Pravastatin combination with sorafenib does not improve survival in advanced hepatocellular carcinoma.,10.1016/j.jhep.2019.04.021,"BACKGROUND & AIMS: Sorafenib is the standard of care for advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Combining sorafenib with another treatment, to improve overall survival (OS) within an acceptable safety profile, might be the next step forward in the management of patients with advanced HCC. We aimed to assess whether a combination of sorafenib and a statin improved survival in patients with HCC. METHODS: The objective of the PRODIGE-11 trial was to compare the respective clinical outcomes of the sorafenib-pravastatin combination (arm A) versus sorafenib alone (arm B) in patients with advanced HCC. Child-Pugh A patients with advanced HCC who were naive to systemic treatment (n = 323) were randomly assigned to sorafenib-pravastatin combination (n = 162) or sorafenib alone (n = 161). The primary endpoint was OS; secondary endpoints were progression-free survival, time to tumor progression, time to treatment failure, safety, and quality of life. RESULTS: After randomization, 312 patients received at least 1 dose of study treatment. After a median follow-up of 35 months, 269 patients died (arm A: 135; arm B: 134) with no difference in median OS between treatments arms (10.7 months vs. 10.5 months; hazard ratio = 1.00; p = 0.975); no difference was observed in secondary survival endpoints either. In the univariate analysis, the significant prognostic factors for OS were CLIP score, performance status, and quality of life scores. The multivariate analysis showed that the only prognostic factor for OS was the CLIP score. The main toxicity was diarrhea (which was severe in 11% of patients in arm A, and 8.9% in arm B), while severe nausea-vomiting was rare, and no toxicity-related deaths were reported. CONCLUSION: Adding pravastatin to sorafenib did not improve survival in patients with advanced HCC. LAY SUMMARY: Sorafenib has proven efficacy for the treatment of patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma. However, overall survival remains poor in these patients, so we were interested to see if the addition of a statin, pravastatin, improved outcomes in patients with advanced HCC.

114,Pattern of progression in advanced hepatocellular carcinoma treated with ramucirumab.,10.1111/liv.14731,"BACKGROUND & AIMS: Radiological progression patterns to first-line sorafenib have been associated with post-progression and overall survival in advanced hepatocellular carcinoma, but these associations remain unknown for therapies in second- and later-line settings. This post hoc analysis of REACH and REACH-2 examined outcomes by radiological progression patterns in the second-line setting of patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma treated with ramucirumab or placebo. METHODS: Patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma, Child-Pugh A and Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group Performance Status 0 or 1 with prior sorafenib were randomized to receive ramucirumab 8mg/kg or placebo every 2 weeks. Among 625 patients with ≥1 progression pattern (new extrahepatic lesion [including new macrovascular invasion], new intrahepatic lesion, extrahepatic growth or intrahepatic growth), data were analysed by trial and for pooled individual patient data for REACH-2 and REACH (alpha-fetoprotein ≥400 ng/mL). Cox models evaluated prognostic implications of progression patterns on overall and post-progression survival. RESULTS: Post-progression survival was worse among those with new extrahepatic lesions in REACH (HR 2.33, 95% CI 1.51-3.60), REACH-2 (HR 1.49, 95% CI 0.72-3.08) and the pooled population (HR 1.75, 95% CI 1.12-2.74) compared to other progression patterns. Overall survival was also significantly reduced in those with new extrahepatic lesions across studies. Ramucirumab provided an overall survival benefit across progression patterns, including patients with new extrahepatic lesions (HR 0.56, 95% CI 0.39-0.80) in the pooled population.

Therefore, the selection of patients for repeated cTACE is challenging owing to different outcomes. This study aimed to establish a decision-making scoring system for repeated cTACE to guide further treatment. METHODS: All patients with hepatocellular carcinoma who underwent cTACE between 2008 and 2019 were included and randomly assigned into training (n = 324) and validation (n = 162) cohorts. Tumor Size, number of Masses, Albumin-bilirubin score, baseline Alpha-fetoprotein level, and Response to initial cTACE session were selected to generate a ""SMAART"" score in the training cohort. Patients were stratified according to the SMAART score: low risk, 0-2; medium risk, 3-4; and high risk, 5-8. Prediction error curves based on the integrated Brier score and the Harrell C-index validated the SMAART scores and compared them with the Assessment for Retreatment with Transarterial chemoembolization (ART) score. RESULTS: The low-risk group had the longest median overall survival of 39.0 months, followed by the medium-risk and high-risk groups of 21.2 months and 10.5 months, respectively, with significant differences (P < 0.001). The validation cohort had similar results. The high-risk group had 63.1% TACE refractory cases. The Harrell C-indexes were 0.562 and 0.665 and the integrated Brier scores were 0.176 and 0.154 for ART and SMAART scores, respectively. DISCUSSION: The SMAART score can aid clinicians in selecting appropriate candidates for subsequent cTACE. A SMAART score of ≥5 after the first cTACE session identified patients with poor prognosis who may not benefit from additional cTACE sessions. behalf of The American College of Gastroenterology.",Bannangkoon K; Hongsakul K; Tubtawee T; Janjindamai P; Akkakrisee S; Piratvisuth T; Geater A,False,Intervention is not immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs),patients with hepatocellular carcinoma,repeated cTACE,not specified,overall survival,retrospective study,False,"Model A correctly identified that the intervention is not immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs).

The placebo group received an infusion of 5% glucose solution until 48 h after procedure. The post-embolization syndrome was defined as: T ≥ 38.5 c and serum ALT > 3 times of pretreatment value. RESULTS: In total, 111 HCC patients were enrolled; 57 were randomly assigned to NAC group and 54 to placebo group. The incidence of post-embolization syndrome was lower in NAC group (24.6%) compared to placebo group (48.2%); P = 0.01. On multivariate analysis, receiving IV NAC (P = 0.03) and HCC diameter (P < 0.01) were associated with developing post-embolization syndrome. Post-TACE liver decompensation was documented in 26/111 (23.4%) patients. There was no difference in the incidence of post-TACE liver decompensation between NAC and placebo group. CONCLUSIONS: In this study, intravenous NAC administration reduces the incidence of post-embolization syndrome after TACE in patients with HCC. However, it does not prevent post-TACE liver decompensation.

122,Effect of decoction of Fuzheng Jiedu Xiaoji formula plus chemoembolization on primary liver cancer in patients.,10.19852/j.cnki.jtcm.2022.03.011,"OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effect of the decoction of Fuzheng Jiedu Xiaoji formula (, FJXF) plus chemoembolization (TACE) on primary liver cancer (PLC) in patients, and study the underlying mechanism. METHODS: Patients with PLC who met the inclusion criteria were randomized into case group and control group. The case group was treated with FJXF combined with TACE. The control group was treated with TACE alone. The short-term clinical effect was evaluated; liver biochemistry, liver function index and multidrug resistance-associated indicators were detected. RESULTS: FJXF combined with TACE in the case group significantly increased the disease control rate than TACE alone in the control group (83.3% 61.1%). There was a reduction in the serum alpha-fetoprotein at 8 weeks after treatment in each group, while no difference between the two groups. The same trend can be observed for transaminase and direct bilirubin in both groups. In the case group, it showed a significant increase for albumin at 8 weeks after treatment, while no change in the control group. Multidrug resistance-associated indicators for multidrug resistance protein 1 and p-glycoprotein were upregulated in the case group but remained stable in the control group. CONCLUSIONS: FJXF combined TACE had a better short-term effect than TACE alone in patients with PLC. The potential mechanism was probably associated with alleviated multidrug resistance induced by FJXF.

We compared the efficacy of TACE with cisplatin versus with epirubicin in patients with unresectable HCC. METHODS: This multicentre, randomised, phase 2/3 trial was performed at 21 hospitals in Japan. Patients with liver-confined HCC, performance status 0-2, and Child-Pugh class A/B were randomised to receive TACE with cisplatin or epirubicin. Patients were stratified in accordance with the institution, Child-Pugh class, tumour size, tumour thrombosis, α-fetoprotein and prior treatment. The primary end-point was overall survival in the intention-to-treat population. Tumour response was evaluated in accordance with the Response evaluation criteria in solid tumours criteria. FINDINGS: Between 2008 and 2012, 455 patients were randomly assigned to undergo TACE with cisplatin (n = 228) or epirubicin (n = 227). Eleven patients were ineligible, and 444 patients were included in the full analysis. Twelve patients not receiving TACE were excluded, and 432 patients were included in the safety analysis set.

METHODS: Sixty patients with gastroesophageal junction cancer and hepatic metastasis were randomly divided into two groups: group A (treatment group), which was treated with transarterial infusion chemotherapy plus microsphere embolization for gastroesophageal cancer, and with transarterial chemoembolization for hepatic metastasis; and group B (control group), which was treated with transarterial infusion chemotherapy for gastroesophageal cancer, and with transarterial chemoembolization for hepatic metastasis. The chemotherapy regimen used consisted of oxaliplatin plus FUDR. The embolization agent used for gastroesophageal cancer and the hepatic metastasis were Embosphere and ultra-liquefied lipiodol, respectively. RESULTS: The median survival time of patients in group A was 19 months, with survival rates at 12, 18, and 24 months of 93.3%, 60.0%, and 23.3%, respectively. The median survival time of patients in group B was 13 months, with survival rates at 12, 18, and 24 months of 60.0%, 30.0%, and 3.3%, respectively.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: A randomised controlled trial was undertaken of HCC patients resistant to TACE with doxorubicin to assess the survival benefits of the experimental group (TACE with bleomycin) compared with the control group (TACE with doxorubicin). One hundred and seventy patients were allocated randomly between December 2015 and December 2017, and 80 patients of each group were analysed. The modified response evaluation criteria in solid tumours (mRECIST) was used to evaluated the tumour response every 4-6 weeks. The primary endpoint was median progression-free survival (mPFS) and median overall survival (mOS). Safety was assessed by post-procedure complications. RESULTS: The study was completed in October 2018. Objective response rate (ORR) of the experimental group was 27.5% (22/80), mPFS and mOS was 5.8 and 8.1 months. ORR of the control group was 7.5% (6/80), mPFS and mOS was 2.9 and 4 months. The ORR were significantly different between two groups (χ(2) = 0.348, p<0.05).

We aimed to determine whether TACE with sorafenib improves progression-free survival versus TACE with placebo. METHODS: We did a multicentre, randomised, placebo-controlled, phase 3 trial (TACE 2) in 20 hospitals in the UK for patients with unresectable, liver-confined hepatocellular carcinoma. Patients were eligible if they were at least aged 18 years, had Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 1 or less, and had Child-Pugh A liver disease. Patients were randomised 1:1 by computerised minimisation algorithm to continuous oral sorafenib (400 mg twice-daily) or matching placebo combined with TACE using drug-eluting beads (DEB-TACE), which was given via the hepatic artery 2-5 weeks after randomisation and according to radiological response and patient tolerance thereafter. Patients were stratified according to randomising centre and serum α-fetoprotein concentration (<400 ng/mL and ≥400 ng/mL). Only the trial coordinator was unmasked to treatment allocation before patient progression during the study. The primary endpoint was progression-free survival defined as the interval between randomisation and progression according to Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors version 1.1 (RECIST v1.1) or death due to any cause, and was analysed by intention-to-treat. Safety was analysed by intention-to-treat. The trial has been completed and the final results are reported. The trial is registered at EudraCT, number 2008-005073-36, and ISRCTN, number ISRCTN93375053. FINDINGS: Between Nov 4, 2010, and Dec 7, 2015, the trial enrolled 399 patients and was terminated after a planned interim futility analysis. 86 patients failed screening and 313 remaining patients were randomly assigned: 157 to sorafenib and 156 to placebo. The median daily dose was 660 mg (IQR 389·2-800·0) sorafenib versus 800 mg (758·2-800·0) placebo, and median duration of therapy was 120·0 days (IQR 43·0-266·0) for sorafenib versus 162·0 days (70·0-323·5) for placebo. There was no evidence of difference in progression-free survival between the sorafenib group and the placebo group (hazard ratio [HR] 0·99 [95% CI 0·77-1·27], p=0·94); median progression-free survival was 238·0 days (95% CI 221·0-281·0) in the sorafenib group and 235·0 days (209·0-322·0) in the placebo group. The most common grade 3-4 adverse events were fatigue (29 [18%] of 157 patients in the sorafenib group vs 21 [13%] of 156 patients in the placebo group), abdominal pain (20 [13%] vs 12 [8%]), diarrhoea (16 [10%] vs four [3%]), gastrointestinal disorders (18 [11%] vs 12 [8%]), and hand-foot skin reaction (12 [8%] and none). At least one serious adverse event was reported in 65 (41%) of 157 patients in the sorafenib group and 50 (32%) of 156 in the placebo group, and 181 serious adverse events were reported in total, 95 (52%) in the sorafenib group and 86 (48%) in the placebo group. Three deaths occurred in each group that were attributed to DEB-TACE. Four deaths were attributed to study drug; three in the sorafenib group and one in the placebo group. INTERPRETATION: The addition of sorafenib to DEB-TACE does not improve progression-free survival in European patients with hepatocellular carcinoma.

METHODS: In this prospective, randomized, single-center trial, patients were randomly assigned to receive TACE therapy with either lipiodol or DSM as the embolization agent. Therapy response was evaluated using MRI. Local tumor response was determined according to RECIST 1.1, and survival data was analyzed using the Kaplan-Meier estimator. RESULTS: Fifty patients (35 male, 15 female) were randomized and included in the survival analysis, whereas 31 patients completed therapy and were considered for evaluation of tumor responses (cTACE: n = 13, DSM-TACE: n = 18). In the cTACE group, PR was observed in 23%, SD in 15%, and PD in 62%. In the DSM-TACE-group, PR was observed in 22% of patients, SD in 56%, and PD in 22% (p = 0.047). In addition, the DSM-TACE group showed statistically significant tumor volume reduction (p = 0.006). Median apparent diffusion coefficient values were not significantly different between both groups at baseline (p = 0.26) and study endpoint (p = 0.83). Median survival in the cTACE group was 13 months (95% confidence interval, range 5-40 months) compared to 16 months (95% confidence interval, range 1-48 months) in the DSM-TACE group, exhibiting no statistically significant difference (p = 0.75). CONCLUSION: DSM-TACE showed a significant difference reducing tumor volume and in tumor response according to RECIST 1.1 compared to cTACE. Thus, patients with CRLM might not only benefit from short embolization effect of DSM-TACE but also from better tumor responses. Apparent diffusion coefficients were not significantly different between both groups and cannot be used as a biomarker for monitoring for therapeutic effect of TACE. KEY POINTS: • To our knowledge, this is the first prospective study that directly compared cTACE and DSM-TACE in patients with CRLM. • DSM-TACE showed a significant difference reducing tumor volume (p = 0.006) and in tumor response according to RECIST 1.1 (p = 0.047) compared to cTACE. • Survival analysis showed a median survival of 13 months in the cTACE group compared to 16 months in the DSM-TACE group (p = 0.75).",Vogl TJ; Marko C; Langenbach MC; Naguib NNN; Filmann N; Hammerstingl R; Gruber-Rouh T,False,"Population is CRLM, not hepatocellular carcinoma; intervention is not ICIs.",patients with CRLM,TACE with DSM or lipiodol,TACE with lipiodol vs DSM,tumor response and survival rate,"prospective, randomized, single-center trial",False,"Model A correctly identified that the population is CRLM, not HCC, and the intervention is TACE with DSM or lipiodol, not ICIs.

133,Transradial versus transfemoral access without closure device for transarterial chemoembolization in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma: a randomized trial.,10.1007/s00330-022-09038-1,"OBJECTIVES: To compare patient satisfaction, procedural variables, and safety with transradial access (TRA) and transfemoral access (TFA) in patients undergoing transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). MATERIALS AND METHODS: From February 2019 to August 2021, 130 patients undergoing TACE for HCC were randomly allocated to the TRA (n = 65) or TFA (n = 65) group. Vascular closure devices were not used after TFA-TACE. All patients completed the post-catheterization questionnaire and 8-item Short-Form Health Survey 1 day after TACE. RESULTS: Technical success rate, crossover rate, contrast agent dose, fluoroscopy time, procedure time, air kerma, dose-area product, length of hospital stay, and total cost were similar between the two groups (all p > 0.05). The incidence and severity of adverse events were also similar between the two groups (all p > 0.05). However, overall discomfort, difficulty going to the bathroom, difficulty feeding or self-caring, difficulty walking, general health, physical function, role physical function, social function, mental health, and role emotional function were better in the TRA group than in the TFA group (all p < 0.001). Consequently, more patients preferred the current access for their next procedure in the TRA group than in the TFA group (90.8% vs. 24.6%; p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: In patients undergoing TACE for HCC, using TRA instead of TFA can improve patient satisfaction without compromising procedural variables and safety. KEY POINTS: • Transradial access (TRA) enabled early ambulation after transarterial chemoembolization (TACE), resulting in significant increase in activities of daily living and health-related quality of life (HRQoL) compared to transfemoral access (TFA) when vascular closure devices were not used. • Procedural variables (contrast agent dose, fluoroscopy time, procedure time, air kerma, dose-area product, length of hospital stay, and total cost) were not significantly different between patients who received TRA-TACE and TFA-TACE. • The incidence and severity of adverse events were similar between patients who received TRA-TACE and TFA-TACE.",Zhang X; Luo Y; Tsauo J; Zhao H; Gong T; Li J; Li Y; Zeng H; Sun W; Li X,False,"Intervention is TRA/TFA, not ICIs; outcomes are not survival or response rate.",patients with HCC,TRA vs TFA for TACE,TRA vs TFA,"patient satisfaction, procedural variables, safety",randomized trial,False,"Model A correctly identified that the intervention is TRA/TFA for TACE, not ICIs, and the outcomes are patient satisfaction and procedural variables, not survival or response rate.

134,Efficacy comparison of optimal treatments for hepatocellular carcinoma patients with portal vein tumor thrombus.,10.1016/j.aohep.2021.100552,"INTRODUCTION AND OBJECTIVES: Optimal treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) involving portal vein tumor thrombus (PVTT) remains controversial. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 627 HCC patients with PVTT after initial treatment with one of the following at Affiliated Tumor Hospital of Guangxi Medical University: liver resection (LR, n = 225), transarterial chemoembolization (TACE, n = 298) or sorafenib (n = 104) were recruited and randomly divided into the training cohort (n = 314) and internal validation cohort (n = 313). Survival analysis were repeated after stratifying patients by Cheng PVTT type. RESULTS: Resection led to significantly higher OS than the other two treatments among patients with type I or II PVTT. TACE worked significantly better than the other two treatments for patients with type III. All three treatments were associated with similar OS among patients with type IV. These findings were supported by the internal validation cohort. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that the optimal treatment for HCC involving PVTT depends on the type of PVTT. LR may be more appropriate for type I or II PVTT; TACE, for type III Sorafenib may be more appropriate than invasive treatments for patients with type IV PVTT. S.L.U.

135,Role of lamivudine with transarterial chemoembolization in the survival of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma.,,"BACKGROUND AND AIM: The purpose of the present study was to determine whether lamivudine in combination with transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) could reduce hepatitis B virus (HBV) activation and improve the survival of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). METHODS: From July 2008 to October 2011, a total of 181 consecutive HBV-related HCC patients undergoing TACE were randomized to two groups (92: lamivudine, 89: control). Follow up was every 3 months. Primary and secondary end-points were time to progression (TTP) and overall survival (OS), respectively, both of which were evaluated by the Kaplan Meier technique and summarized by the hazard ratio. RESULTS: The level of HBV-DNA became undetectable in 42 (45.6%) patients in the lamivudine group, compared with 10 (11.2%) in the control group (P < 0.001). The median TTP was 8.2 months in lamivudine group and 4.3 months in control group (P = 0.005), and lamivudine therapy was an independent protective factor related to TTP (P = 0.006). Moreover, 1-, 2-, and 3-year survival rates were 83%, 69%, and 58% in lamivudine group and 60%, 48%, and 48% in control group, respectively (P = 0.002). With multivariate Cox regression model, lamivudine therapy (P = 0.002) and α-fetoprotein (AFP) level (P = 0.003) were two independent predictors for OS. CONCLUSION: Lamivudine therapy could reduce HBV activation and improve survival of HCC patients treated with TACE.

We investigated the addition of gemcitabine and oxaliplatin (GEMOX) to sorafenib in aHCC patients. METHODS: Our multicentre phase II trial randomised aHCC first-line patients to sorafenib (400 mg BID) or sorafenib-GEMOX every 2 weeks (1000 mg/m(2) gemcitabine; 100 mg/m(2) oxaliplatin). Primary endpoint was the 4-month progression-free survival (PFS) rate. RESULTS: Ninety-four patients were randomised (sorafenib-GEMOX: n = 48; sorafenib: n = 46). Median age was 64 years, PS 0 (69%) or 1 (31%), 63% patients had cirrhosis, 29% portal vein thrombosis and 70% extra-hepatic disease. Median duration of sorafenib treatment was 4 months (1-51); median number of GEMOX cycles was 7 (1-16). The 4-month PFS rates were 64% and 61% in the sorafenib-GEMOX and sorafenib arms, respectively; median PFS and OS were 6.2 (95% CI: 3.8-6.8) and 13.5 (7.5-16.2) months, and 4.6 (3.9-6.2) months and 14.8 (12.2-22.2), respectively. The ORR/DCR were 9%/70% and 15%/77% in the sorafenib-GEMOX and sorafenib alone arms, respectively. Main toxicities were (sorafenib-GEMOX/sorafenib) neutropenia (23%/0), thrombocytopenia (33%/0), diarrhoea (18%/9), peripheral neuropathy (5%/0) and hand-foot syndrome (5%/18).

137,Unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma: randomized controlled trial of transarterial ethanol ablation versus transcatheter arterial chemoembolization.,10.1148/radiol.13130498,"PURPOSE: To compare effectiveness of transarterial ethanol ablation (TEA) and transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (TACE) for unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma and determine whether TEA leads to better overall survival and tumor response than TACE. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this institutional review board-approved preregistered randomized controlled trial (n = 200), informed consent was obtained. Primary outcome was overall survival; secondary outcomes were time to progression (TTP), progression-free survival (PFS), tumor response at computed tomography, and treatment-related toxicity. Eligible patients were randomized at a 1:1 ratio. Treatment included transcatheter delivery of ethiodized oil-ethanol mixture (2:1 ratio by volume up to 60 mL) for TEA and cisplatin-ethiodized oil emulsion (0.5 mg cisplatin per milliliter up to 30 mg), followed by 1-mm gelatin-sponge pellets, for TACE. Study was terminated after interim analysis (n = 98); 90 patients were available for analysis. Overall survival, TTP, and PFS were analyzed with Kaplan-Meier method; differences were compared with log-rank test. RESULTS: Study was terminated prematurely after interim analysis, which showed no difference in overall survival; this was unlikely to change with further patient accrual. Median overall survival in TEA and TACE was 24.3 months (95% confidence interval [CI]: 12.8, 32.7) and 20.1 months (95% CI: 9.3, 31.2), respectively (P = .358). Median TTP and PFS for intralesional progression were longer with TEA than TACE (TTP, 34.6 months [95% CI: 28.2, 41] vs 26.05 months [95% CI: 18.7, 33.3]; PFS, 14.8 months [95% CI: 10.2, 19.5] vs 9.3 months [95% CI: 7.1, 11.5]) (P = .028 and 0.029, respectively).

138,Ramucirumab in elderly patients with hepatocellular carcinoma and elevated alpha-fetoprotein after sorafenib in REACH and REACH-2.,10.1111/liv.14462,"BACKGROUND & AIMS: Limited data on treatment of elderly patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) increase the unmet need. REACH and REACH-2 were global phase III studies of ramucirumab in patients with HCC after prior sorafenib, where patients with alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) ≥400 ng/mL showed an overall ssurvival (OS) benefit for ramucirumab. These post-hoc analyses examined efficacy and safety of ramucirumab in patients with HCC and baseline AFP ≥ 400 ng/mL by three prespecified age subgroups (<65, ≥65 to <75 and ≥75 years). METHODS: Individual patient data were pooled from REACH (baseline AFP ≥400 ng/mL) and REACH-2. Kaplan-Meier and Cox proportional hazards regression methods (stratified by study) assessed OS, progression-free survival (PFS), time to progression (TTP) and patient-reported outcomes (Functional Hepatobiliary System Index-8 [FHSI-8] score). RESULTS: A total of 542 patients (<65 years: n = 302; ≥65 to <75 years: n = 160; ≥75 years: n = 80) showed similar baseline characteristics between ramucirumab and placebo. Older subgroups had higher hepatitis C and steatohepatitis incidences, and lower AFP levels, than the <65 years subgroup. Ramucirumab prolonged OS in patients <65 years (hazard ratio [HR], 0.753; 95% CI 0.581-0.975), ≥65 to <75 years (0.602; 0.419-0.866) and ≥75 years (0.709; 0.420-1.199), PFS and TTP irrespective of age. Ramucirumab showed similar overall safety profiles across subgroups, with a consistent median relative dose intensity ≥97.8%. A trend towards a delay in symptom deterioration in FHSI-8 with ramucirumab was observed in all subgroups.

139,Construction and Validation of Prediction Model of Severe Abdominal Pain Post-Transarterial Chemoembolization in Patients with HBV-Associated Primary Liver Cancer.,10.1155/2022/5203166,"OBJECTIVE: This study is aimed at constructing and evaluating a prediction model of severe abdominal pain post-transcatheter arterial chemoembolization in patients with HBV-related primary liver cancer. METHODS: Patients with HBV-associated primary liver cancer who received transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) from March 2019 to March 2022 in the Interventional Therapy Department of our hospital were selected as the subjects, and the included 160 patients were randomly divided into modeling group (n = 120) and validation group (n = 40) in a ratio of 3 : 1. Visual analog scale (VAS) was used to assess pain severity. 120 patients in the modeling group were divided into no/mild abdominal pain group and severe abdominal pain group. The clinical data of the patients, including gender, age, TACE treatment history, vascular invasion, maximum diameter of tumor, infarction degree, preoperative Eastern Oncology Collaboration Group (ECOG) score, and Lipiodol dosage, were analyzed. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was used to evaluate the predictive value of the prediction model for severe abdominal pain post-TACE. RESULTS: A total of 116 patients (72.50%) had severe abdominal pain after TACE. Univariate analysis showed that severe abdominal pain after TACE in the modeling group was associated with TACE treatment history, maximum tumor diameter, infarction degree, and preoperative ECOG score (all P < 0.05), but not related to gender, age, vascular invasion, and Lipiodol dosage (all P > 0.05). Logistic regression analysis showed that TACE treatment history, maximum tumor diameter, infarction degree, and preoperative ECOG score were all independent influencing factors for acute abdominal pain post-TACE in HBV-HCC patients (all P < 0.05). The prediction model equation was Y = -3.673 + 1.722 × TACE treatment history + 1.175 × tumor maximum diameter + 2.064 × infarction degree + 1.555 × preoperative ECOG score. Goodness-of-fit test results showed no significant difference between the established prediction model and the observed value (χ (2) = 1.645, P = 0.560) and R (2) = 0.821, suggesting that the prediction ability of the model was relatively accurate. ROC analysis results showed that the area under the curve (AUC) of severe abdominal pain after TACE was 0.916 (0.862~0.970) and 0.902 (95% CI: 0.841~0.963) in the modeling group and the verification group, respectively.

This trial was conducted to evaluate the effect of addition of hepatic arterial infusion chemotherapy with cisplatin (SorCDDP) to Sor for the treatment of advanced HCC. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We conducted a multicenter open-labeled randomized phase II trial in chemo-naïve patients with advanced HCC with Child-Pugh scores of 5-7. Eligible patients were randomly assigned 2:1 to receive SorCDDP (sorafenib: 400 mg bid; cisplatin: 65 mg/m(2), day 1, every 4-6 weeks) or Sor (400 mg bid). The primary end point was overall survival. RESULTS: A total of 108 patients were randomized (Sor, n = 42; SorCDDP, n = 66). The median survival in the Sor and SorCDDP arms were 8.7 and 10.6 months, respectively [stratified hazard ratio (95% confidence interval), 0.60 (0.38-0.96), P = 0.031]. The median time to progression and the response rate were, respectively, 2.8 months and 7.3% in the Sor arm and 3.1 months and 21.7% in the SorCDDP arm. The adverse events were more frequent in the SorCDDP arm than in the Sor arm, but well-tolerated.

141,Predictive value of hepatic venous pressure gradient and efficacy and significance of early PTVE for gastrointestinal bleeding after TACE for liver cancer.,10.4103/jcrt.jcrt_331_22,"AIMS: To investigate the predictive value of hepatic venous pressure gradient (HVPG) and the efficacy and significance of early percutaneous transhepatic varices embolization (PTVE) for gastrointestinal bleeding after transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (TACE) for liver cancer. METHODS AND MATERIALS: This retrospective study enrolled 60 patients diagnosed with stage B or stage C liver cancer, according to the Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC) staging system, between December 2019 and October 2021. TACE and HVPG measurement (>16 mmHg or >20 mmHg) were performed on all 60 patients, who were randomized into control and experimental (PTVE) groups. All patients were followed up for 12 months. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS USED: SPSS 20.0 software was used for data analysis. The two groups were compared with respect to the initial occurrence time of hemorrhage after TACE, recurrence time of hemorrhage, liver function, TACE frequency, TACE type, and tumor control. RESULTS: The initial hemorrhage rates at one, three, six, and 12 months after TACE were 3.2%, 12.9%, 22.6%, and 48.4%, respectively, in the control group (n = 31) and 0%, 0%, 3.4%, and 10.3%, respectively, in the PTVE group (n = 29). Differences between the groups in terms of initial hemorrhage rate at six and 12 months postoperatively were significant (P < 0.05). The recurrence rates of hemorrhage at one, three, six, and 12 months after TACE were 11.1%, 22.2%, 22.2%, and 33.3%, respectively, in 27 patients in the control group. In eight patients in the PTVE group, the corresponding rates were 0%, 0%, 0%, and 25.0%. The differences between the groups in the recurrence rate of hemorrhage at the four time points were significant (P < 0.05). At six months postoperatively, liver function recovery and remission were noted in eight (25.8%) and 18 (66.7%) patients, respectively, in the control group; these events were noted in 10 (34.5%) and 19 patients (65.5%), respectively, in the PTVE group, and the difference between the groups was not significant (P > 0.05). In the control group, TACE was performed for a total of 94 times on 31 patients within 12 months, including conventional transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (C-TACE, 75.5%) and the drug-eluting bead TACE (DEB-TACE, 24.5%); the objective response rate (ORR) was 39.3%. In the PTVE group, TACE was performed for a total of 151 times on 29 patients within 12 months, with an average of 5.21 times on each patient, including the C-TACE (57.6%) and DEB-TACE (42.4%); the ORR was 60.1%. Differences in TACE frequency, proportion of C-TACE/DEB-TACE, and ORR were significant between the two groups (P < 0.05).

142,Sorafenib combined with percutaneous radiofrequency ablation for the treatment of medium-sized hepatocellular carcinoma.,,"OBJECTIVE: Sorafenib, an oral multikinase inhibitor, is the proved therapy method for patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Based on heat delivery, Radiofrequency ablation (RFA) has been found to achieve complete neoplasm necrosis. It is the most widely performed percutaneous therapy for HCC. However, Study associated combined Sorafenib with RFA therapy for patients with advanced HCC has never been reported. The aim of present study is to explore the efficacy and safety of sorafenib combined with RFA therapy for the patients with medium-sized HCC. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 62 patients diagnosed as HCC were involved in this study. All patients were randomly assigned to sorafenib and RFA (n=30) or RFA-alone (n=32) treatment groups. Treatment outcomes, including recurrence rates, time to progression (TTP) and adverse reactions induced by sorafenib were observed and recorded to assess the efficacy and safety of the combination method. RESULTS: During the overall follow-up period, the recurrence rate of the combination subgroup was 56.7% (17/30), and that of the RFA-alone subgroup was 87.5% (28/32) (p < 0.01). The median TTP was 17.0 months in the combination therapy vs. 6.1 months in the RFA-alone (p < 0.05). Hand-foot skin reactions were reported by 83.3% (25/30) of patients and 46.7% (14/30) reported diarrhea while the most adverse events (AEs) were mild to moderate in the combination subgroup.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to linifanib 17.5 mg once daily or sorafenib 400 mg twice daily. Patients were stratified by region (Outside Asia, Japan, and rest of Asia), Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance score (ECOG PS; 0 or 1), vascular invasion or extrahepatic spread (yes or no), and hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection (yes or no). The primary end point of the study was overall survival (OS). Secondary end points were time to progression (TTP) and objective response rate (ORR) per RECIST v1.1. RESULTS: We randomly assigned 1,035 patients (median age, 60 years; Asian, 66.6%; ECOG PS 0, 65.2%; HBV, 49.1%; vascular invasion or extrahepatic spread, 70.1%). Median OS was 9.1 months on the linifanib arm (95% CI, 8.1 to 10.2) and 9.8 months on the sorafenib arm (95% CI, 8.3 to 11.0; hazard ratio [HR], 1.046; 95% CI, 0.896 to 1.221). For prespecified stratification subgroups, OS HRs ranged from 0.793 to 1.119 and the 95% CI contained 1.0.

METHODS: This study included randomised patients who received either TARE or at least one dose of sorafenib with no major deviation in the protocol and who had at least one QoL follow-up assessment in addition to the baseline evaluation. QoL was assessed from the date of randomisation using the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer QLQ-C30 questionnaire, until disease progression or other reasons for stopping study participation. Data were analysed using linear mixed and time-dependent models. RESULTS: A total of 285 patients were included (122 and 163, in the TARE and sorafenib groups, respectively). Questionnaire completion rates were similar (77.5% versus 80.4%, in the TARE and sorafenib groups, respectively, p = 0.25). Longitudinal HRQoL analysis showed a significant treatment and time effects for fatigue and global health status, and significant treatment, time and treatment by time interaction effects for appetite loss, diarrhoea and social functioning.

145,Association of adverse events and quality of life in patients with unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma.,10.1007/s11136-024-03779-w,"PURPOSE: Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the third-leading cause of cancer-related deaths globally. Patients are often diagnosed with advanced disease, in which systemic and locoregional therapies are commonly used as first-line treatment. Such treatments can cause adverse events (AEs) that negatively affect quality of life (QoL), which is particularly undesirable where prognosis is poor. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the impact of common AEs on QoL in patients with HCC. METHODS: Data from the SARAH randomized controlled trial (RCT) were analyzed. Given the large number of distinct AEs that occurred in the trial, AEs were grouped as in the SARAH trial and prioritized using principal component analysis (PCA). Linear mixed-effects models were then applied with age, ECOG status, and AEs as predictors of the QoL change as measured with the EORTC Core Quality of Life Questionnaire (QLQ-C30). RESULTS: The PCA resulted in the selection of 28 AEs for inclusion in the linear mixed-effects models. Of the 28 AEs, diarrhea, decreased appetite, abdominal pain, and palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia syndrome (hand-foot syndrome) were significant drivers of reductions in QoL as measured using the QLQ-C30 global health status scale. Diarrhea, abdominal pain, and hand-foot syndrome were also significant drivers of reduced QoL outcomes. CONCLUSION: The present analysis showed that diarrhea, decreased appetite, abdominal pain, and palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia were significantly associated with reduced QoL in patients with unresectable HCC. Reducing the incidence and/or severity of these AEs should therefore be a key focus when selecting the optimal treatments for these patients.",Agirrezabal I; Pollock RF; Carion PL; Shergill S; Brennan VK; Pereira H; Chatellier G; Vilgrain V,False,Intervention is not ICIs,patients with HCC,not specified,not specified,quality of life impact of adverse events,analysis of SARAH RCT data,False,"Model A correctly identified that the intervention is not ICIs.

The goal of this study is to compare the analgesic effect among celecoxib, parecoxib, and oxycodone in patients undergoing TACE. METHODS: This prospective study was a randomized, paralleled trial in which 213 patients were enrolled. Patients were assigned at the ratio of 1:1:1 to receive celecoxib, parecoxib, or controlled-release oxycodone 1 hour before TACE (T0) and once every 12 hours for 2 days after TACE. Pain scores, pain intensity, and adverse events in each time interval were evaluated and compared among the 3 groups. RESULTS: The mean pain score 12 hours after T0 in the parecoxib group (2.8) was lower than that in the celecoxib (4.4; P = .001) and oxycodone groups (4.2; P = .005). The number of patients suffering severe pain was 10 (14.7%) in the parecoxib, 25 (36.8%) in the celecoxib, and 23 (32.9%) in the oxycodone groups (P = .009). Twelve hours after T0, the incidence of grade 3 vomiting in the parecoxib group (2.9%) was significantly lower than that in the oxycodone group (17.1%; P = .006). In the multivariate analysis, nonparecoxib prophylactic analgesia (odds ratio [OR], 4.620; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.877-11.370; P = .001) as well as embolization of the gallbladder (OR, 8.666; 95% CI, 2.402-31.262; P = .001) and normal liver parenchyma (OR, 3.278; 95% CI, 1.409-7.627; P = .006) were the independent factors of severe pain intensity 12 hours after T0.

147,"S-1 versus placebo in patients with sorafenib-refractory advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (S-CUBE): a randomised, double-blind, multicentre, phase 3 trial.",10.1016/S2468-1253(17)30072-9,"BACKGROUND: Unresectable advanced hepatocellular carcinoma is a heterogeneous disease, for which sorafenib is the first targeted agent approved for first-line therapy, and treatment options for patients with sorafenib-refractory advanced hepatocellular carcinoma are limited. We assessed the efficacy and safety of S-1, a chemotherapeutic agent based on fluorouracil, in patients with sorafenib-refractory advanced hepatocellular carcinoma. METHODS: We did a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 3 study done at 57 sites in Japan. Patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma who were ineligible for surgical or local-regional therapy and judged refractory to sorafenib (ie, had progressed on sorafenib or had discontinued sorafenib because of adverse events) were randomly assigned (2:1) to receive oral S-1 (weight-banded 80 mg/m(2) [80-120 mg per day]), or placebo, twice per day for 28 days consecutively, followed by a minimum 14 day drug-free period. This cycle was repeated until disease progression or the patient became intolerant to the study treatment. Patients were stratified by site and presence or absence of extrahepatic metastasis or vascular invasion. The primary endpoint was overall survival, assessed in the full analysis set (ie, all patients who were treated with study drug except any individuals who were found not to have hepatocellular carcinoma or who were found to have active double cancer). Patients, medical staff, investigators, and the sponsor were masked to treatment assignment. Blinding was maintained even after study treatment concluded. This study is registered with JapicCTI, number JapicCTI-090920, and has been completed. FINDINGS: Between Oct 26, 2009, and Aug 22, 2012, we screened 399 patients. 65 patients were excluded due to not meeting criteria (n=61), declining to participate (n=3), or other reasons (n=1). 334 patients were randomly assigned to receive either S-1 (n=223) or placebo (n=111). One patient in the S-1 group did not receive treatment, and was thus excluded from analyses. At data cutoff, median follow-up was 32·4 months (IQR 24·0-34·7) in the S-1 group and 32·9 months (23·7-39·5) in the placebo group. Median overall survival was 11·1 months (95% CI 9·7-13·1) in the S-1 group and 11·2 months (9·2-12·8) in the placebo group (hazard ratio 0·86, 95% CI 0·67-1·10; p=0·220). The most frequently reported adverse events were skin hyperpigmentation (123 [55%] of 222 patients in the S-1 group vs nine [8%] of 111 patients in the placebo group), decreased appetite (104 [47%] vs 21 [19%]), fatigue (102 [46%] vs 20 [18%]), diarrhoea (77 [35%] vs 14 [13%]), and increased blood bilirubin (77 [35%] vs 14 [13%]). Serious adverse events were reported in 90 (41%) of 222 patients in the S-1 group and 24 (22%) of 111 patients in the placebo group. Five treatment-related deaths were reported in the S-1 group.

148,Prognostic Significance of VEGF and HIF-1 α in Hepatocellular Carcinoma Patients Receiving Sorafenib Versus Metformin Sorafenib Combination.,10.1007/s12029-020-00389-w,"BACKGROUND: Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a major health problem. HCC burden has been increasing in Egypt in the past 10 years. Most HCC cases are diagnosed at an advanced stage with limited treatment options. Sorafenib is the standard therapy for advanced HCC, but the effectiveness is not satisfied. Metformin may decrease the risk of HCC development in diabetic patients, reduces tumor invasion, and augments sensitivity to sorafenib; however, safety and efficacy of combined treatment are still unclear. As HCC is characterized by high vascularity, and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) plays an important role in vascularization, many studies questioned if VEGF and HIF-1 α could offer information about HCC response to sorafenib. We conducted this study to assess the benefits from adding metformin to HCC treatment, and appraise the role of VEGF and HIF-1 α in HCC prognosis. METHOD: This was a prospective, randomized study in which 80 advanced measurable patients consecutively treated with sorafenib plus metformin (arm A) or sorafenib alone (arm B), prognostic value of plasma, and tissue levels of VEGF and HIF-1 α were evaluated. RESULTS: We enrolled 61 men and 19 women with a median age of 60 years (range 49-68 years). Fifty-seven patients had Child-Pugh A while 23 had early B, the most common etiology of liver disease was hepatitis C (86%). Sixty percent of patients were diabetic. No significant difference was detected between arm A and arm B regarding response to treatment (p = 0.5), time to disease progression (p = 0.3), or overall survival (p = 0.6). Low VEGF and HIF-1 α plasma levels were significantly associated with better treatment response (p < 0.001 for both), and higher OS (p < 0.001). Patients with high expressions of VEGF and HIF in HCC tissue had significantly poor treatment outcome (p < 0.001, p = 0.03, respectively), and poor OS (p < 0.001, p < 0.001, respectively).

149,Baseline Interleukin-6 and -8 predict response and survival in patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma treated with sorafenib monotherapy: an exploratory post hoc analysis of the SORAMIC trial.,10.1007/s00432-021-03627-1,"PURPOSE: To explore the potential correlation between baseline interleukin (IL) values and overall survival or objective response in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) receiving sorafenib. METHODS: A subset of patients with HCC undergoing sorafenib monotherapy within a prospective multicenter phase II trial (SORAMIC, sorafenib treatment alone vs. combined with Y90 radioembolization) underwent baseline IL-6 and IL-8 assessment before treatment initiation. In this exploratory post hoc analysis, the best cut-off points for baseline IL-6 and IL-8 values predicting overall survival (OS) were evaluated, as well as correlation with the objective response. RESULTS: Forty-seven patients (43 male) with a median OS of 13.8 months were analyzed. Cut-off values of 8.58 and 57.9 pg/mL most effectively predicted overall survival for IL-6 and IL-8, respectively. Patients with high IL-6 (HR, 4.1 [1.9-8.9], p < 0.001) and IL-8 (HR, 2.4 [1.2-4.7], p = 0.009) had significantly shorter overall survival than patients with low IL values. Multivariate analysis confirmed IL-6 (HR, 2.99 [1.22-7.3], p = 0.017) and IL-8 (HR, 2.19 [1.02-4.7], p = 0.044) as independent predictors of OS.

Conventional TACE (c-TACE) and drug-eluting microspheres TACE (DEM-TACE) are available intraarterial therapies. Screening of patients with cirrhosis is of great importance for early detection of malignant liver nodules. Primary endpoint of this study was to compare DEM-TACE with c-TACE in terms of 12- and 24-month survival. Secondary endpoints were comparison of intensity and duration of the postembolization syndrome (PES) and severe adverse events. We randomized 60 patients with unresectable HCC one-to-one with c-TACE or DEM-TACE and followed them for at least 24 months or until death. TACE was repeated 'on-demand. Most patients underwent two TACE sessions and the median hospital stay was 3 days for c-TACE and 2 days for DEM-TACE group.

Methods: 56 patients who underwent TACE in our hospital from March 2022 to March 2023 were selected as the study subjects. The patients were randomly divided into a control group (28 cases) and an intervention group (28 cases). The control group received routine dietary intervention, while the intervention group received individualized nutritional intervention. We analyzed the body mass index (BMI), nutritional risk screening 2002 (NRS 2002), nutritional status, liver function status, and incidence of complications in two groups of patients before TACE, 3 days after TACE, and 1 month after TACE. Results: on the third day after TACE, the nutritional related indicators of both groups of patients showed a significantly decrease compared to those before TACE (p < 0.05), while the majority of liver function indicators significantly increased (p < 0.05). Compared with those at 3 days after TACE, the nutritional status of the intervention group patients significantly improved (p < 0.05) and liver function indicators significantly decreased (p < 0.05) 1 month after TACE. One month after TACE, all nutritional indicators in the intervention group were significantly higher than those in the control group (p < 0.05), and AST was significantly lower than that in the control group (p < 0.05). The incidence of gastrointestinal complications and electrolyte disorders in the intervention group were significantly lower than that in the control group (p < 0.05).

METHODS: This RCT was conducted on 173 patients with RMHCC outside of Milan Criteria (a solitary tumor up to 5 cm or multiple tumors up to 3 in number and up to 3 cm for each tumor) who were treated in our centre from November 2008 to September 2010. The patients were randomly assigned to the PH group or the TACE group. The primary outcome measure was overall survival (OS) from the date of treatment. A multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression analysis was performed to assess the prognostic risk factors associated with OS. RESULTS: The 1-, 2-, and 3-year OS rates were 76.1%, 63.5%, and 51.5%, respectively, for the PH group compared with 51.8%, 34.8%, and 18.1%, respectively, for the TACE group (Log-rank test, χ(2)=24.246, p<0.001). Multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression analysis revealed the type of treatment (hazard ratio, 0.434; 95% CI, 0.293 to 0.644, p<0.001), number of tumor (hazard ratio, 1.758; 95% CI, 1.213 to 2.548, p=0.003) and gender (hazard ratio, 0.451; 95% CI, 0.236 to 0.862, p=0.016) were significant independent risk factors associated with OS.

Patients with unresectable HCC, Child-Pugh ≤B7, ECOG performance status ≤2 and ≤5 liver lesions (≤20 cm total maximum diameter) without extrahepatic spread were randomized to receive either TACE (at 6-weekly intervals until tumour enhancement was not observed on MRI or disease progression) or single-session SIRT (yttrium-90 resin microspheres). RESULTS: Twenty-eight patients with BCLC stage A (32.1%), B (46.4%) or C (21.4%) received either a mean of 3.4 (median 2) TACE interventions (N = 15) or single SIRT (N = 13). Both treatments were well tolerated. Despite SIRT patients having significantly worse physical functioning at baseline, at week-12, neither treatment had a significantly different impact on HRQoL as measured by Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Hepatobiliary total or its subscales. Both TACE and SIRT were effective for the local control of liver tumours. Best overall response-rate (RECIST 1.0) of target lesions were 13.3% and 30.8%, disease control rates were 73.3% and 76.9% for TACE and SIRT, respectively. Two patients in each group were down-staged for liver transplantation (N = 3) or radiofrequency ablation (N = 1). CONCLUSIONS: Single-session SIRT appeared to be as safe and had a similar impact on HRQoL as multiple sessions of TACE, suggesting that SIRT might be an alternative option for patients eligible for TACE.",Kolligs FT; Bilbao JI; Jakobs T; Iñarrairaegui M; Nagel JM; Rodriguez M; Haug A; D'Avola D; op den Winkel M; Martinez-Cuesta A; Trumm C; Benito A; Tatsch K; Zech CJ; Hoffmann RT; Sangro B,False,Intervention is not immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs),patients with unresectable HCC,SIRT,TACE,safety and health-related quality of life,randomized-controlled pilot study,False,"Model A correctly identified that the intervention is not ICIs.

METHODS: Patients were randomly allocated to the CBATO-TACE group and the conventional transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (cTACE) group. The primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS). The secondary endpoint was overall survival (OS), treatment response, and treatment-related adverse events (TRAEs). The extrahepatic collateral arteries, liver function, and liver fibrosis after the first TACE were also evaluated. RESULTS: From September 2018 to September 2020, a total of 207 patients who underwent TACE were consecutively enrolled in this study. The median PFS was 9.5 months (range: 8.0 - 11.0) in the CBATO group, which was significantly longer than that in the cTACE group (6.0 months, range: 4.0-6.0) (p < 0.0001). Patients in the CBATO group had a median OS of 22 months (range: 20.0 - 27.0) compared with 16 months (range: 15.0 - 20.0) in the cTACE group (p = 0.0084). The most common TRAEs were fever (p = 0.043), and nausea and vomiting (p = 0.002), which were more observed in the cTACE group. In addition, the progressive disease time, pulmonary metastasis rate (p = 0.01), the mean number of extrahepatic collateral arteries (p = 0.01), and average number of TACE sessions (p = 0.025) were significantly decreased in the CBATO group. CONCLUSIONS: CBATO-TACE achieved better therapeutic outcomes and similar safety profile compared to cTACE in large or huge HCC patients. Furthermore, CBATO-TACE was able to reduce extrahepatic collateral arteries production and extrahepatic lung metastasis. CLINICAL RELEVANCE STATEMENT: Our study showed that CalliSpheres® beads loaded with arsenic trioxide (CBATO-TACE) were effective and safe for the treatment of large and giant HCC. In addition, CBATO-TACE can reduce lateral hepatic branch artery formation and extrahepatic pulmonary metastasis, which provides a new treatment approach for unresectable HCC. KEY POINTS: • We compare long-term efficacy and safety of transcatheter arterial chemoembolization with CalliSpheres® beads loaded with arsenic trioxide (CBATO-TACE) and conventional transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (cTACE) in patients with large (5 cm ≤ maximum diameter < 10 cm) or huge HCC (maximum diameter ≥ 10 cm). • Compared with cTACE, CBATO-TACE significantly improved therapeutic outcomes, overall survival, and progression-free survival in patients with large or huge HCC. The safety assessment suggested that CBATO-TACE is a safe treatment that improves the quality of life and has good treatment adherence.",Duan X; Li H; Chen P; Sun T; Kuang D; Lu H; Qiao B; Fan Z; Ren Z; Han X,False,Intervention is not immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs),patients with large or huge HCC,CBATO-TACE,cTACE,progression-free survival and overall survival,randomized trial,False,"Model A correctly identified that the intervention is not ICIs.

METHODS: Seventy-seven patients were treated after randomization to iBT or cTACE, as single or repeated interventions. Crossover was allowed if clinically indicated. The primary endpoint was time to untreatable progression (TTUP). Eligibility criteria included a Child-Pugh score of ≤ 8 points, absence of portal vein thrombosis (PVT) at the affected liver lobe, and ≤ 4 lesions. Survival was analyzed by using the Cox proportional hazard model with stratification for Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC) stages. RESULTS: Twenty patients were classified as BCLC-A (iBT/cTACE 8/12), 35 as BCLC-B (16/19), and 22 as BCLC-C (13/9). The 1-, 2-, and 3-year TTUP probabilities for iBT compared with cTACE were 67.5% versus 55.2%, 56.0% versus 27.4%, and 29.5% versus 11.0%, respectively, with an adjusted hazard ratio (HR) of 0.49 (95% confidence interval 0.27-0.89; p = 0.019).

158,Regorafenib treatment for patients with hepatocellular carcinoma who progressed on sorafenib-A cost-effectiveness analysis.,10.1371/journal.pone.0207132,"BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the leading causes of cancer related deaths. Patients with advanced HCC are treated with sorafenib. A recent randomized controlled trial demonstrated a survival benefit for regorafenib treatment in patients with advanced HCC who had progressed on sorafenib. We aimed to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of this approach. METHODS: To evaluate the cost effectiveness of regorafenib, we used a Markov model that incorporates health outcomes, measured by life-years and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs). Drug costs were based on 2017 discounted prices. Model robustness was validated by probabilistic sensitivity analyses using Monte Carlo simulations. RESULTS: The use of regorafenib results in a gain of 19.76 weeks of life (0.38 Life Years) as compared to placebo. When adjusted for quality of life, using regorafenib produced a gain of 0.25 quality adjusted life years (QALYs). The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio for regorafenib compared with best supportive care was between $201,797 and $268,506 per QALY. CONCLUSION: The modest incremental benefit at a relatively high incremental cost of regorafenib treatment suggests that it is not cost-effective at commonly accepted willingness to pay thresholds.",Shlomai A; Leshno M; Goldstein DA,False,Intervention is not immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs),patients with advanced HCC,regorafenib,placebo,cost-effectiveness and survival,randomized controlled trial,False,"Model A correctly identified that the intervention is not ICIs.

159,Atezolizumab and bevacizumab combination compared with sorafenib as the first-line systemic treatment for patients with unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma: A cost-effectiveness analysis in China and the United states.,10.1111/liv.14795,"BACKGROUND & AIMS: In patients with unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), the combination of atezolizumab and bevacizumab improved progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival compared with sorafenib in the IMbrave150 trial. However, whether the price of the combination could be affordable is unknown. The current study assessed the cost-effectiveness of the combination of atezolizumab and bevacizumab as first-line systemic therapy for patients with unresectable HCC from the Chinese and American payers' perspective. METHODS: A Markov model was built based on a global, multicentre, open-label, phase III randomized trial (IMbrave150, NCT03434379) that included three states of the patient's health: stable disease (SD), progressive disease (PD) and death. Data for all medical costs were acquired from the Red Book, published literature and West China Hospital. Quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) were the primary outcomes. Sensitivity analyses were performed to evaluate the model uncertainty. RESULTS: The treatment consisting of a combination of atezolizumab and bevacizumab yielded an additional 0.53 QALYs compared with sorafenib alone, leading to an ICER of $145,546.21 per QALY in China and $168,030.21 per QALY in the USA, both beyond the willing-to-pay threshold ($28,527.00/QALY in China and $150,000.00 /QALY in the USA). The utility of the PD state was the most influential factor in the Chinese model, and the American model was the most sensitive to the price of sorafenib. The results of the models were robust across sensitivity analyses.

160,"Phase 2 trial comparing sorafenib, pravastatin, their combination or supportive care in HCC with Child-Pugh B cirrhosis.",10.1007/s12072-020-10120-3,"BACKGROUND AND AIMS: There is limited data regarding the role for systemic treatment in patients with Hepatocellular Carcinoma with Child-Pugh B cirrhosis. METHODS: PRODIGE 21 was a multicentric prospective non-comparative randomized trial. Patients were randomized to receive sorafenib (Arm A), pravastatin (Arm B), sorafenib-pravastatin (Arm C) combination, or best supportive care (Arm D). Primary endpoint was time to progression (TTP), secondary endpoints included safety and overall survival (OS). RESULTS: 160 patients were randomized and 157 patients were included in the final analysis. 86% of patients were BCLC C and 55% had macrovascular invasion. The safety profiles of the drugs were as expected. Median TTP was 3.5, 2.8, 2.0 and 2.2 months in arms A, B, C and D, respectively, but analysis was limited by the number of patients deceased without radiological progression (59%). Median OS was similar between the four arms: 3.8 [95% CI: 2.4-6.5], 3.1 [95% CI: 1.9-4.3], 4.0 [95% CI: 3.2-5.5] and 3.5 months [95% CI: 2.2-5.4] in arms A, B, C and D, respectively. Median OS was 4.0 months [95% CI: 3.3-5.5] for patients treated with sorafenib, vs 2.9 months [95% CI: 2.2-3.9] for patients not treated with sorafenib. In patients with ALBI grade 1/2, median OS was 6.1 months [95% CI: 3.8-8.3] in patients treated with sorafenib vs 3.1 months [95% CI: 1.9-4.8] for patients not treated with sorafenib. CONCLUSION: In the overall Child-Pugh B population, neither sorafenib nor pravastatin seemed to provide benefit.

An effective prophylactic dermatological cream for preventing sorafenib-induced hand-foot skin reaction (HFSR) is yet to be identified. AIM: The aim of this study is validated the prophylactic efficacy of urea-based creams on sorafenib-induced hand-foot skin reaction in patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma. METHODS: This was a randomised double-blind experimental study. A total of 129 patients with advanced HCC were randomly assigned to three groups. The comparison group received best supportive care (BSC), group A received BSC plus a moisturising cream, and group B received BSC plus a 10% urea-based cream. Incidence of HFSR and cutaneous wetness were assessed 3 days before starting sorafenib and each week after starting sorafenib for 8 weeks. RESULTS: No significant difference was observed in the incidence density of sorafenib-induced HFSK (comparison group/A group, p > .05; comparison group/B group, p > .05). Group B reported significantly better cutaneous wetness of hands in the seventh week after starting sorafenib (p < .05) and of feet during the first 6 weeks (p < .05-.001). CONCLUSION: This study found a nut size amount of a 10% urea-based cream applied twice a day can maintain patients' cutaneous wetness in the first 6 weeks after starting sorafenib than moisturising-alone cream. But it cannot reduce the occurrence of HFSR. Thus, the result supports nut-size dose of the 10% urea-based cream three times a day may be an appropriate dose to prevent HFSR.

162,Phase II Study of First-Line Trebananib Plus Sorafenib in Patients with Advanced Hepatocellular Carcinoma.,10.1634/theoncologist.2017-0058,"LESSONS LEARNED: Trebananib leveraging anti-angiogenic mechanism that is distinct from the classic sorafenib anti-vascular endothelial growth factor inhibition did not demonstrate improved progression-free survival at 4 months in patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).In support of previously reported high Ang-2 levels' association with poor outcome in HCC for patients, trebananib treatment with lower baseline Ang-2 at study entry was associated with improved overall survival to 22 months and may suggest future studies to be performed within the context of low baseline Ang-2. BACKGROUND: Ang-1 and Ang-2 are angiopoietins thought to promote neovascularization via activation of the Tie-2 angiopoietin receptor. Trebananib sequesters Ang-1 and Ang-2, preventing interaction with the Tie-2 receptor. Trebananib plus sorafenib combination has acceptable toxicity. Elevated Ang-2 levels are associated with poor prognosis in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). METHODS: Patients with HCC, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ≤2, and Childs-Pugh A received IV trebananib at 10 mg/kg or 15 mg/kg weekly plus sorafenib 400 mg orally twice daily. The study was planned for ≥78% progression-free survival (PFS) rate at 4 months relative to 62% for sorafenib historical control (power = 80% α = 0.20). Secondary endpoints included safety, tolerability, overall survival (OS), and multiple biomarkers, including serum Ang-2. RESULTS: Thirty patients were enrolled sequentially in each of the two nonrandomized cohorts. Demographics were comparable between the two arms and the historical controls. PFS rates at 4 months were 57% and 54% on the 10 mg/kg and 15 mg/kg trebananib cohorts, respectively. Median OS was 17 and 11 months, respectively. Grade 3 and above events noted in ≥10% of patients included fatigue, hypertension, diarrhea, liver failure, palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia syndrome, dyspnea, and hypophosphatemia. One death was due to hepatic failure. Serum Ang-2 dichotomized at the median was associated with improved OS in both cohorts. CONCLUSION: There was no improvement in PFS rate at 4 months in either cohort, when compared with sorafenib historical control. property of the authors.",Abou-Alfa GK; Blanc JF; Miles S; Ganten T; Trojan J; Cebon J; Liem AK; Lipton L; Gupta C; Wu B; Bass M; Hollywood E; Ma J; Bradley M; Litten J; Saltz LB,False,Intervention does not match ICIs; study design is not CheckMate RCT,patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma,trebananib plus sorafenib,historical control (sorafenib),"progression-free survival, overall survival",nonrandomized cohorts,False,"Model A correctly identified that the intervention does not match ICIs and the study design is not a CheckMate RCT.

METHODS: Forty-five patients with hepatocellular carcinoma were imaged with multiphase gadobenate dimeglumine-enhanced MR examination at baseline and 1-month follow-up after TACE. Nodule size, enhancement, and apparent diffusion coefficient were measured for both examinations by 2 reviewers. Changes in tumor nodule size, enhancement, and apparent diffusion coefficient were evaluated using the Student t test. RESULTS: Nineteen of 45 patients completed the study, and a total of 34 hepatocellular carcinoma nodules were analyzed. On the posttreatment follow up, there was no significant change in nodule size. Target lesions demonstrated significant decrease in tumor enhancement after TACE (P < 0.001).

METHODS: A randomized controlled trial (RCT) was conducted with 144 patients, who were randomly assigned to receive either DEB-TACE with doxorubicin-loaded CalliSpheres(®) microspheres or cTACE with doxorubicin-lipiodol emulsion. Patients were followed up for 12 months, with assessments at 3 and 12 months posttreatment. The primary endpoint was the clinical response rate (CR), and the secondary endpoints were the overall survival (OS), the progression-free survival (PFS), and the safety profile of the two treatments. RESULTS: The results showed that DEB-TACE was superior to cTACE in terms of CR (50.0% vs 30.6% at 3 months, p = 0.03; 43.1% vs 25.0% at 12 months, p = 0.04), OS (18.2 months vs 14.6 months, p < 0.05), and PFS (7.4 months vs 4.8 months, p < 0.05), and that the safety profile of the two treatments was similar (p > 0.05 for all comparisons). However, the efficacy of DEB-TACE and cTACE varied according to the tumor morphology. DEB-TACE showed better CR rates in patients with nodular tumors, while no significant difference in CR between the two groups in patients with infiltrative tumors. CONCLUSION: DEB-TACE showed superior efficacy to cTACE in terms of CR, OS, and PFS, particularly in patients with nodular tumors, while maintaining a similar safety profile.

We evaluated the effects of L-carnitine on post-TACE impaired liver functions. Methods. 53 cirrhotic hepatocellular carcinoma patients at Osaka Medical College were enrolled in this study and assigned into either L-carnitine group receiving 600 mg oral L-carnitine daily or control group. Liver functions were evaluated at pre-TACE and 1, 4, and 12 weeks after TACE. Results. The L-carnitine group maintained Child-Pugh (CP) score at 1 week after TACE and exhibited significant improvement at 4 weeks after TACE (P < 0.01).

166,Cabozantinib exposure-response analyses of efficacy and safety in patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma.,10.1007/s10928-019-09659-y,"Cabozantinib, a multi-kinase inhibitor, is approved in the United States and European Union for treatment of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma following prior sorafenib treatment. In the Phase III CELESTIAL trial, hepatocellular carcinoma patients receiving cabozantinib showed longer overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) than those receiving placebo. The approved cabozantinib (Cabometyx(®)) dose is 60 mg once daily with allowable dose modifications to manage adverse events (AE). Time-to-event Cox proportional hazard exposure-response (ER) models were developed to characterize the relationship between predicted cabozantinib exposure and the likelihood of various efficacy and safety endpoints. The ER models were used to predict hazard ratios (HR) for efficacy and safety endpoints for starting doses of 60, 40, or 20 mg daily. Statistically significant relationships between cabozantinib exposure and efficacy and safety endpoints were observed. For efficacy endpoints, predicted HR were lower for OS and PFS at 40 and 60 mg relative to the 20 mg dose: HR for death (OS) are 0.84 (40 mg) and 0.70 (60 mg); HR for disease progression/death (PFS) are 0.73 (40 mg) and 0.62 (60 mg). For safety endpoints, predicted HR were lower for palmar-plantar erythrodysaesthesia (PPE), diarrhea, and hypertension at 20 or 40 mg relative to the 60 mg dose: HR for PPE are 0.31 (20 mg) and 0.66 (40 mg); HR for diarrhea are 0.61 (20 mg) and 0.86 (40 mg); HR for hypertension are 0.46 (20 mg) and 0.76 (40 mg). The rate of dose modifications was predicted to increase in patients with lower cabozantinib apparent clearance. OS and PFS showed the greatest benefit at the 60 mg dose.

167,Efficacy and safety of hepatic arterial infusion chemotherapy combined with donafenib in the treatment of unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma.,10.1111/ajco.14105,"OBJECTIVE: This study aimed at ascertaining the efficacy and safety of hepatic arterial infusion chemotherapy (HAIC) combined with donafenib versus HAIC alone in the treatment of unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). METHODS: Seventy HCC patients were enrolled for our study, and they were randomized by simple randomization using computer-generated random numbers into two groups: control group and observation group. Regular follow-up reviews were conducted to assess the efficacy of treatments. The levels of apoptotic factors, the levels of hepatic fibrosis indices, the levels of serum tumor vascular factors and tumor markers, and the occurrence of adverse reactions in the two groups were recorded and compared. RESULTS: Disease control rate, objective response rate, and progression-free survival (PFS) of patients in the observation group were higher in contrast to the control group. After 12 weeks of treatment, lower mRNA expression of c-mesenchymal-epithelial transition factor, telomerase, and Fas Ligand and higher mRNA expression of Fas and Caspase-3 were observed in HCC tissues of the observation group versus the control group (p < 0.05); lower detection values of serum laminin, hyaluronic acid, collage type IV, vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2, and alpha-fetal protein (AFP) were noted in HCC patients of the observation group in comparison to the control group (p < 0.05); there was no difference in the incidence of adverse reactions between the two groups.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this prospective, randomized trial, 92 patients undergoing DEE-TACE for hepatocellular carcinoma were enrolled. The control group received standard intraprocedural local anesthetic, intra-arterial lidocaine, and intravenous analgesia; the study group underwent additional hepatic hilar and celiac plexus nerve blocks. Intra-arterial lidocaine, intravenous and oral narcotic and antiemetic requirements after the procedure, pain, patient satisfaction, adverse events, and hospital stay were compared. RESULTS: The nerve block group reported less pain during and after the procedure at days 1 and 7 (P < .001), although differences resolved by week 2. The control group received more intra-arterial lidocaine (P < .001) and required approximately double the amount of narcotic analgesia during and after the procedure, extending to 3 weeks after the procedure (P < .001), as well as less antiemetics (P < .001). No differences in adverse events, hospital stay, and overall patient satisfaction were noted.

170,Cost-Utility Analysis of Transarterial Radioembolization With Yttrium-90 Resin Microspheres Compared With Sorafenib in Locally Advanced and Inoperable Hepatocellular Carcinoma.,10.1016/j.clinthera.2021.04.018,"PURPOSE: The SARAH (Sorafenib Versus Radioembolization in Advanced Hepatocellular Carcinoma) trial (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier NCT01482442) did not show a significant survival benefit for patients treated with transarterial radioembolization (TARE) compared with continuous oral sorafenib. The improved toxicity profile of patients treated with TARE in the trial, however, could result in a quality of life benefit in economic evaluations. Our objective was to perform a cost-utility analysis of TARE versus sorafenib for locally advanced and inoperable hepatocellular carcinoma. METHODS: This study used patient-level data of the SARAH trial regarding resource use, progression-free and overall survival, and quality of life for the within-trial period for the patients who received at least 1 dose of sorafenib or 1 treatment with TARE according to their randomization arm. Data were extrapolated by using a partitioned survival model that incorporated costs and health outcomes, measured in life-years and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs). FINDINGS: The use of TARE resulted in an average loss of 0.036 life-year and a gain of 0.006 QALY compared with sorafenib. The aerage cost for the TARE arm was €17,179 (95% CI, 9,926-24,280) higher than the sorafenib arm, for an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of €3,153,086/QALY. The probabilistic sensitivity analysis revealed a 50% risk that the TARE strategy was dominated. TARE was consistently dominated by sorafenib or had an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio more than €450,000/QALY in all sensitivity analyses.

171,Prospective randomized pilot study of Y90+/-sorafenib as bridge to transplantation in hepatocellular carcinoma.,10.1016/j.jhep.2014.03.023,"BACKGROUND & AIMS: To investigate the safety and adverse event profile of sorafenib plus radioembolization (Y90) compared to Y90 alone in patients awaiting liver transplantation. METHODS: 20 patients with HCC were randomized to Y90 alone (Group A) or Y90+sorafenib (Group B). Adverse events, dose reductions, and peri-transplant complications were assessed. RESULTS: All patients in the sorafenib group necessitated dose reductions. Seventeen of 20 patients underwent liver transplantation; median time-to-transplant was 7.8 months (range: 4.2-20.3) and similar between groups (p = 0.35). In the sorafenib group, there were 4/8 peri-transplant (<30 days) biliary complications (p = 0.029) and 3/8 acute rejections (p = 0.082); there were none in the Y90-only group. Survival rates were 70% (Group A) and 72% (Group B) at 3 years (p = 0.57). CONCLUSIONS: The addition of sorafenib to Y90 necessitated dose reductions in all patients awaiting transplantation. Preliminary data suggest that the combination was associated with more peri-transplant biliary complications and potentially trended towards more acute rejections. Caution should be exercised when considering sorafenib in the transplant setting. Further investigation is warranted. Elsevier B.V.

The study aimed to investigate the effects of preoperative interview and prospective nursing in patients with hepatic carcinoma undergoing transcatheter chemoembolization (TACE). Eighty-six patients with hepatocellular carcinoma who underwent TACE intervention treatment at our hospital between 2020 and 2023 were selected and randomly assigned to 2 groups using computerized randomization. The control group (n = 43) received routine nursing care, while the study group (n = 43) received preoperative interviews in combination with prospective nursing during the procedure. The patients' heart rate, mean arterial pressure, and blood pressure variations were recorded, along with their mood changes after intervention. The postoperative pain and satisfaction levels were compared between the 2 groups of patients, and the incidence of postoperative complications was observed. The heart rate, systolic blood pressure, and diastolic blood pressure of the 2 groups of patients were compared 1 day before the operation (P > .05). Compared to 1 day before the operation, there was no significant change for the study group at 10 minutes after entering the room. However, the control group showed an increase. Both groups showed an increase in heart rate, systolic blood pressure, and diastolic blood pressure after the operation, with the study group having lower values than the control group (P < .05). The levels of tension, fatigue, anxiety, energy, anger, depression, self-esteem, and POMS index were compared between the 2 groups before intervention (P > .05). After intervention, there were significant differences between the 2 groups(P < .05). Immediately after the operation, the NRS scores of the 2 groups of patients were compared (P > .05). Compared to the control group, the study group showed a decrease in NRS scores at 12, 24, and 48 hours after the operation (P < .05).

174,Benefit-Risk Summary of Regorafenib for the Treatment of Patients with Advanced Hepatocellular Carcinoma That Has Progressed on Sorafenib.,10.1634/theoncologist.2017-0422,"On April 27, 2017, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved regorafenib for the treatment of patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) who had previously been treated with sorafenib. Approval was based on the results of a single, randomized, placebo-controlled trial (RESORCE) that demonstrated an improvement in overall survival (OS). Patients were randomly allocated to receive regorafenib160 mg orally once daily or matching placebo for the first 21 days of each 28-day cycle. The trial demonstrated a significant improvement in OS (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.63; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.50-0.79, p < .0001) with an estimated median OS of 10.6 months in the regorafenib arm and 7.8 months in the placebo arm. A statistically significant improvement in progression-free survival (PFS) based on modified RECIST for HCC [Semin Liver Dis 2010;30:52-60] (HR = 0.46; 95% CI, 0.37-0.56, p < .0001) was also demonstrated; the estimated median PFS was 3.1 and 1.5 months in the regorafenib and placebo arms, respectively. The overall response rate, based on modified RECIST for HCC, was 11% in the regorafenib arm and 4% in the placebo arm. The toxicity profile was consistent with that observed in other indications; the most clinically significant adverse reactions were palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia, diarrhea, and hypertension. Based on the improvement in survival and acceptable toxicity, a favorable benefit-to-risk evaluation led to approval for treatment of patients with advanced HCC.

No randomized trial has demonstrated superiority of chemoembolization compared with embolization, and the role of chemotherapy remains unclear. This randomized trial compares the outcome of embolization using microspheres alone with chemoembolization using doxorubicin-eluting microspheres. MATERIALS AND METHODS: At a single tertiary referral center, patients with HCC were randomly assigned to embolization with microspheres alone (Bead Block [BB]) or loaded with doxorubicin 150 mg (LC Bead [LCB]). Random assignment was stratified by number of embolizations to complete treatment, and assignments were generated by permuted blocks in the institutional database. The primary end point was response according to RECIST 1.0 (Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors) using multiphase computed tomography 2 to 3 weeks post-treatment and then at quarterly intervals, with the reviewer blinded to treatment allocation. Secondary objectives included safety and tolerability, time to progression, progression-free survival, and overall survival. This trial is currently closed to accrual. RESULTS: Between December 2007 and April 2012, 101 patients were randomly assigned: 51 to BB and 50 to LCB. Demographics were comparable: median age, 67 years; 77% male; and 22% Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer stage A and 78% stage B or C.

Brivanib, a selective dual inhibitor of vascular endothelial growth factor and fibroblast growth factor signaling, may improve the effectiveness of TACE when given as an adjuvant to TACE. In this multinational, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase III study, 870 patients with TACE-eligible HCC were planned to be randomly assigned (1:1) after the first TACE to receive either brivanib 800 mg or placebo orally once-daily. The primary endpoint was overall survival (OS). Secondary endpoints included time to disease progression (TTDP; a composite endpoint based on development of extrahepatic spread or vascular invasion, deterioration of liver function or performance status, or death), time to extrahepatic spread or vascular invasion (TTES/VI), rate of TACE, and safety. Time to radiographic progression (TTP) and objective response rate were exploratory endpoints. The trial was terminated after randomization of 502 patients (brivanib, 249; placebo, 253) when two other phase III studies of brivanib in advanced HCC patients failed to meet OS objectives.

177,A prediction model for liver abscess developing after transarterial chemoembolization in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma.,10.1016/j.dld.2014.05.003,"BACKGROUND: Liver abscess is a rare but potentially fatal complication of transarterial chemoembolization. Other than for biliary abnormalities, risk factors for liver abscess formation after transarterial chemoembolization have rarely been discussed. AIMS: To identify other risk factors of liver abscess after transarterial chemoembolization in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma. METHODS: Data for 5299 patients with hepatocellular carcinoma who underwent transarterial chemoembolization from July 1999 to December 2009 were retrospectively reviewed. 72 patients who experienced liver abscess after transarterial chemoembolization were enrolled as a case group, which was compared with a randomly selected control group (n=1009) of patients who did not develop liver abscess after transarterial chemoembolization. RESULTS: Pneumobilia, type 2 biliary abnormality, type 1 biliary abnormality, diabetes mellitus, tumour number (≥3), tumour size (≥3cm), and tumour necrosis on the pre-transarterial chemoembolization computed tomography, and gelfoam embolization and vessel injury during transarterial chemoembolization were all significant predisposing factors for liver abscess after transarterial chemoembolization. A prediction model for postembolization liver abscess was developed from these risk factors.

Despite recent advances, more effective therapeutic options for patients with advanced HCC are still required. The aim of this Phase 2, multicenter, multinational, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study (NCT02528643) was to investigate the potential benefit of enzalutamide in the treatment of patients with advanced HCC. METHODS: Patients aged ≥ 18 years diagnosed with advanced HCC (Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer stage B or C and Child-Pugh class A at screening who had progressed on, or were intolerant to, sorafenib or other anti-vascular endothelial growth factor therapies) were randomized 2:1 to receive either enzalutamide 160 mg daily or placebo. The primary endpoint was overall survival (OS); secondary endpoints included progression-free survival (PFS) and safety. RESULTS: In total, 165 patients were randomized to enzalutamide (n = 110) or placebo (n = 55). The hazard ratio (HR) (95% confidence interval [CI]) for OS was 1.15 (0.774-1.696) and median OS was 7.8 months and 7.7 months for enzalutamide and placebo, respectively. The HR (95% CI) for PFS was 1.04 (0.732-1.474) and median PFS was 2.2 months and 1.9 months for enzalutamide and placebo, respectively.

180,"Safety, pharmacokinetics and efficacy of donafenib in treating advanced hepatocellular carcinoma: report from a phase 1b trial.",10.1691/ph.2019.9626,"Background: Donafenib is a novel compound similar to sorafenib that functions as a multikinase inhibitor. This phase 1b trial aimed to assess the safety, pharmacokinetics and efficacy of donafenib in treating Chinese patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma. Methods: From July 2014 to April 2015, 27 eligible advanced hepatocellular carcinoma patients were enrolled in the trial. They were randomly divided into 200 mg and 300 mg bid groups and received these oral doses of donafenib until the appearance of intolerance or disease progression. Results: Overall, donafenib was safe and well tolerated in the two groups, and most adverse events were grade 1 or 2. Elevated transaminase (n=19, 70.4 %), hypocalcemia (n=19, 70.4 %), and skin toxicity (n=17, 63.0 %) were the most frequently encountered adverse events. Donafenib exhibited high variability in pharmacokinetic parameters. Areas under the plasma concentration-time curve from 0-12 h increased disproportionally to the dose escalation. The treatment resulted in partial response in two patients and a stable disease status in 17 patients, and the median time to progression was 120 days for both groups.

181,Transcutaneous Electrical Acustimulation Improves Gastrointestinal Disturbances Induced by Transcatheter Arterial Chemoembolization in Patients With Liver Cancers.,10.1111/ner.13158,"BACKGROUND: Gastrointestinal (GI) disturbances occur in patients who receive chemotherapy via transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (TACE) and could last for an extended period of time in some cases. Antiemetic drugs have a potential risk of developing hepatic failure and are ineffective for delayed nausea and emesis. Transcutaneous electrical acustimulation (TEA) has recently been reported to exert antiemetic and prokinetic effects, but it is unknown whether it has an ameliorating effect on TACE-induced GI disturbances. AIM: This study was designed to evaluate effects and mechanisms of noninvasive TEA on GI symptoms in patients treated with TACE. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Seventy-four patients with liver cancers (eighteen female; age 63.4 ± 1.1 years) scheduled for TACE were randomized to TEA (n = 37) or sham-TEA (n = 37). TEA was performed via acupoints, ST36 and PC6 using parameters previously optimized for GI motility (1 h, bid) from the postoperative day 0 (POD0) to POD2. Sham-TEA was performed using the same parameters via non-acupoints. Symptom questionnaires were completed daily. The electrogastrogram (EGG) and electrocardiogram (ECG) were recorded in the fasting state for 30 mins to assess gastric slow waves and autonomic functions, respectively, before and after the 3-day treatment. RESULTS: 1) In the acute phase (<24 h), TEA showed no effects on any of GI symptoms, compared with sham-TEA. 2) In the delayed phase (>24 h), TEA, compared with sham-TEA, decreased the percentage of patients who experienced nausea on POD3 (0% vs. 13.5%, p = 0.021), the nausea score on POD3 (p = 0.022), the anorexia score on POD2 (p = 0.040) and POD3 (p = 0.004), and the bloating score (POD1-3: p < 0.01). 3) In comparison with sham-TEA, TEA increased the number of spontaneous bowel movements (p = 0.001) and the Bristol score of the first stool (p = 0.014) and decreased the number of patients with the use of laxatives (p = 0.022). 4) Physiologically, the 3-day TEA but not sham-TEA increased the percentage of normal gastric slow waves (p < 0.001) and vagal activity (p = 0.006). The vagal activity was negatively correlated with the anorexia score (r = -0.267, p = 0.026). It was found that the sympathovagal ratio and tumor size>5 cm were independent risk factors predicting the occurrence of nausea in patients after TACE.

This prespecified subgroup analysis evaluated the efficacy and safety of ramucirumab in the Japanese patients enrolled in the study. METHODS: Patients with advanced HCC and AFP ≥ 400 ng/mL after first-line sorafenib were randomized 2:1 to ramucirumab (8 mg/kg intravenously) or placebo every 2 weeks. Hazard ratios for progression-free survival (PFS) and OS (primary endpoint of the overall study) were estimated using the stratified Cox regression model. We also pooled individual patient data from REACH-2 with data from REACH (NCT01140347) for patients with AFP ≥ 400 ng/mL. RESULTS: In the Japanese REACH-2 subpopulation, there were improvements for ramucirumab (n = 41) versus placebo (n = 18) in PFS (HR 0.282, 95% CI 0.144-0.553) and OS was numerically prolonged (HR 0.599, 95% CI 0.303-1.187), consistent with the significant benefit seen in the overall REACH-2 study population.

It identified tumor MET as a key biomarker in HCC.Aim of this research was to study the prognostic and predictive value of tumor (MET, the receptor tyrosine kinase encoded by the homonymous MNNG-HOS transforming gene) and circulating (MET, hepatocyte growth factor [HGF], alpha-fetoprotein [AFP], vascular endothelial growth factor [VEGF]) biomarkers in second-line HCC. Tumor MET-High status was centrally assessed by immunohistochemistry. Circulating biomarkers were centrally analyzed on serum samples collected at baseline and every 4-8 weeks, using medians as cut-off to determine High/Low status. Tumor MET, tested in 77 patients, was more frequently High after (82%) versus before (40%) sorafenib. A significant interaction (p = 0.04) between tivantinib and baseline tumor MET in terms of survival was observed. Baseline circulating MET and HGF (102 patients) High status correlated with shorter survival (HR 0.61, p = 0.03, and HR 0.60, p = 0.02, respectively), while the association between AFP (104 patients) or VEGF (103 patients) status and survival was non-significant.

Studies have shown that transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (TACE) combined with high intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) has significant efficacy, but there are relatively few studies on TACE combined with HIFU in China. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effect of using HIFU combined with TACE on patients' liver function impairment and immune function in pediatric HB patients and to analyze the effectiveness and safety. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The clinical data of 110 unresectable pediatric HB patients treated in our hospital from December 2019 to December 2021 were selected as the subjects and divided into 2 groups. The comparison group was treated with TACE, and the combination group was treated with HIFU on the basis of the comparison group. The differences in immune function, survival, treatment side effects and clinical efficacy between the 2 groups were observed. RESULTS: In the combined group, the 1-year survival rate was 100%, the 3-year survival rate was 84.0%, the 5-year survival rate was 16.0%; while in comparison group, it was 82%, 16%, 0%, respectively.

The primary objective of this study was to evaluate the in vivo delivery performance of DOX from LIPDOX or DEBDOX in HCC patients using the local and systemic pharmacokinetics of DOX and its main metabolite doxorubicinol (DOXol). Urinary excretion of DOX and DOXol and their short-term safety and antitumor effects were also evaluated. In this open, prospective, nonrandomized multicenter study, LIPDOX (n = 13) or DEBDOX (n = 12) were injected into the feeding arteries of the tumor. Local (vena cava/hepatic vein orifice) and systemic (peripheral vein) plasma concentrations of DOX and DOXol were determined in samples obtained up to 6 h and 7 days after treatment.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Eligible patients had Child-Pugh A liver function and ≤1 prior systemic anticancer regimen, completed ≥4 weeks before study entry. The cabozantinib starting dose was 100 mg daily. After an initial 12-week cabozantinib treatment period, patients with stable disease (SD) per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) version 1.0 were randomized to cabozantinib or placebo. The primary endpoint of the lead-in stage was objective response rate (ORR) at week 12, and the primary endpoint of the randomized stage was progression-free survival (PFS). RESULTS: Among the 41 HCC patients enrolled, the week 12 ORR was 5%, with 2 patients achieving a confirmed partial response (PR). The week 12 disease control rate (PR or SD) was 66% (Asian subgroup: 73%). Of patients with ≥1 post-baseline scan, 78% had tumor regression, with no apparent relationship to prior sorafenib therapy.

A hand-foot skin reaction (HFSR) prevention substudy assessed HFSR incidence and grade/severity and time to HFSR in 29 and 34 patients randomized to corticosteroid and noncorticosteroid ointments, respectively, and in 88 nonrandomized patients. RESULTS: The 151 patients included 120 (80%) male patients and 81 (54%) with stage IV disease. Mean sorafenib dose was 626 mg/day, and median treatment duration was 4.2 months. Median overall survival (OS), progression-free survival, and time to progression (TTP) were 8.6, 2.7, and 3.8 months, respectively.

METHODS: From March 2015 to August 2015, a total of 44 patients with moderate and advanced HCC, who were admitted in the Navy General Hospital of China, were included into this study. These patients were randomly divided into 2 groups: group A and group B. Patients in group A underwent TACE alone, while patients in group B underwent the combined treatment of TACE with apatinib. Differences in preoperative general data between these 2 groups were not statistically significant (P > 0.05). All patients were followed up for 12-18 months. Changes in α-fetal protein (AFP) at 3 months after treatment and the objective response rate (ORR) at 3, 6, 9 and 12 months after treatment were compared between these 2 groups.

191,Are we SHARP enough? The importance of adequate patient selection in sorafenib treatment for hepatocellular carcinoma.,10.1080/0284186X.2018.1479070,"BACKGROUND: Upon FDA/EMEA registration for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), sorafenib received a broader therapeutic indication than the eligibility criteria of the landmark SHARP trial. This allowed treatment of SHARP non-eligible patients in daily clinical practice. AIM: To assess sorafenib efficacy and safety in SHARP eligible and non-eligible patients, and determine the validity of the current therapeutic indication as described by the FDA/EMEA. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Consecutive patients treated with sorafenib for advanced HCC at two Dutch tertiary referral centers between 2007 and 2016 were analyzed retrospectively. Primary outcome was overall survival (OS). Secondary outcomes were time to progression (TTP), response rate, adverse events and reasons for discontinuation. Outcomes were compared between SHARP eligible and non-eligible patients. RESULTS: One hundred and ninety-three of 257 (75%) patients were SHARP eligible. SHARP eligible patients (9.5 months, 95% CI 7.7-11.3) had a longer median OS than non-eligible patients (5.4 months, 95% CI 3.6-7.1) (log-rank p < .001). SHARP non-eligible patients were more often Child-Pugh B, had higher AST and ALT levels and developed more grade 3-4 liver dysfunction (44 versus 23%, p < .001) during treatment. SHARP ineligibility remained the strongest predictor of OS (HR 1.78, 95% CI 1.32-2.41) and an independent predictor of TTP (HR 1.45, 95% CI 1.05-2.00) in multivariable analysis.

192,Surgical Resection is Better than Transarterial Chemoembolization for Patients with Hepatocellular Carcinoma Beyond the Milan Criteria: A Prognostic Nomogram Study.,10.1245/s10434-015-4929-x,"BACKGROUND: The clinical outcomes in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients receiving surgical resection (SR) or transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) are diverse. This study aimed to develop a nomogram to predict individualized survival risk in patients with HCC beyond the Milan criteria undergoing aggressive treatments (SR and TACE). METHODS: A total of 1009 patients were enrolled in the study and randomly grouped into derivation (n = 505) and validation sets (n = 504). The multivariate Cox proportional hazards model was used to select significant prognostic predictors from the derivation set to generate the nomogram. The performance of the nomogram was evaluated by discrimination (concordance index) and calibration tests. RESULTS: Serum albumin <3.8 g/dL, α-fetoprotein ≥400 ng/mL, TACE, vascular invasion, multiple tumors, and tumor volume ≥200 cm(3) were associated with poor survival in the multivariate Cox model (all p < 0.05). A nomogram with a scale of 0-47 was developed with these six variables, and the predicted survival rates at 1 and 3 years were calculated. The derivation set with bootstrapping (B = 100) had a good concordance index of 0.694 [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.68-0.708]. Discrimination test in the validation set provided a concordance index of 0.71 (95 % CI 0.697-0.722), and the calibration plots well-matched the 45-degree line for 1- and 3-year survival prediction. The respective survival for patients undergoing SR or TACE could be predicted based on the nomogram across different risk scores.

193,Ramucirumab in the second-line for patients with hepatocellular carcinoma and elevated alpha-fetoprotein: patient-reported outcomes across two randomised clinical trials.,10.1136/esmoopen-2020-000797,"BACKGROUND: Symptoms of advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) represent a substantial burden for the patient and are important endpoints to assess when evaluating treatment. Patient-reported outcomes were evaluated in subjects with advanced HCC and baseline alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) ≥400 ng/mL treated with second-line ramucirumab. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients with AFP≥400 ng/mL enrolled in the REACH or REACH-2 phase 3 studies were used in this analysis. Eligible patients had advanced HCC, Child-Pugh A, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status 0/1 and prior sorafenib. Patients received ramucirumab 8 mg/kg or placebo once every 2 weeks. Disease-related symptoms and health-related quality of life (HRQoL) were assessed with the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy Hepatobiliary Symptom Index (FHSI)-8 and EuroQoL-5-Dimensions (EQ-5D) instruments, respectively. Time to deterioration (TTD) (≥3-point decrease in FHSI-8 total score;≥0.06-point decrease in EQ-5D score, from randomisation to first date of deterioration) was determined using Kaplan-Meier estimation and the Cox proportional hazards model. Both separate and pooled analyses for REACH AFP≥400 ng/mL and REACH-2 patients were conducted. RESULTS: In the pooled population with AFP ≥400 ng/mL (n=542; ramucirumab, n=316; placebo, n=226), median TTD in FHSI-8 total score was prolonged with ramucirumab relative to placebo (3.3 vs 1.9 months; HR 0.725; (95% CI 0.559 to 0.941); p=0.0152), including significant differences in back pain (0.668; (0.497 to 0.899); p=0.0044), weight loss (0.699; (0.505 to 0.969); p=0.0231) and pain (0.769; (0.588 to 1.005); p=0.0248) symptoms. TTD in EQ-5D score was not significantly different between ramucirumab and placebo groups (median 2.9 vs 1.9 months). Results in the individual trials were consistent with these findings. CONCLUSIONS: Ramucirumab in second-line treatment of advanced HCC demonstrates consistent benefit in the delay of deterioration in disease-related symptoms with no worsening of HRQoL. Taken with previously demonstrated ramucirumab-driven survival benefits in this setting, these data may inform patient-clinician discussions about the benefit-risk profile of this therapy.

194,The value of sorafenib trough levels in patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma - a substudy of the SORAMIC trial.,10.1080/0284186X.2020.1759826,"Background: Sorafenib for advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is dose adjusted by toxicity. Preliminary studies have suggested an association between plasma concentrations of sorafenib and its main metabolite (M2) and clinical outcomes. This study aimed to validate these findings and establish target values for sorafenib trough concentrations.Methods: Patients with advanced HCC were prospectively recruited within a multicenter phase II study (SORAMIC). Patients with blood samples available at trough level were included for this pharmacokinetic (PK) substudy. Trough plasma concentrations of sorafenib and its main metabolite (M2) were associated with sorafenib-related toxicity and overall survival (OS).Results: Seventy-four patients were included with a median OS of 19.7 months (95% CI 16.1-23.3). Patients received sorafenib for a median of 51 weeks (IQR 27-62) and blood samples were drawn after a median of 25 weeks (IQR 10-42). Patients had a median trough concentration of 3217 ng/ml (IQR 2166-4526) and 360 ng/ml (IQR 190-593) with coefficients of variation of 65% and 146% for sorafenib and M2, respectively. Patients who experienced severe sorafenib-related toxicity received a lower average daily dose (551 vs 730 mg/day, p = .003), but showed no significant differences in sorafenib (3298 vs 2915 ng/ml, p = .442) or M2 trough levels (428 vs 283 ng/ml, p = .159). Trough levels of sorafenib or M2 showed no significant association with OS.Conclusions: In patients with advanced HCC treated with sorafenib, the administered dose, trough levels of sorafenib or M2, and clinical outcomes were poorly correlated.

195,Biomarker Analyses of Clinical Outcomes in Patients with Advanced Hepatocellular Carcinoma Treated with Sorafenib with or without Erlotinib in the SEARCH Trial.,,"PURPOSE: Sorafenib is the current standard therapy for advanced hepatocellular carcinoma, but validated biomarkers predicting clinical outcomes are lacking. This study aimed to identify biomarkers predicting prognosis and/or response to sorafenib, with or without erlotinib, in hepatocellular carcinoma patients from the phase III SEARCH trial. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: A total of 720 patients were randomized to receive oral sorafenib 400 mg twice daily plus erlotinib 150 mg once daily or placebo. Fifteen growth factors relevant to the treatment regimen and/or to hepatocellular carcinoma were measured in baseline plasma samples. RESULTS: Baseline plasma biomarkers were measured in 494 (69%) patients (sorafenib plus erlotinib, n = 243; sorafenib plus placebo, n = 251). Treatment arm-independent analyses showed that elevated hepatocyte growth factor [HGF; HR, 1.687 (high vs. low expression); endpoint multiplicity adjusted (e-adj) P = 0.0001] and elevated plasma VEGFA (HR, 1.386; e-adj P = 0.0377) were significantly associated with poor overall survival (OS) in multivariate analyses, and low plasma KIT [HR, 0.75 (high vs. low); P = 0.0233; e-adj P = 0.2793] tended to correlate with poorer OS. High plasma VEGFC independently correlated with longer TTP (HR, 0.633; e-adj P = 0.0010) and trended toward associating with improved disease control rate (univariate: OR, 2.047; P = 0.030; e-adj P = 0.420). In 67% of evaluable patients (339/494), a multimarker signature of HGF, VEGFA, KIT, EPGN, and VEGFC correlated with improved median OS in multivariate analysis (HR, 0.150; P < 0.00001). No biomarker predicted efficacy from erlotinib. CONCLUSIONS: Baseline plasma HGF, VEGFA, KIT, and VEGFC correlated with clinical outcomes in hepatocellular carcinoma patients treated with sorafenib with or without erlotinib. These biomarkers plus EPGN constituted a multimarker signature for improved OS.

196,"Randomized, open-label phase 2 study comparing frontline dovitinib versus sorafenib in patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma.",10.1002/hep.28600,"Angiogenesis inhibition by the vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR) and platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR) inhibitor sorafenib provides survival benefit in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC); however, angiogenic escape from sorafenib may occur due to angiogenesis-associated fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR) pathway activation. In addition to VEGFR and PDGFR, dovitinib inhibits FGFR. Frontline oral dovitinib (500 mg/day, 5 days on, 2 days off; n = 82) versus sorafenib (400 mg twice daily; n = 83) was evaluated in an open-label, randomized phase 2 study of Asian-Pacific patients with advanced HCC. The primary and key secondary endpoints were overall survival (OS) and time to tumor progression (TTP) as determined by a local investigator, respectively. Patients included in the study were ineligible for surgical and/or locoregional therapies or had disease progression after receiving these therapies. The median OS (95% confidence interval [CI]) was 8.0 (6.6-9.1) months for dovitinib and 8.4 (5.4-11.3) months for sorafenib. The median TTP (95% CI) per investigator assessment was 4.1 (2.8-4.2) months and 4.1 (2.8-4.3) months for dovitinib and sorafenib, respectively. Common any-cause adverse events included diarrhea (62%), decreased appetite (43%), nausea (41%), vomiting (41%), fatigue (35%), rash (34%), and pyrexia (30%) for dovitinib and palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia syndrome (66%) and decreased appetite (31%) for sorafenib. Subgroup analysis revealed a significantly higher median OS for patients in the dovitinib arm who had baseline plasma soluble VEGFR1 (sVEGFR1) and hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) below median levels versus at or above the median levels (median OS [95% CI]: sVEGFR1, 11.2 [9.0-13.8] and 5.7 [4.3-7.0] months, respectively [P = .0002]; HGF, 11.2 [8.9-13.8] and 5.9 [5.0-7.6] months, respectively [P = 0.0002]). CONCLUSION: Dovitinib was well tolerated, but activity was not greater than sorafenib as a frontline systemic therapy for HCC. Based on these data, no subsequent phase 3 study has been planned.

197,"Impact of neo-adjuvant Sorafenib treatment on liver transplantation in HCC patients - a prospective, randomized, double-blind, phase III trial.",10.1186/s12885-015-1373-z,"BACKGROUND: Liver Transplantation (LT) is treatment of choice for patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) within MILAN Criteria. Tumour progression and subsequent dropout from waiting list have significant impact on the survival. Transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) controls tumour growth in the treated HCC nodule, however, the risk of tumour development in the untreated liver is increased by simultaneous release of neo-angiogenic factors. Due to its anti-angiogenic effects, Sorafenib delays the progression of HCC. Aim of this study was to determine whether combination of TACE and Sorafenib improves tumour control in HCC patients on waiting list for LT. METHODS: Fifty patients were randomly assigned on a 1:1 ratio in double-blinded fashion at four centers in Germany and treated with TACE plus either Sorafenib (n = 24) or placebo (n = 26). The end of treatment was development of progressive disease according to mRECIST criteria or LT. The primary endpoint of the trial was the Time-to-Progression (TTP). Other efficacy endpoints were Tumour Response, Progression-free Survival (PFS), and Time-to-LT (TTLT). RESULTS: The median time of treatment was 125 days with Sorafenib and 171 days with the placebo. Fourteen patients (seven from each group) developed tumour progression during the course of the study period. The Hazard Ratio of TTP was 1.106 (95% CI: 0.387, 3.162). The results of the Objective Response Rate, Disease Control Rate, PFS, and TTLT were comparable in both groups. The incidence of AEs was comparable in the placebo group (n = 23, 92%) and in the Sorafenib group (n = 23, 96%). Twelve patients (50%) on Sorafenib and four patients (16%) on placebo experienced severe treatment-related AEs. CONCLUSION: The TTP is similar after neo-adjuvant treatment with TACE and Sorafenib before LT compared to TACE and placebo. The Tumour Response, PFS, and TTLT were comparable. The safety profile of the Sorafenib group was similar to that of the placebo group.

METHODS: Nineteen patients, five and fourteen Barcelona-Clinic Liver Cancer staging classification A and B cases, respectively, were randomly assigned to receive either miriplatin monotherapy (n = 9) or miriplatin/DDP-H combination therapy (n = 10). DDP-H and/or miriplatin were administered through the hepatic arteries supplying the lobes of the liver containing tumors, and progression free survival was analyzed as a primary end point in addition to other secondary endpoints. The corresponding therapy was repeated unless disease progression or severe adverse events were recorded. RESULTS: The monotherapy or combination therapy was performed for 15 or 36 sessions in total, respectively. Although there were no significant differences between the two groups for treatment intervals (p = 0.96) or the dose of miriplatin used in each session (p = 0.99), the progression free survival and overall disease control rate were significantly better in the combination therapy group (91 vs 423 days, p = 0.025; 40.0 vs 77.8%, p = 0.0025, respectively). Consistent with these observations, a trend of a significantly slower increase in des-γ-carboxyprothrombin was observed, and the number of treatment sessions was nearly significantly larger in the combination therapy group (p < 0.0001, p = 0.057, respectively). Conversely, the median survival time did not show a significant difference (706 days, monotherapy vs 733 days, combination therapy; p = 0.40). A significant decrease in cholinesterase was observed during the course of treatment only in patients receiving combination therapy (r = -0.86, p < 0.0001). A few cases in both arms showed hematological and/or non-hematological toxicities that were categorized as grade 1 (NCI-CTCAE). CONCLUSIONS: The higher disease control effects with the combination of miriplatin and DDP-H indicate that it is a promising alternative treatment for cases with multiple HCCs, especially for those that can tolerate the treatment without experiencing a reduction in hepatic reserve.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: 62 patients with primary hepatocellular carcinoma admitted in our hospital from June 2015 to June 2016 were enrolled in this study and divided into observation group (n = 31) and control group (n = 31) according to the random number table. The patients in the control group were treated with radiofrequency ablation, and the patients in the observation group were treated with transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (TACE). The patients in both groups received liver protection therapy, hydration, antiemetic and stomach protection. The curative effects, the serum HTATIP2/TIP30, B7-H4, alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and total bilirubin in serum (TBIL), life quality before and after treatment, and survival during the 1-year follow-up, were compared. RESULTS: The total short-term effective rate (70.97%) was higher than the control group (38.71%) (p < 0.05). The serum levels of HTATIP2/TIP30 and B7-H4 were decreased after treatment in both groups (observation group: t = 17.1838, 18.9795, control group: t = 8.3787, 10.6393, p < 0.05).

201,Randomized phase II placebo controlled study of codrituzumab in previously treated patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma.,10.1016/j.jhep.2016.04.004,"BACKGROUND & AIMS: Codrituzumab, a humanized monoclonal antibody against Glypican-3 (GPC3) that is expressed in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), interacts with CD16/FcγRIIIa and triggers antibody-dependent cytotoxicity. Codrituzumab was studied vs. placebo in a randomized phase II trial in advanced HCC patients who had failed prior systemic therapy. METHODS: Patients with advanced HCC who had failed prior systemic therapy, ⩾18years, Eastern cooperative oncology group (ECOG) 0-1, Child-Pugh A were randomized 2:1 to biweekly codrituzumab 1600mg vs. placebo. Patients were stratified based on GPC3 immunohistochemical expression: 2+/3+, 1+, and 0. Primary endpoint was progression free survival. Secondary endpoints include overall survival (OS), tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and an exploratory endpoint in biomarkers analysis. RESULTS: 185 patients were enrolled: 125 received codrituzumab and 60 placebo: Median age 64/63, 85/75% male, 46/42% Asian, ECOG 0 65/63%, 74/77% having vascular invasion and/or extra-hepatic metastasis. 84%/70% had prior sorafenib. Drug exposure was 98.4% of planned dose, with an identical adverse events profile between the 2 groups. The median progression free survival and overall survival in the codrituzumab vs. placebo groups in months were: 2.6 vs. 1.5 (hazard ratios 0.97, p=0.87), and 8.7 vs. 10 (hazard ratios 0.96, p=0.82). Projected Ctrough at cycle 3day 1 based exposure, high CD16/FcγRIIIa on peripheral immune cells, and GPC3 expression in the tumor, were all associated with prolonged progression free survival and overall survival. CONCLUSIONS: Codrituzumab did not show clinical benefit in this previously treated HCC population. Whether higher codrituzumab drug exposure or the use of CD16 and GPC3 as potential biomarkers would improve outcome remain unanswered questions. LAY SUMMARY: Codrituzumab is a manufactured antibody against a liver cancer protein called glypican-3. In this clinical trial, codrituzumab was not found be effective against liver cancer. It was suggested though that a higher dose of codrituzumab or selecting patients with high level of glypican-3 or its mediator CD16 might improve outcome.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Sixty consecutive patients who were diagnosed with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) with pulmonary metastasis were randomized 1:1 into the treatment and control groups. Treatment group underwent transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (TACE) for the primary liver tumor and then underwent As(2) O(3) treatment, whereas control group underwent TACE alone. The treatment group underwent a continuous 5-h intravenous infusion of 10 mg/day As(2) O(3) . The course of As(2) O(3) treatment was initiated 3-5 days after TACE (to allow liver and gastrointestinal function to recover) and continued for 14 consecutive days. All patients in the treatment group underwent at least four treatment courses. Response to treatment was evaluated after four treatment courses. RESULT: In treatment group, two patients had a complete response (CR), six had a partial response (PR), 10 had stable disease (SD), and 12 had progressive disease. A clinically effective rate (CR + PR) was achieved in 26.7%, and the clinical benefit rate (CR + PR + SD) was 60%. In the control group, no patients had a CR or PR, five had SD, and 25 had progressive disease. The clinically effective rate was 0%, and the clinical benefit rate was 16.7%. The overall 1-year survival was 56.7% in treatment group and 36.7% in control group. The overall 2-year survival was 16.7% in treatment group and 3.3% in control group.

203,Doxorubicin-loaded nanoparticles for patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma after sorafenib treatment failure (RELIVE): a phase 3 randomised controlled trial.,10.1016/S2468-1253(19)30040-8,"BACKGROUND: Cytotoxic chemotherapy is generally ineffective in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma. We assessed the intravenous perfusion of doxorubicin-loaded nanoparticles in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma in whom previous sorafenib therapy had failed. METHODS: We did a multicentre, open-label, randomised, controlled phase 3 trial at 70 sites in 11 countries. Patients with hepatocellular carcinoma with one or more previous systemic therapies, including sorafenib, were randomly assigned to receive 30 mg/m(2) doxorubicin-loaded nanoparticles (30 mg/m(2) group), 20 mg/m(2) doxorubicin-loaded nanoparticles (20 mg/m(2) group), or standard care using a computer-generated randomisation list prepared by the funder and stratified by geographic region. Patients in the experimental groups received perfusion of the drug every 4 weeks and those in the control group received any systemic anticancer therapy (except sorafenib) as per investigator decision. The primary endpoint was overall survival in the intention-to-treat population. Safety was assessed in the population of patients who received at least one dose of their assigned treatment. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01655693. FINDINGS: Between June 15, 2012, and Jan 27, 2017, 541 patients were screened, of whom 144 were excluded and 397 were randomly assigned to one of the groups (133 to the 30 mg/m(2) group; 130 to the 20 mg/m(2) group; and 134 to the control group). Median follow-up was 22·7 months (IQR 11·2-34·9). After pooling the doxorubicin groups for the efficacy analysis, median overall survival was 9·1 months (95% CI 8·1-10·4) in the pooled doxorubicin-loaded nanoparticles group and 9·0 months (7·1-11·8) in the control group (HR 1·00 [95% CI 0·78-1·28], two-sided p=0·99). 227 (94%) of 242 patients who received doxorubicin-loaded nanoparticles and 100 (75%) of 134 patients in the control group had at least one treatment-emergent adverse event. The most common drug-related grade 3 or 4 treatment-emergent adverse events were neutropenia (25 [10%] of 242 treated with doxorubicin-loaded nanoparticles and eight [6%] of 134 in the control group), asthenia (six [2%] and four [3%]), and thrombocytopenia (three [1%] and ten [7%]). Six (2%) patients treated with doxorubicin-loaded nanoparticles and one (1%) of those in the control group were deemed by investigators to have had a drug-related death. Serious adverse events occurred in 74 (31%) patients who received doxorubicin-loaded nanoparticles and 48 (36%) in the control group.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Forty-two patients with HCC (39 men, 57 ± 9 years, 13 first-time TACE) underwent TACE using three-dimensional image guidance with automatic detection of tumor-feeding vessels computed from DP-CBCT (early and delayed arterial phases). Forty-nine other patients with HCC (44 men, 55 ± 12 years, 14 first-time TACE) were treated conventionally using digital subtraction angiography (DSA). Tumor detectability in DP-CBCT was compared to DSA and preoperative CT or magnetic resonance (MR) imaging. Tumor-feeding vessel visibility was rated (good, fair, and poor) intraoperatively by the operators. The superselective embolization success rate, the number of DSA acquisitions, fluoroscopy time, and patient radiation dose were collected and compared using paired t test and the Mann-Whitney U test. RESULTS: Tumor detection of DP-CBCT was superior to DSA (100% vs 83%, P = .001) and comparable to CT-MR (96%, P = .456). Tumor and feeder visibilities were significantly enhanced by DP-CBCT (P < .001). Compared to using DSA, more superselective embolization was achieved (60% vs 49%) with less DSA acquisitions (n = 2.6 ± 0.8 vs n = 3.4 ± 0.7, P < .001) and shorter fluoroscopy time (4.1 ± 2.6 vs 7.1 ± 4.2 minutes, P < .001) with a slight increase in patient radiation exposure, that is, air kerma (median: 0.33, first to third quartiles: 0.24-0.48 vs 0.30, 0.24-0.44 Gy; P = .519) and dose-area product (134, 92-181 vs 97, 75-140 Gy⋅cm(2), P = .048).

In the present study, we aimed to investigate the role of urea cream in the prevention of HFSR or amelioration of HFSR severity. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients with HCC were treated with either placebo cream or urea cream for 12 weeks concomitantly with sorafenib treatment. HFSR development, the Hand-Foot Skin Reaction and Quality of Life (HF-QoL) questionnaire score, and adverse events were assessed at 2, 4, 8 and 12 weeks. RESULTS: Of the 288 patients, 247 patients, with 117 patients in the placebo control group and 130 patients in the urea cream group, were analysed. The urea cream group showed a trend towards a lower cumulative incidence of any-grade HFSR (log-rank, P = 0.247) and severe HFSR of grade II or higher (log-rank, P = 0.394) without statistical significance. In the incidence by time point, the incidence of severe HFSR of grade II or higher was significantly lower in the urea cream group than in the placebo control group at 2 weeks (13.8% versus 23.9%, P = 0.042). The urea cream group showed a significantly better HF-QoL questionnaire score than the placebo control group (11.8 versus 19.7, P = 0.014) at 12 weeks. CONCLUSIONS: Treatment with urea cream showed a lower incidence of severe sorafenib-induced HFSR at 2 weeks and reduced the tendency of HFSR development in HCC patients.

METHODS: A single-blind, three-group parallel, randomized trial was conducted in Guangdong General Hospital, Guangzhou, China, with patients with biopsy-confirmed HCC. Group 1 received single-drug (doxorubicin) chemoembolization, while group 2 received double-drug (doxorubicin and mitomycin C) chemoembolization. Patients in group 3 were treated with triple-drug (doxorubicin, mitomycin C, and gemcitabine) chemoembolization. Lipiodol was used as embolization agent in all protocols. We compared the overall survival (OS), time to progression (TTP), and objective response rate (ORR) between groups. Response assessment was performed according to modified RECIST (Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors) criteria. RESULTS: Between January 2008 and January 2011, 162 patients (group 1, n = 50; group 2, n = 59; group 3, n = 53) were recruited.

We compared the survival of patients treated with TACE and sorafenib with that of patients treated with TACE alone. METHODS: This was a post hoc analysis of the Study in Asia of the Combination of TACE with Sorafenib in Patients with HCC (START) trial. All patients who received TACE and interrupted dosing of sorafenib for early or intermediate-stage HCC in Taiwan from 2009 to 2010 were recruited into the TACE and sorafenib group. They were randomly matched 1:1 by age, sex, Child-Pugh score, tumor size, tumor number, and tumor stage with patients from Taichung Veterans General Hospital in Taiwan who received TACE alone and who fulfilled the selection criteria of the START trial during the same time period (control group). Patient survival [cumulative incidence and hazard ratio (HR)] of the 2 groups were analyzed and compared. RESULTS: The baseline characteristics of the 36 patients in each group were similar. Tumor response rates were significantly better in the TACE and sorafenib group (P < .04). Overall survival of the TACE and sorafenib group was also significantly better than that of the control (TACE alone) group over the 2 years [78%, 95% confidence interval (95% CI) 64-91 vs 49, 95% CI 32-66; P = .012].

This trial evaluated the efficacy and safety of adjuvant transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (TACE) after hepatectomy versus hepatectomy alone in HCC patients with a solitary tumor ≥ 5 cm and MVI. METHODS: In this randomized, open-labeled, phase III trial, HCC patients with a solitary tumor ≥ 5 cm and MVI were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive either 1-2 cycles of adjuvant TACE after hepatectomy (Hepatectomy-TACE) or hepatectomy alone (Hepatectomy Alone). The primary endpoint was disease-free survival (DFS); the secondary endpoints included overall survival (OS) and adverse events. RESULTS: Between June 1, 2009, and December 31, 2012, 250 patients were enrolled and randomly assigned to the Hepatectomy-TACE group (n = 125) or the Hepatectomy Alone group (n = 125). Clinicopathological characteristics were balanced between the two groups. The median follow-up time from randomization was 37.5 months [interquartile range 18.3-48.2 months]. The median DFS was significantly longer in the Hepatectomy-TACE group than in the Hepatectomy Alone group [17.45 months (95% confidence interval [CI] 11.99-29.14) vs. 9.27 months (95% CI 6.05-13.70), hazard ratio [HR] = 0.70 (95% CI 0.52-0.95), P = 0.020], respectively.

Child-Pugh class A/B patients with HCC and no macrovascular invasion/extrahepatic metastases were randomly assigned to either a dexamethasone regimen (day 1, intravenous dexamethasone [20 mg] and granisetron [3 mg] before TACE; days 2 and 3, intravenous dexamethasone [8 mg]) or a control regimen (day 1, intravenous placebo [saline] and granisetron [3 mg]; days 2 and 3, intravenous placebo). The primary endpoint was complete response, defined as the absence of grade ≥1 fever, anorexia, or nausea/vomiting according to the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (version 4.0) and no use of rescue therapy for 120 hours after TACE. A total of 120 patients between October 2010 and June 2013 were randomly assigned to treatment groups. Overall the complete response rate was greater with the dexamethasone regimen than with the control regimen (47.5%, 95% confidence interval 34.3%-60.9%, versus 10.2%, 95% confidence interval 3.8%-20.8%; P < 0.001). Cumulative incidences of fever, anorexia, and nausea/vomiting were higher in the control regimen group compared with the dexamethasone group (P < 0.001, P < 0.001, and P = 0.095, respectively).

213,Curative effect of transcatheter arterial chemoembolization combined with radiofrequency ablation in treating hepatic cell carcinoma and its effect on serum markers.,10.3233/CBM-160508,"BACKGROUND: Hepatic cell carcinoma (HCC) is more common in clinical practice, and has high malignant degree. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to analyze the curative effect of transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (TACE) combined with radiofrequency ablation (RFA) in treating hepatic cell carcinoma (HCC) and its effect on serum markers. METHODS: A total of 106 cases of patients with hepatic cell carcinoma treated in our hospital were randomly divided into two groups: observation group and control group. Patients in the observation group (53 cases) received transcatheter arterial chemoembolization combined with radiofrequency ablation therapy, while subjects in the control group (53 cases) received transcatheter arterial chemoembolization therapy. Differences in the overall effect, indicators of inflammation and oxidative stress, tumor activity-related indicators and tumor recurrence-related indicators between these two groups were compared. RESULTS: At one and two weeks after treatment, the number of cases of CR and PR in the observation group was higher than that in the control group, the number of cases of SD was not different from that in the control group, and the number of cases of PD was lower than that in the control group. At two weeks after treatment, differences in serum MDA, SOD, GSH, CRP, TNF-α and ESR between the two groups were significant. However, serum EC, VEGF, MMP, AFP, CA199 and GGT content was significantly lower in the observation group than that in the control group.

This phase I/II study compared the safety and efficacy of resminostat plus sorafenib versus sorafenib monotherapy as first-line therapy for advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: In phase I, resminostat (400 mg or 600 mg/day on days 1 to 5 every 14 days) was administered with sorafenib (800 mg/day for 14 days) to determine the recommended dose for phase II. In phase II, patients were randomized (1:1) to sorafenib monotherapy or resminostat plus sorafenib. The primary endpoint was time-to-progression (TTP). RESULTS: Nine patients (3: 400 mg, 6: 600 mg) were enrolled in phase I, and the recommended dose of resminostat was determined to be 400 mg/day. Then 170 patients were enrolled in phase II. Median TTP/overall survival (OS) were 2.8/14.1 months with monotherapy versus 2.8/11.8 months with combination therapy (Hazard Ratio [HR]: 0.984, p = 0.925/HR: 1.046, p = 0.824).

215,A Phase II and Biomarker Study of Sorafenib Combined with Modified FOLFOX in Patients with Advanced Hepatocellular Carcinoma.,10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-18-0847,"PURPOSE: Sorafenib is a standard first-line treatment for advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The phase III SHARP trial showed a median time-to-progression (mTTP) of 5.5 months, overall response rate (ORR) of 2%, and median overall survival (mOS) of 10.7 months with sorafenib. FOLFOX4 has shown modest activity in advanced HCC. We evaluated the combination of sorafenib and modified (m)FOLFOX in a single-arm, multicenter phase II study. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The study included Child-Pugh A patients with advanced HCC and no prior systemic therapies. Patients received sorafenib 400 mg twice a day for 2 weeks, followed by concurrent mFOLFOX [5-fluorouracil (5-FU) 1,200 mg/m(2)/day for 46 hours, leucovorin 200 mg/m(2), and oxaliplatin 85 mg/m(2) biweekly]. The primary endpoint was mTTP with an alternative hypothesis of 7 months, and secondary endpoints included ORR, mOS, and circulating biomarkers. RESULTS: The study enrolled 40 patients: HCV/EtOH/HBV, 43%/28%/13%; Child-Pugh A5, 70%. Notable grade 3/4 adverse events (AE) included AST/ALT elevation (28%/15%), diarrhea (13%), hyperbilirubinemia (10%), hand-foot syndrome (8%), and bleeding (8%). mTTP was 7.7 months [95% confidence interval (CI): 4.4-8.9], ORR 18%, and mOS 15.1 months (7.9-16.9). Sorafenib + mFOLFOX increased plasma PlGF, VEGF-D, sVEGFR1, IL12p70, and CAIX and CD4(+) and CD8(+) effector T lymphocytes and decreased plasma sVEGFR2 and s-c-KIT and regulatory T cells (Tregs). Shorter TTP was associated with high baseline sVEGFR1. Shorter TTP and OS were associated with increases in Tregs and CD56(Dim) natural killer (NK) cells after sorafenib alone and plasma sMET after combination treatment (all P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Sorafenib + mFOLFOX met the prespecified endpoint with encouraging efficacy but moderate hepatotoxicity.

However, no randomised phase 3 trial has tested the combination of sorafenib with continuous arterial infusion chemotherapy. We aimed to compare continuous hepatic arterial infusion chemotherapy plus sorafenib with sorafenib alone in patients with advanced, unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma. METHODS: We did an open-label, randomised, phase 3 trial (SILIUS) at 31 sites in Japan. Eligible patients were aged 20 years or older, with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma not suitable for resection, local ablation, or transarterial chemoembolisation; Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status 0-1; Child-Pugh score 7 or lower; and adequate bone marrow, liver, and renal function. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) via an interactive web response system with a computer-generated sequence to receive 400 mg sorafenib orally twice daily or 400 mg sorafenib orally twice daily plus hepatic arterial infusion chemotherapy (cisplatin 20 mg/m(2) on days 1 and 8 and fluorouracil 330 mg/m(2) continuously on days 1-5 and 8-12 of every 28-day cycle via an implanted catheter system). The primary endpoint was overall survival. The primary efficacy analysis comprised all randomised patients (the intention-to-treat population), and the safety analysis comprised all randomised patients who received at least one dose of study treatment.

We conducted a multi-center randomized phase II study comparing a sequential HAIC-sorafenib regimen versus sorafenib alone as an initial therapy for HCC. METHODS: Patients were randomly assigned (ratio, 1:1) to receive sequential HAIC with cisplatin followed by sorafenib (HAIC group, n = 35) or sorafenib alone (sorafenib group, n = 33) as an initial therapy. The primary endpoint was the one-year survival rate. Secondary endpoint included overall survival (OS), the 2-year survival rate, the time-to-progression (TTP), the objective response rate (ORR), the disease control rate (DCR), and safety. RESULTS: For the primary endpoint, the one-year survival rates were 46% in the HAIC group and 58% in the sorafenib group. The median OS period was 10.0 months (95% CI, 7.0-18.8) in the HAIC group and 15.2 months (95% CI, 8.2-19.7) in the sorafenib group (hazard ratio [HR], 1.08; 95% CI, 0.63 to 1.86, P = 0.78). The median TTP, ORR and DCR in the HAIC group were 2.8 months (95% CI, 1.7-5.5), 14.3, and 45.7%, respectively, while those in the sorafenib group were 3.9 months (95% CI, 2.3-6.8), 9.1, and 45.5%, respectively.

METHODS: In a randomized clinical trial, patients with HCC within the Milan criteria were included and randomized 1 : 1 to the partial hepatectomy group or the TACE + RFA group. The primary outcome was overall survival and the secondary outcome was recurrence-free survival. RESULTS: Two hundred patients were enrolled. The 1-, 3- and 5-year overall survival rates were 97·0, 83·7 and 61·9 per cent for the partial hepatectomy group, and 96·0, 67·2 and 45·7 per cent for the TACE + RFA group (P = 0·007). The 1-, 3- and 5-year recurrence-free survival rates were 94·0, 68·2 and 48·4 per cent, and 83·0, 44·9 and 35·5 per cent respectively (P = 0·026). On Cox proportional hazard regression analysis, HBV-DNA (hazard ratio (HR) 1·76; P = 0·006), platelet count (HR 1·00; P = 0·017) and tumour size (HR 1·90; P < 0·001) were independent prognostic factors for recurrence-free survival, and HBV-DNA (HR 1·61; P = 0·036) was a risk factor for overall survival. The incidence of complications in the partial hepatectomy group was higher than in the TACE + RFA group (23·0 versus 11·0 per cent respectively; P = 0·024).

220,Comparing stereotactic ablative radiotherapy (SABR) versus re-trans-catheter arterial chemoembolization (re-TACE) for hepatocellular carcinoma patients who had incomplete response after initial TACE (TASABR): a randomized controlled trial.,10.1186/s12885-019-5461-3,"BACKGROUND: Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) accounts for 75-85% of primary liver cancers and is prevalent in the Asia-Pacific region. Till now, trans-arterial chemoembolization (TACE) is still one of common modalities in managing unresectable intermediate-stage HCC. However, post-TACE residual viable HCC is not uncommon, resulting in unsatisfied overall survival after TACE alone. Recently, stereotactic ablative radiotherapy (SABR) has been suggested to manage HCC curatively. However, evidence from phase-III trials is largely lacking. Hence, the present phase III randomized trial is designed to compare clinical outcomes between SABR and re-TACE for unresectable HCC patients who had incomplete response after initial TACE. METHODS: The present study is an open-label, parallel, randomized controlled trial. A total of 120 patients will be included into two study groups, i.e., SABR and re-TACE, with a 1:1 allocation rate. A 3-year allocating period is planned. Patients with incomplete response after initial TACE will be enrolled and randomized. The primary endpoint is 1-year freedom-form-local-progression rate. Secondary endpoints are disease-progression-free survival, overall survival, local control, response rate, toxicity, and duration of response of the treated tumor. DISCUSSION: SABR has been reported as an effective modality in managing intermediate-stage HCC patients, but evidence from phase-III randomized trials is largely lacking. As a result, conducting randomized trials to demarcate the role of SABR in these patients is warranted, especially in the Asia-Pacific region, where HBV- and HCV-related HCCs are prevalent.

In recent years, transarterial chemoembolization, radiofrequency ablation, and microwave ablation (MWA) have been accepted as treatment modalities for patients with surgically unresectable HCC. AIM OF THIS WORK: This study aimed to compare combination treatment with radiofrequency or MWA, followed by transarterial chemoembolization, and performed in a single session. PATIENTS AND METHODS: This study was carried out on 50 patients with nonresectable single-lesion HCC, who were divided into three groups: group A included 20 patients treated by transcatheter hepatic arterial chemoembolization, group B included 20 patients treated by radiofrequency thermal ablation combined with transcatheter arterial chemoembolization, and group C included 10 patients treated by MWA combined with transcatheter arterial chemoembolization. The combined treatments were performed in a single session, with the ablation performed first. RESULTS: The total success rate in this study at 6 months following the procedure was 50% in group A, 70% in group B, and 80% in group C. Major complications were recorded in 22% of patients. The number of complications was the highest in group A. CONCLUSION: Combined ablation with chemoembolization is superior in the treatment of nonresectable single masses larger than 4 cm. Transcatheter arterial chemoembolization and ablation can be performed safely and successfully during a single session, which has not been found to decrease the response rates to treatment.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 812 patients with inoperable HCC were randomized (stable emulsion, n = 402; unstable emulsion, n = 410). The 2 emulsions were prepared by using the same protocol except that different solvents were used for chemotherapy agents, including epirubicin, lobaplatin, and mitomycin C. The solvent in the stable emulsion arm was contrast medium and distilled water, and the solvent in the unstable emulsion arm was distilled water. The primary endpoint was overall survival (OS), and secondary endpoints were time to progression (TTP), tumor response, adverse events (AEs), and plasma epirubicin concentrations. RESULTS: In vitro, stable emulsions did not occur until 1 day, and unstable emulsions, with a lower peak plasma concentration (P = .001) in vivo, exhibited rapid separation of the oil and aqueous phases after 10 minutes.

223,"Sorafenib with or without everolimus in patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC): a randomized multicenter, multinational phase II trial (SAKK 77/08 and SASL 29).",10.1093/annonc/mdw054,"BACKGROUND: Sorafenib (S), a multitargeted tyrosine kinase inhibitor, is the standard of care for first-line systemic treatment of advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Everolimus (E) is a potent inhibitor of mTOR, a pathway frequently activated in HCC. Preclinical data suggest that the combination S + E has additive effects compared with single-agent S. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients with unresectable or metastatic HCC and Child-Pugh ≤7 liver dysfunction were randomized to receive daily S 800 mg alone or with E 5 mg until progression or unacceptable toxicity. The primary end point was progression-free survival at 12 weeks (PFS12). The secondary end points included response rate, PFS, time to progression (TTP), overall survival (OS), duration of disease stabilization (DDS), safety, and quality-of-life (QoL) assessments. RESULTS: A total of 106 patients were randomized: 46 patients received S and 60 patients received S + E. Ninety-three patients were assessable for the primary end point and 105 patients for the safety analysis. The PFS12 rate was 70% [95% confidence interval (CI) 54-83] and 68% (95% CI 53-81) in patients randomized to S and S + E, respectively. The RECIST (mRECIST) response rate was 0% (23%) in the S arm and 10% (35%) in the S + E arm. Median PFS (6.6 versus 5.7 months), TTP (7.6 versus 6.3 months), DDS (6.7 versus 6.7 months), and OS (10 versus 12 months) were similar in the S and S + E arms, respectively. Grade 3/4 adverse events occurred in 72% and 86% of patients in arm S and arm S + E, respectively. Patients had similar QoL scores over time, except for a greater worsening in physical well-being and mood in the arm S + E. CONCLUSIONS: No evidence was found that S + E improves the efficacy compared with S alone. Combining 5 mg E with full-dose S is feasible, but more toxic than S alone. Further testing of this drug combination in molecularly unselected HCCs appears unwarranted. CLINICALTRIALSGOV: NCT01005199. Society for Medical Oncology. All rights reserved.

OBJECTIVE: To assess the efficacy of everolimus in patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma for whom sorafenib treatment failed. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: EVOLVE-1 was a randomized, double-blind, phase 3 study conducted among 546 adults with Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer stage B or C hepatocellular carcinoma and Child-Pugh A liver function whose disease progressed during or after sorafenib or who were intolerant of sorafenib. Patients were enrolled from 17 countries between May 2010 and March 2012. Randomization was stratified by region (Asia vs rest of world) and macrovascular invasion (present vs absent). INTERVENTIONS: Everolimus, 7.5 mg/d, or matching placebo, both given in combination with best supportive care and continued until disease progression or intolerable toxicity. Per the 2:1 randomization scheme, 362 patients were randomized to the everolimus group and 184 patients to the placebo group. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary end point was overall survival. Secondary end points included time to progression and the disease control rate (the percentage of patients with a best overall response of complete or partial response or stable disease). RESULTS: No significant difference in overall survival was seen between treatment groups, with 303 deaths (83.7%) in the everolimus group and 151 deaths (82.1%) in the placebo group (hazard ratio [HR], 1.05; 95% CI, 0.86-1.27; P = .68; median overall survival, 7.6 months with everolimus, 7.3 months with placebo). Median time to progression with everolimus and placebo was 3.0 months and 2.6 months, respectively (HR, 0.93; 95% CI, 0.75-1.15), and disease control rate was 56.1% and 45.1%, respectively (P = .01). The most common grade 3/4 adverse events for everolimus vs placebo were anemia (7.8% vs 3.3%, respectively), asthenia (7.8% vs 5.5%, respectively), and decreased appetite (6.1% vs 0.5%, respectively). No patients experienced hepatitis C viral flare. Based on central laboratory results, hepatitis B viral reactivation was experienced by 39 patients (29 everolimus, 10 placebo); all cases were asymptomatic, but 3 everolimus recipients discontinued therapy. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Everolimus did not improve overall survival in patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma whose disease progressed during or after receiving sorafenib or who were intolerant of sorafenib.

225,Influence of preoperative transcatheter arterial chemoembolization on gene expression in the HIF-1α pathway in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma.,10.1007/s00432-014-1713-4,"PURPOSE: Although transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (TACE) is the most common treatment option in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), its clinical benefits remain still controversial. Since TACE induces hypoxic necrosis in tumors, hypoxia-inducible factor 1α (HIF-1α) could critically affect biology in residual tumors after TACE treatment and subsequent prognosis. However, HIF-1α and its prognostic relevance in TACE have rarely been examined in human specimens. In the current study, we investigated the prognosis and expression of genes regulated by HIF-1α in HCC patients receiving preoperative TACE for the first time. METHODS: In total, 35 patients with HCC (10 patients undergoing preoperative TACE) were retrospectively studied. The prognostic significance of TACE was analyzed using Kaplan-Meier and Cox regression models. Protein levels of HIF-1α and mRNA levels of HIF-1α-associated genes were examined using immunohistochemistry (IHC) and real-time RT-PCR, respectively. RESULTS: Preoperative TACE was significantly associated with increased 2-year recurrence rate (80 vs. 36 %, P = 0.00402) and shorter disease-free survival (DFS) time (11.9 vs. 35.7 months, P = 0.0182). TACE was an independent prognostic factor for recurrence (P = 0.007) and poor DFS (P = 0.010) in a multivariate analysis. Immunohistochemical staining revealed in vivo activation of HIF-1α in human specimens treated with TACE. Notably, protein levels of HIF-1α were significantly increased in TACE tissues demonstrated by IHC. Transcriptional targets of HIF-1α showed mRNA expression patterns consistent with activation of HIF-1α in TACE tissues.

Health outcomes were measured as quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). With TreeAge software, the disease process was modeled as three health states: progression-free survival (PFS), progressive disease (PD), and death. Costs were extracted from the REACH-2 trial, and utility was derived from published literature. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) were calculated to compare ramucirumab with placebo. Probabilistic sensitivity analyses were developed to examine the robustness of the results.Results: In the base case analysis, ramucirumab therapy had a cost of $55,508.41 and generated 0.54 QALYs, while placebo therapy had a cost of $761.09 and generated 0.47 QALYs, leading to an additional $54,747.32 in costs and 0.07 QALYs. The ICER was $782,104.57 per QALY, which was much higher than the willingness-to-pay threshold of $100,000 per QALY. According to sensitivity analyses, the utility of PD in the two groups was the dominant parameter influencing the ICER.Conclusion: Although ramucirumab was associated with prolonged survival for patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma who progressed on sorafenib treatment with an AFP of at least 400 ng/ml, it is not a cost-effective treatment from a United States payer perspective.",Zheng H; Qin Z; Qiu X; Zhan M; Wen F; Xu T,False,Intervention is not immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs),patients with HCC who progressed on sorafenib with AFP ≥400 ng/ml,ramucirumab,placebo,"quality-adjusted life years, cost-effectiveness",Markov model analysis,False,"Model A correctly identified that the intervention is not immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs).

Materials and Methods This trial was approved by the Fudan University Zhongshan Hospital ethics committee and was registered with the Chinese Clinical Trial Registry (ChiCTR-TRC-11001643). After informed consent was obtained, 228 patients with advanced HCC (Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer stage C) were randomly assigned to receive an Rg3 capsule and undergo TACE (n = 152; mean age ± standard deviation, 52.4 years ± 11.8; 84.2% men) or undergo TACE alone (n = 76; mean age, 52.4 years ± 10.4; 82.9% men). TACE was performed by using iodized oil with epirubicin and gelatin sponge after oxaliplatin and 5-fluorouracil were infused. The primary end point was overall survival. Secondary end points included time to progression, time to untreatable progression, disease control rate, and safety. Data were compared with the log-rank test, and survival curves were generated with the Kaplan-Meier method. Results Median overall survival was 13.2 months (95% confidence interval [CI]: 11.15, 15.26) in the TACE with Rg3 group and 10.1 months (95% CI: 9.14, 11.06) in the control group (hazard ratio, 0.63 [95% CI: 0.46, 0.85]; P = .002). Median time to progression (4.3 vs 3.2 months, respectively; P = .151) and median time to untreatable progression (8.3 vs 7.3 months, respectively; P = .063) were similar in the two groups. Disease control rate was 69.7% in the TACE with Rg3 group versus 51.3% in the control group (P = .012). Constipation and epistaxis were more frequent in the Rg3 with TACE group (P < .05). Importantly, Rg3 alleviated some TACE-related adverse syndromes and blood anomalies.

METHODS: Eligible patients were randomly assigned in a 2:1 ratio to receive AEG35156 (300 mg weekly intravenous infusion) in combination with sorafenib (400 mg twice daily orally) or sorafenib alone. The primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS). Other endpoints include overall survival (OS), objective response rates (ORR), and safety profile. RESULTS: A total of 51 patients were enrolled; of them, 48 were evaluable. At a median follow-up of 16.2 months, the median PFS and OS were 4.0 months (95% CI, 1.2-4.1) and 6.5 months (95% CI, 3.9-11.5) for combination arm, and 2.6 (95% CI, 1.2-5.4) and 5.4 months (95% CI, 4.3-11.2) for sorafenib arm. Patients who had the study treatment interrupted or had dose modifications according to protocol did significantly better, in terms of PFS and OS, than those who had no dose reduction in combination arm and those in sorafenib arm.

229,Single administration of Selective Internal Radiation Therapy versus continuous treatment with sorafeNIB in locally advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (SIRveNIB): study protocol for a phase iii randomized controlled trial.,,"BACKGROUND: Approximately 20 % of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients diagnosed in the early stages may benefit from potentially curative ablative therapies such as surgical resection, transplantation or radiofrequency ablation. For patients not eligible for such options, prognosis is poor. Sorafenib and Selective Internal Radiation Therapy (SIRT) are clinically proven treatment options in patients with unresectable HCC, and this study aims to assess overall survival following either SIRT or Sorafenib therapy for locally advanced HCC patients. METHODS: This investigator-initiated, multi-centre, open-label, randomized, controlled trial will enrol 360 patients with locally advanced HCC, as defined by Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer stage B or stage C, without distant metastases, and which is not amenable to immediate curative treatment. Exclusion criteria include previous systemic therapy, metastatic disease, complete occlusion of the main portal vein, or a Child-Pugh score of >7. Eligible patients will be randomised 1:1 and stratified by centre and presence or absence of portal vein thrombosis to receive either a single administration of SIRT using yttrium-90 resin microspheres (SIR-Spheres®, Sirtex Medical Limited, Sydney, Australia) targeted at HCC in the liver by the trans-arterial route or continuous oral Sorafenib (Nexavar®, Bayer Pharma AG, Berlin, Germany) at a dose of 400 mg twice daily until disease progression, no further response, complete regression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients for both the Sorafenib and SIRT arms will be followed-up every 4 weeks for the first 3 months and 12 weekly thereafter. Overall survival is the primary endpoint, assessed for the intention-to-treat population. Secondary endpoints are tumour response rate, time-to-tumour progression, progression free survival, quality of life and down-staging to receive potentially curative therapy. DISCUSSION: Definitive data comparing these two therapies will help to determine clinical practice in the large group of patients with locally advanced HCC and improve outcomes for such patients.

230,Selective internal radiotherapy (SIRT) versus transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) for the treatment of intrahepatic cholangiocellular carcinoma (CCC): study protocol for a randomized controlled trial.,10.1186/1745-6215-15-311,"BACKGROUND: Cholangiocellular carcinoma is the second most common primary liver cancer after hepatocellular carcinoma. Over the last 30 years, the incidence of intrahepatic cholangiocellular carcinoma has risen continuously worldwide. Meanwhile, the intrahepatic cholangiocellular carcinoma has become more common than the extrahepatic growth type and currently accounts for 10-15% of all primary hepatic malignancies. Intrahepatic cholangiocellular carcinoma is typically diagnosed in advanced stages due to late clinical symptoms and an absence of classic risk factors. A late diagnosis precludes curative surgical resection. There is evidence that transarterial chemoembolization leads to better local tumor control and prolongs survival compared to systemic chemotherapy. New data indicates that selective internal radiotherapy, also referred to as radioembolization, provides promising results for treating intrahepatic cholangiocellular carcinoma. METHODS/DESIGN: This pilot study is a randomized, controlled, single center, phase II trial. Twenty-four patients with intrahepatic cholangiocellular carcinoma will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive either chemoembolization or radioembolization. Randomization will be stratified according to tumor load. Progression-free survival is the primary endpoint; overall survival and time to progression are secondary endpoints. To evaluate treatment success, patients will receive contrast enhanced magnetic resonance imaging every 3 months. DISCUSSION: Currently, chemoembolization is routinely performed in many centers instead of systemic chemotherapy for treating intrahepatic cholangiocellular carcinoma confined to the liver. Recently, radioembolization has been increasingly applied to cholangiocellular carcinoma as second line therapy after TACE failure or even as an alternative first line therapy. Nonetheless, no randomized studies have compared radioembolization and chemoembolization. Considering all this background information, we recognized a strong need for a randomized controlled trial (RCT) to compare the two treatments. Therefore, the present protocol describes the design of a RCT that compares SIRT and TACE as the first line therapy for inoperable CCC confined to the liver.

231,Randomized Clinical Trial Comparing Proton Beam Radiation Therapy with Transarterial Chemoembolization for Hepatocellular Carcinoma: Results of an Interim Analysis.,10.1016/j.ijrobp.2016.02.027,"PURPOSE: To describe results of a planned interim analysis of a prospective, randomized clinical trial developed to compare treatment outcomes among patients with newly diagnosed hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). METHODS AND MATERIALS: Eligible subjects had either clinical or pathologic diagnosis of HCC and met either Milan or San Francisco transplant criteria. Patients were randomly assigned to transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) or to proton beam radiation therapy. Patients randomized to TACE received at least 1 TACE with additional TACE for persistent disease. Proton beam radiation therapy was delivered to all areas of gross disease to a total dose of 70.2 Gy in 15 daily fractions over 3 weeks. The primary endpoint was progression-free survival, with secondary endpoints of overall survival, local tumor control, and treatment-related toxicities as represented by posttreatment days of hospitalization. RESULTS: At the time of this analysis 69 subjects were available for analysis. Of these, 36 were randomized to TACE and 33 to proton. Total days of hospitalization within 30 days of TACE/proton was 166 and 24 days, respectively (P<.001). Ten TACE and 12 proton patients underwent liver transplantation after treatment. Viable tumor identified in the explanted livers after TACE/proton averaged 2.4 and 0.9 cm, respectively. Pathologic complete response after TACE/proton was 10%/25% (P=.38). The 2-year overall survival for all patients was 59%, with no difference between treatment groups. Median survival time was 30 months (95% confidence interval 20.7-39.3 months). There was a trend toward improved 2-year local tumor control (88% vs 45%, P=.06) and progression-free survival (48% vs 31%, P=.06) favoring the proton beam treatment group.

METHODS: Eligible patients had advanced HCC, Child-Pugh A, PS 0 or 1 and prior sorafenib. Patients received ramucirumab (8 mg/kg) or placebo (1:1) on day 1 of a 2-week cycle. QoL was assessed by FACT Hepatobiliary Symptom Index (FHSI)-8 and EuroQoL (EQ-5D) at baseline; cycles 4, 10, and 16; and end of treatment. PS was assessed at baseline, each cycle, and end of treatment. Deterioration in FHSI-8 was defined as a ≥3-point decrease from baseline and PS deterioration was defined as a change of ≥2. Both intention-to-treat and pre-specified subgroup of patients with baseline serum alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) ≥400 ng/mL were assessed. RESULTS: There were 565 patients randomised to ramucirumab and placebo. Compliance with FHSI and EQ-5D was high and similar between groups. In the ITT population, deterioration in FHSI-8, EQ-5D, and PS was similar between ramucirumab and placebo. In patients with baseline AFP ≥400 ng/mL, ramucirumab significantly reduced deterioration in FHSI-8 at the end of treatment compared with placebo (P = 0.0381), and there was a trend towards a delay in the deterioration of symptoms in FHSI-8 (HR 0.690; P = 0.054) and PS (HR 0.642; P = 0.057) in favour of ramucirumab. CONCLUSIONS: We report one of the most comprehensive data sets of QoL and symptom burden in patients undergoing systemic therapy for advanced HCC. Ramucirumab was associated with no worsening of QoL.

233,A new angiographic imaging platform reduces radiation exposure for patients with liver cancer treated with transarterial chemoembolization.,10.1007/s00330-015-3717-0,"OBJECTIVES: To quantify the reduction of radiation liver cancer patients are exposed to during transarterial chemoembolization (TACE), while maintaining diagnostic image quality, using a new C-arm imaging platform. METHODS: In this prospective, HIPAA-compliant, IRB-approved, two-arm trial, 78 consecutive patients with primary or secondary liver cancer were treated with TACE on a C-arm imaging platform before and after an upgrade incorporating optimized acquisition parameters and advanced real-time image processing algorithms. Dose area product (DAP) and radiation time of each digital fluoroscopy (DF), digital subtraction angiography (DSA) and cone beam CT (CBCT) were recorded. DSA image quality was assessed by two blinded and independent readers on a four-rank scale. RESULTS: Both cohorts showed no significant differences with regard to patient characteristics and tumour burden. The new system resulted in a statistically significant reduction of cumulative DAP of 66% compared to the old platform (median 132.9 vs. 395.8 Gy cm(2)). Individually, DAP of DF, DSA and CBCT decreased by 52%, 79% and 15% (p < 0.01, p < 0.01, p = 0.51), respectively.

234,Phase I/II Randomized Trial of Sorafenib and Bevacizumab as First-Line Therapy in Patients with Locally Advanced or Metastatic Hepatocellular Carcinoma: North Central Cancer Treatment Group Trial N0745 (Alliance).,10.1007/s11523-016-0467-0,"BACKGROUND: Angiogenesis has been a major target of novel drug development in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). It is hypothesized that the combination of two antiangiogenic agents, sorafenib and bevacizumab, will provide greater blockade of angiogenesis. OBJECTIVE: To determine the optimal dose, safety, and effectiveness of dual anti-angiogenic therapy with sorafenib and bevacizumab in patients with advanced HCC. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients with locally advanced or metastatic HCC not amenable for surgery or liver transplant were eligible. The phase I starting dose level was bevacizumab 1.25 mg/kg day 1 and 15 plus sorafenib 400 mg twice daily (BID) days 1-28. In the phase II portion, patients were randomized to receive bevacizumab and sorafenib at the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) or sorafenib 400 mg BID. RESULTS: Seventen patients were enrolled in the phase I component. Dose-limiting toxicities included grade 3 hand/foot skin reaction, fatigue, hypertension, alanine/aspartate aminotransferase increase, dehydration, hypophosphatemia, creatinine increase, hypoglycemia, nausea/vomiting, and grade 4 hyponatremia. Seven patients were enrolled in the phase II component at the MTD: sorafenib 200 mg BID days 1-28 and bevacizumab 2.5 mg/kg every other week; 57% (4/7) had grade 3 AEs at least possibly related to treatment. No responses were observed in the phase II portion. Estimated median time to progression and survival were 8.6 months (95% CI: 0.4-16.3) and 13.3 months (95% CI 4.4 - not estimable), respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The MTD of the combination is sorafenib 200 mg twice daily on days 1-28 plus bevacizumab 2.5 mg/kg on days 1 and 15 of a 28-day cycle. In the phase II portion of the trial, concerns regarding excessive toxicity, low efficacy, and slow enrollment led to discontinuation of the trial.

METHODS: A single center study enrolled 41 patients treated with systemic sorafenib, 400 mg twice a day, combined with DEB TACE. All patients had a pre-treatment and 3-4 week post-treatment MRI. Anatomic response criteria (RECIST, mRECIST and EASL) and volumetric functional response (ADC, enhancement) were assessed. Statistical analyses included paired Student's t-test, Kaplan-Meier curves, Cohen's Kappa, and multivariate cox proportional hazard model. RESULTS: Median tumour size by RECIST remained unchanged post-treatment (8.3 ± 4.1 cm vs. 8.1 ± 4.3 cm, p = 0.44). There was no significant survival difference for early response by RECIST (p = 0.93). EASL and mRECIST could not be analyzed in 12 patients. Volumetric ADC increased significantly (1.32 × 10(-3) mm(2)/sec to 1.60 × 10(-3) mm(2)/sec, p < 0.001), and volumetric enhancement decreased significantly in HAP (38.2% to 17.6%, p < 0.001) and PVP (76.6% to 41.2%, p < 0.005). Patients who demonstrated ≥ 65% decrease PVP enhancement had significantly improved overall survival compared to non-responders (p < 0.005).

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients with advanced HCC (stratified by Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer stage and Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status) were randomized 1:1 to receive sorafenib (400 mg, twice daily per 21-day cycle) and either placebo (placebo-sorafenib arm) or mapatumumab (30 mg/kg on day 1 per 21-day cycle; mapatumumab-sorafenib arm). The primary end point was time to (radiologic) progression (TTP), assessed by blinded independent central review. Key secondary end points included progression-free survival, overall survival, and objective response. RESULTS: In total, 101 patients were randomized (placebo-sorafenib arm: N = 51; mapatumumab-sorafenib arm: N = 50). There was no significant difference in median TTP between both arms [5.6 versus 4.1 months, respectively; adjusted hazard ratio (one-sided 90% confidence interval) 1.192 (0-1.737)]. No mapatumumab-related benefit was identified when TTP was evaluated in the stratified subgroups. The addition of mapatumumab to sorafenib did not demonstrate improvement in the secondary efficacy end points. The reported frequency of adverse events (AEs) and serious AEs was comparable in both treatment arms. CONCLUSIONS: The addition of mapatumumab to sorafenib did not improve TTP or other efficacy end points, nor did it substantially change the toxicity profile of sorafenib in patients with advanced HCC.

In this phase II study, safety and tolerability of the combination of tigatuzumab and sorafenib was evaluated in patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma. METHODS: Adults with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma, measurable disease, and an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance score⩽1 were enrolled. Eligible subjects were randomly assigned 1:1:1 to tigatuzumab (6 mg/kg loading, 2 mg/kg/week maintenance) plus sorafenib 400 mg twice daily; tigatuzumab (6 mg/kg loading, 6 mg/kg/week maintenance) plus sorafenib 400 mg twice daily; or sorafenib 400 mg twice daily. The primary end point was time to progression. Secondary end points included overall survival and safety. RESULTS: 163 subjects were randomized to treatment. Median time to progression was 3.0 months in the tigatuzumab 6/2 mg/kg combination group (p=0.988 vs. sorafenib), 3.9 months in the tigatuzumab 6/6 mg/kg combination group (p=0.586 vs. sorafenib), and 2.8 months in the sorafenib alone group. Median overall survival was 12.2 months in the tigatuzumab 6/6 mg/kg combination group (p=0.659 vs. sorafenib), vs. 8.2 months in both other treatment groups (p=0.303, tigatuzumab 6/2 mg/kg combination vs. sorafenib). The most common treatment-emergent adverse events were palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia syndrome, diarrhea, and decreased appetite.

MATERIALS AND METHODS:  Written consent was waived for this IRB-approved retrospective study. 29 patients (20 men; mean age: 65.7 ± 11.5 years) with malignant liver lesions underwent 4D-CTA, prior to initial TACE. Time-resolved volume-rendering technique (VRT), maximum-intensity projection (MIP), and multiplanar reconstruction (MPR) series were reconstructed, enabling a direct selective catheterization of the tumor-supplying artery without prior conventional digital subtraction angiography (DSA). 29 patients (16 men; mean age: 69.4 ± 13.9) who underwent traditional TACE served as the control group. The amount of administered contrast media, operator radiation exposure, and catheter consumption during TACE were compared. Two radiologists assessed diagnostic confidence in the exclusion of portal vein thrombosis. RESULTS:  4D-CTA TACE resulted in a significant reduction in the amount of contrast media used, compared to traditional TACE (-61.0 ml/ -66.3 % intra-arterial, -12.8 ml/ -13.8 % overall; P < 0.001). The dose-area product indicating operator radiation exposure during intervention was reduced by 50.5 % (P < 0.001), and 0.7 fewer catheters on average were used (P = 0.063), while 4D-CTA data was available to guide TACE. Diagnostic confidence in the exclusion of portal vein thrombosis was significantly enhanced by 4D-CTA, compared to traditional DSA images (scores, 3.9 and 2.4, respectively; P < 0.001). CONCLUSION:  Dynamic 4D-CTA enables TACE with a substantially reduced amount of contrast material, decreases operator radiation exposure, and increases diagnostic confidence in the exclusion of portal vein thrombosis.

METHODS: From 04/2010-07/2012, 24 patients with histologically proven unresectable N0, M0 HCCs were randomized 1:1 to receive SIRT or DEB-TACE. SIRT could be repeated once in case of recurrence; while, TACE was repeated every 6 weeks until no viable tumor tissue was detected by MRI or contraindications prohibited further treatment. Patients were followed-up by MRI every 3 months; the final evaluation was 05/2013. RESULTS: Both groups were comparable in demographics (SIRT: 8males/4females, mean age 72 ± 7 years; TACE: 10males/2females, mean age 71 ± 9 years), initial tumor load (1 patient ≥25 % in each group), and BCLC (Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer) stage (SIRT: 12×B; TACE 1×A, 11×B). Median progression-free survival (PFS) was 180 days for SIRT versus 216 days for TACE patients (p = 0.6193) with a median TTP of 371 days versus 336 days, respectively (p = 0.5764). Median OS was 592 days for SIRT versus 788 days for TACE patients (p = 0.9271). Seven patients died in each group.

METHODS: Fifty HCC patients (36 men; 57 ± 11 years) undergoing repetitive TACE were first randomly assigned to receive a TACE treatment on a reference X-ray system or a low-dose system with advanced real-time image processing. The alternate system was used for a repeated TACE (treatment interval, 0.5-6 months). Fluoroscopy time, number of digital subtraction angiography (DSA), air kerma (AK), and dose area product (DAP) were compared between the two systems and between the two repetitive TACE. Three interventional radiologists independently rated the image quality in blinded offline readings. RESULTS: Fluoroscopy time (8.7 ± 5.9 minutes vs. 8.7 ± 7.9 minutes, P = .981), numbers of DSA runs (6 ± 4 vs. 6 ± 4, P = .735), and exposure images (173 ± 86 vs. 168 ± 91, P = .916) were equivalent between the two systems. No statistical difference in X-ray usage was found between repeated treatments. Compared to the reference system, the technology significantly reduced AK and DAP by 48.6% (0.17 ± 0.13 Gy vs. 0.41 ± 0.36 Gy, P < .0001) and 50.3% (77.3 ± 55.2 Gy cm(2) vs. 195.0 ± 155.5 Gy cm(2), P < .0001), respectively.

246,Randomized clinical control study of locoregional therapy combined with arsenic trioxide for the treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma.,10.1002/cncr.29456,"BACKGROUND: The objective of this study was to determine the efficacy and safety of locoregional therapy (LRT) combined with arsenic trioxide (As2 O3 ) treatment in primary hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients. METHODS: One hundred twenty-five primary HCC patients were recruited for a randomized controlled study. Patients were randomly divided into group A (n = 61) and group B (n = 64). All patients received transarterial chemoembolization. Group A patients were given As2 O3 at 10 mg/d for 4 courses (21 days per course) with a 2-week interval between courses. Survival times, therapeutic responses, extrahepatic metastases, and adverse events were recorded. RESULTS: A better therapeutic response was found in group A patients, as shown by higher objective response rate (ORR) and clinical benefit rate (CBR) values in group A versus group B (ORR, 81.96% [95% confidence interval (CI), 72.32%-91.62%] vs 59.37% [95% CI, 47.34%-71.41%], χ(2) = 7.650, P < .05; CBR, 95.08% [95% CI, 89.66%-100.00%] vs 81.25% [95% CI, 71.69%-90.81%], χ(2)  = 5.659, P < .05).

247,mRECIST to predict survival in advanced hepatocellular carcinoma: Analysis of two randomised phase II trials comparing nintedanib vs sorafenib.,10.1111/liv.13359,"BACKGROUND & AIMS: Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) has been shown to be a poor surrogate for survival benefit with targeted therapy in advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). METHODS: We investigated whether response evaluated using modified RECIST (mRECIST) predicted overall survival (OS) using data from two Phase II clinical trials. Analyses were conducted on pooled data from 188 patients with advanced HCC treated with nintedanib or sorafenib, of whom 180 were evaluable for response. Cox regression and Kaplan-Meier survival analyses were used to explore differences in OS between the responders and non-responders according to RECIST 1.0 and mRECIST criteria. Multivariate Cox proportional hazards models, including factors known to influence survival, were used to compare survival according to RECIST and mRECIST response. RESULTS: Discordance between RECIST and mRECIST evaluation was most common for assessment of partial response (12.2%) and stable disease (13.3%). OS was significantly longer in patients with response compared to patients without response-RECIST: hazard ratio (HR) 0.325 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.130-0.815), P=.0122; mRECIST: HR 0.544 (95% CI 0.335-0.881), P=.0122.

248,"Tivantinib for second-line treatment of MET-high, advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (METIV-HCC): a final analysis of a phase 3, randomised, placebo-controlled study.",10.1016/S1470-2045(18)30146-3,"BACKGROUND: Tivantinib (ARQ 197), a selective, oral MET inhibitor, improved overall survival and progression-free survival compared with placebo in a randomised phase 2 study in patients with high MET expression (MET-high) hepatocellular carcinoma previously treated with sorafenib. The aim of this phase 3 study was to confirm the results of the phase 2 trial. METHODS: We did a phase 3, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled study in 90 centres in Australia, the Americas, Europe, and New Zealand. Eligible patients were 18 years or older and had unresectable, histologically confirmed, hepatocellular carcinoma, an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0-1, high MET expression (MET-high; staining intensity score ≥2 in ≥50% of tumour cells), Child-Pugh A cirrhosis, and radiographically-confirmed disease progression after receiving sorafenib-containing systemic therapy. We randomly assigned patients (2:1) in block sizes of three using a computer-generated randomisation sequence to receive oral tivantinib (120 mg twice daily) or placebo (twice daily); patients were stratified by vascular invasion, extrahepatic spread, and α-fetoprotein concentrations (≤200 ng/mL or >200 ng/mL). The primary endpoint was overall survival in the intention-to-treat population. Efficacy analyses were by intention to treat and safety analyses were done in all patients who received any amount of study drug. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01755767. FINDINGS: Between Dec 27, 2012, and Dec 10, 2015, 340 patients were randomly assigned to receive tivantinib (n=226) or placebo (n=114). At a median follow-up of 18·1 months (IQR 14·1-23·1), median overall survival was 8·4 months (95% CI 6·8-10·0) in the tivantinib group and 9·1 months (7·3-10·4) in the placebo group (hazard ratio 0·97; 95% CI 0·75-1·25; p=0·81). Grade 3 or worse treatment-emergent adverse events occurred in 125 (56%) of 225 patients in the tivantinib group and in 63 (55%) of 114 patients in the placebo group, with the most common being ascites (16 [7%] patients]), anaemia (11 [5%] patients), abdominal pain (nine [4%] patients), and neutropenia (nine [4%] patients) in the tivantinib group. 50 (22%) of 226 patients in the tivantinib group and 18 (16%) of 114 patients in the placebo group died within 30 days of the last dose of study medication, and general deterioration (eight [4%] patients) and hepatic failure (four [2%] patients) were the most common causes of death in the tivantinib group. Three (1%) of 225 patients in the tivantinib group died from a treatment-related adverse event (one sepsis, one anaemia and acute renal failure, and one acute coronary syndrome). INTERPRETATION: Tivantinib did not improve overall survival compared with placebo in patients with MET-high advanced hepatocellular carcinoma previously treated with sorafenib. Although this METIV-HCC trial was negative, the study shows the feasibility of doing integral tissue biomarker studies in patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma. Additional randomised studies are needed to establish whether MET inhibition could be a potential therapy for some subsets of patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma.

249,Covariate-adjusted analysis of the Phase 3 REFLECT study of lenvatinib versus sorafenib in the treatment of unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma.,10.1038/s41416-020-0817-7,"BACKGROUND: In the Phase 3 REFLECT trial in patients with unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (uHCC), the multitargeted tyrosine kinase inhibitor, lenvatinib, was noninferior to sorafenib in the primary outcome of overall survival. Post-hoc review revealed imbalances in prognostic variables between treatment arms. Here, we re-analyse overall survival data from REFLECT to adjust for the imbalance in covariates. METHODS: Univariable and multivariable adjustments were undertaken for a candidate set of covariate values that a physician panel indicated could be prognostically associated with overall survival in uHCC. The values included baseline variables observed pre- and post-randomisation. Univariable analyses were based on a stratified Cox model. The multivariable analysis used a ""forwards stepwise"" Cox model. RESULTS: Univariable analysis identified alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) as the most influential variable. The chosen multivariable Cox model analysis resulted in an estimated adjusted hazard ratio for lenvatinib of 0.814 (95% CI: 0.699-0.948) when only baseline variables were included. Adjusting for post-randomisation treatment variables further increased the estimated superiority of lenvatinib. CONCLUSIONS: Covariate adjustment of REFLECT suggests that the original noninferiority trial likely underestimated the true effect of lenvatinib on overall survival due to an imbalance in baseline prognostic covariates and the greater use of post-treatment therapies in the sorafenib arm.

250,Left radial vs right femoral: comparison between arterial accesses in c-TACE procedures in terms of operator radiations exposure and patient comfort.,10.1007/s11547-024-01906-8,"PURPOSE: This multicenter prospective study aims to compare transradial access versus transfemoral access in conventional transarterial chemoembolization (c-TACE) procedures, focusing on operators radiations exposure, patients comfort, technical success and vascular access complications. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients were affected by hepatocellularcarcinoma (HCC) in intermediate stage or previous stages unfit for ablation and/or surgery; they were randomized into two groups according to arterial access site (Group F: right femoral access in standard position; Group R: radial access with left arm abduced 90°). Overall fluoroscopy time was recorded. Eight thermoluminescence dosimeters were positioned immediately before each procedure to monitor radiation doses. Technical success was intended as complete HCC nodules lipiodolization at final plain cone-beam CT. RESULTS: Group F included 23 patients, while group R 19. Mean fluoroscopy time was lower in group F but difference was not statistically significant (p-value > 0.05). In terms of operators radiations exposure, no significant differences were found (p-value > 0.05). Technical success was obtained in 81.5% in group F and 84.8% in group R, without significant differences (p-value > 0.05). Patients discomfort was significantly (p-value < 0.05) higher in group F. Concerning minor complications, no statistical differences were appreciated (p-value > 0.05); no major complications occurred. CONCLUSIONS: In this study, no statistical differences were observed in terms of operators radiations exposure, fluoroscopy time and technical success during c-TACE performed with left radial access compared to right femoral access; patients comfort was significantly better with radial access.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: This study was approved by the institutional review board, and written informed consent was obtained prior to inclusion. A total of 40 patients (20 patients per group, all 18 years or older) with histologically confirmed early- or intermediate-stage HCC and Child-Pugh class A or B cirrhosis were scheduled for inclusion. The primary endpoint was radiologic progression at 12 months according to European Association for the Study of the Liver criteria. Secondary endpoints were safety and overall survival (OS). Patients underwent cTACE with doxorubicin and intravenous administration of a placebo (cTACE-C) or bevacizumab (cTACE-B) (5 mg per kilogram of body weight) every 2 weeks for 52 weeks. After the first TACE procedure, TACE was repeated twice in 4-week intervals if indicated and technically feasible and on demand thereafter. Statistical analyses were performed with statistical software. P < .05 indicated a significant difference. RESULTS: Thirty-two patients were recruited between January 2006 and December 2009 (29 male, three female; mean age, 61 years ± 8 [standard deviation]; Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer stage A, n = 4; Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer stage B, n = 28; predominant cause, alcohol [n = 15]; Child-Pugh class A disease, n = 22; Child-Pugh class B disease, n = 10; 16 patients received bevacizumab; 16 patients received a placebo). Patients underwent a median of three TACE cycles and received 13 infusions of bevacizumab versus 11 infusions of the placebo before the trial was stopped prematurely for safety reasons. Severe (grade 3-5) septic (n = 8 vs n = 3) and vascular (n = 9 vs n = 0) side effects were observed almost exclusively in the cTACE-B group. Median survival was worse in the cTACE-B group than in the cTACE-C group (5.3 vs 13.7 months; hazard ratio [HR], 1.7; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.8, 3.6; P = .195) and reached significance in patients with Child-Pugh class A cirrhosis (7.3 vs 26.5 months; HR, 2.6; 95% CI: 1.0, 6.6; P = .049). The primary endpoint was not met, since there was no difference in radiologic response between the groups at 3, 6, or 12 months. CONCLUSION: No improvement in radiologic tumor response or OS was observed in patients with HCC who received cTACE and bevacizumab, but severe and even lethal septic and vascular side effects occurred.

This study was done to evaluate the efficacy of orantinib combined with conventional transcatheter arterial chemoembolisation (cTACE) in patients with unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma. METHODS: This randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 3 study was done at 75 sites in Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan. Patients with unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma, no extra-hepatic tumour spread, and Child-Pugh score of 6 or less were randomly assigned (1:1) by interactive web response system using a computer-generated sequence to receive orantinib or placebo, within 28 days of cTACE. Randomisation was stratified by region, Child-Pugh score (5 vs 6), alpha fetoprotein concentrations (<400 ng/mL vs ≥400 ng/mL), and size of the largest lesion (≤50 mm vs >50 mm). Orantinib at 200 mg, twice per day, or placebo was given orally until TACE failure or unacceptable toxicity. The patients, investigators, and study personnel were masked to treatment assignment.

253,The TRENDY multi-center randomized trial on hepatocellular carcinoma - Trial QA including automated treatment planning and benchmark-case results.,10.1016/j.radonc.2017.09.007,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The TRENDY trial is an international multi-center phase-II study, randomizing hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients between transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) and stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) with a target dose of 48-54 Gy in six fractions. The radiotherapy quality assurance (QA) program, including prospective plan feedback based on automated treatment planning, is described and results are reported. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Scans of a single patient were used as a benchmark case. Contours submitted by nine participating centers were compared with reference contours. The subsequent planning round was based on a single set of contours. A total of 20 plans from participating centers, including 12 from the benchmark case, 5 from a clinical pilot and 3 from the first study patients, were compared to automatically generated VMAT plans. RESULTS: For the submitted liver contours, Dice Similarity Coefficients (DSC) with the reference delineation ranged from 0.925 to 0.954. For the GTV, the DSC varied between 0.721 and 0.876. For the 12 plans on the benchmark case, healthy liver normal-tissue complication probabilities (NTCPs) ranged from 0.2% to 22.2% with little correlation between NCTP and PTV-D95% (R(2) < 0.3). Four protocol deviations were detected in the set of 20 treatment plans. Comparison with co-planar autoVMAT QA plans revealed these were due to too high target dose and suboptimal planning. Overall, autoVMAT resulted in an average liver NTCP reduction of 2.2 percent point (range: 16.2 percent point to -1.8 percent point, p = 0.03), and lower doses to the healthy liver (p < 0.01) and gastrointestinal organs at risk (p < 0.001).

256,Traditional herbal medicine prevents postoperative recurrence of small hepatocellular carcinoma: A randomized controlled study.,10.1002/cncr.30915,"BACKGROUND: To explore the clinical efficacy of traditional herbal medicine (THM) in the prevention of disease recurrence of small hepatocellular carcinoma after surgery, a prospective randomized controlled study was conducted between October 2006 and May 2010. The results indicated that THM prevented the recurrence of SHCC with an efficacy that was superior to that of transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) during a median follow-up of 26.61 months. METHODS: The patients were followed up every 6 months, and the clinical data before October 20, 2015 were analyzed. The primary outcome measure was recurrence-free survival (RFS), and the secondary outcome measure was overall survival (OS). RESULTS: The 364 patients included 180 in the THM group and 184 in the TACE group. At the time of the data cutoff of October 20, 2015, a total of 205 patients demonstrated disease recurrence, including 85 patients in the THM group and 120 patients in the TACE group. The median RFS of the THM and TACE groups demonstrated a statistically significant difference (P<.001). Until October 20, 2105, there were 91 deaths, including 34 in the THM group and 57 in the TACE group. The median OS demonstrated a significant difference between the 2 groups (P = .008). Multivariate analysis indicated that THM was an independent factor influencing RFS and OS. CONCLUSIONS: The efficacy of THM was found to be superior to that of TACE in preventing disease recurrence in patients with small hepatocellular carcinoma and prolonging OS.

Ramucirumab is a recombinant IgG1 monoclonal antibody and VEGF receptor-2 antagonist. We aimed to assess the safety and efficacy of ramucirumab in advanced hepatocellular carcinoma following first-line therapy with sorafenib. METHODS: In this randomised, placebo-controlled, double-blind, multicentre, phase 3 trial (REACH), patients were enrolled from 154 centres in 27 countries. Eligible patients were aged 18 years or older, had hepatocellular carcinoma with Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer stage C disease or stage B disease that was refractory or not amenable to locoregional therapy, had Child-Pugh A liver disease, an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0 or 1, had previously received sorafenib (stopped because of progression or intolerance), and had adequate haematological and biochemical parameters. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive intravenous ramucirumab (8 mg/kg) or placebo every 2 weeks, plus best supportive care, until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or death. Randomisation was stratified by geographic region and cause of liver disease with a stratified permuted block method. Patients, medical staff, investigators, and the funder were masked to treatment assignment. The primary endpoint was overall survival in the intention-to-treat population. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01140347. FINDINGS: Between Nov 4, 2010, and April 18, 2013, 565 patients were enrolled, of whom 283 were assigned to ramucirumab and 282 were assigned to placebo. Median overall survival for the ramucirumab group was 9·2 months (95% CI 8·0-10·6) versus 7·6 months (6·0-9·3) for the placebo group (HR 0·87 [95% CI 0·72-1·05]; p=0·14). Grade 3 or greater adverse events occurring in 5% or more of patients in either treatment group were ascites (13 [5%] of 277 patients treated with ramucirumab vs 11 [4%] of 276 patients treated with placebo), hypertension (34 [12%] vs ten [4%]), asthenia (14 [5%] vs five [2%]), malignant neoplasm progression (18 [6%] vs 11 [4%]), increased aspartate aminotransferase concentration (15 [5%] vs 23 [8%]), thrombocytopenia (13 [5%] vs one [<1%]), hyperbilirubinaemia (three [1%] vs 13 [5%]), and increased blood bilirubin (five [2%] vs 14 [5%]). The most frequently reported (≥1%) treatment-emergent serious adverse event of any grade or grade 3 or more was malignant neoplasm progression. INTERPRETATION: Second-line treatment with ramucirumab did not significantly improve survival over placebo in patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma. No new safety signals were noted in eligible patients and the safety profile is manageable.

258,Randomized controlled trial of the prophylactic effect of urea-based cream on sorafenib-associated hand-foot skin reactions in patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma.,10.1200/JCO.2013.52.9651,"PURPOSE: To assess whether urea-based cream (UBC) has prophylactic benefits on sorafenib-induced hand-foot skin reaction (HFSR) in patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). PATIENTS AND METHODS: In this randomized, open-label trial, 871 patients with advanced HCC throughout China were treated with 10% UBC three times per day plus best supportive care (BSC; n = 439) or BSC alone excluding all creams (n = 432), starting on day 1 of sorafenib treatment, for up to 12 weeks. HFSR was assessed every 2 weeks and at 14 weeks for patients completing the study. Once HFSR occurred, patients were allowed any cream, including a UBC. RESULTS: The 12-week incidence of any grade HFSR was significantly lower in the UBC group versus the BSC-alone group (56.0% v 73.6%, respectively; odds ratio [OR], 0.457; 95% CI, 0.344 to 0.608; P < .001), as was the incidence of grade ≥ 2 HFSR (20.7% v 29.2%, respectively; OR, 0.635; 95% CI, 0.466 to 0.866; P = .004). Median time to first occurrence of HFSR was significantly longer in the UBC group than the BSC-alone group (84 v 34 days, respectively; hazard ratio, 0.658; 95% CI, 0.541 to 0.799; P < .001). Elevated AST was associated with increased risk of HFSR but did not alter the treatment effect of UBC. UBC plus BSC, compared with BSC alone, did not affect the sorafenib dose reduction or interruption rate (9.1% v 11.8%, respectively; P = .1937), response rate (11.1% v 10.1%, respectively; P = .6674), or disease control rate (98.8% v 98.2%, respectively; P = .5350) at week 12. CONCLUSION: UBC prophylaxis in patients with advanced HCC starting sorafenib reduced HFSR rates, extended the time to first occurrence of HFSR, and improved patient quality of life compared with BSC.

259,Radioembolisation with yttrium‒90 microspheres versus sorafenib for treatment of advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (SARAH): study protocol for a randomised controlled trial.,10.1186/1745-6215-15-474,"BACKGROUND: Untreated advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is linked to poor prognosis. While sorafenib is the current recommended treatment for advanced HCC, radioembolisation (RE; also called selective internal radiation therapy or SIRT) with yttrium-90 microspheres has shown efficacy in cohort studies. However, there are no head-to-head trials comparing radiation therapy with yttrium-90 microspheres and sorafenib in advanced HCC. The SARAH trial has been designed to compare the efficacy and safety of sorafenib therapy and RE using yttrium-90 resin microspheres (SIR-Spheres™; Sirtex Medical Limited, North Sydney, Australia) in patients with advanced HCC. Quality of life (QoL) and cost-effectiveness will also be compared between therapies. METHODS/DESIGN: SARAH is a prospective, randomised, controlled, open-label, multicentre trial comparing the efficacy of RE with sorafenib in the treatment of patients with advanced HCC. The trial aims to recruit adults with a life expectancy of >3 months, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status ≤ 1, and: advanced HCC according to the Barcelona criteria (stage C) or recurrent HCC after surgical or thermoablative treatment who are not eligible for surgical resection, liver transplantation or thermal ablation; or two rounds of failed chemoembolisation. Patients will be randomised 1:1 to receive either RE or sorafenib 400 mg twice daily. All patients will be monitored for between 12 and 48 months following start of treatment. The primary endpoint of the SARAH trial is overall survival (OS). Secondary endpoints include: adverse events, progression-free survival at 6 months; tumour response rate; general or liver disease-specific QoL scores; and cost of each treatment strategy. Assuming an increase in median OS of 4 months with RE versus sorafenib therapy, randomising at least 400 patients (200 in each treatment arm) will be sufficient for 80% power and a bilateral alpha risk of 5%; therefore, 440 patients will be enrolled to allow for 10% loss of patients due to ineligibility. DISCUSSION: The SARAH trial is the first randomised head-to-head study to compare RE with sorafenib in advanced HCC, and will establish the potential role of RE in HCC treatment guidelines.

260,Randomised controlled trial of doxorubicin-eluting beads vs conventional chemoembolisation for hepatocellular carcinoma.,10.1038/bjc.2014.199,"BACKGROUND: Transcatheter arterial chemoembolisation (TACE) is the treatment of choice for intermediate stage hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Doxorubicin-loaded drug-eluting beads (DEB)-TACE is expected to improve the performance of conventional TACE (cTACE). The aim of this study was to compare DEB-TACE with cTACE in terms of time-to-tumour progression (TTP), adverse events (AEs), and 2-year survival. METHODS: Patients were randomised one-to-one to undergo cTACE or DEB-TACE and followed-up for at least 2 years or until death. Transcatheter arterial chemoembolisation was repeated 'on-demand'. RESULTS: We enrolled 177 patients: 89 underwent DEB-TACE and 88 cTACE. The median number of procedures was 2 in each arm, and the in-hospital stay was 3 and 4 days, respectively (P=0.323). No differences were found in local and overall tumour response. The median TTP was 9 months in both arms. The AE incidence and severity did not differ between the arms, except for post-procedural pain, more frequent and severe after cTACE (P<0.001). The 1- and 2-year survival rates were 86.2% and 56.8% after DEB-TACE and 83.5% and 55.4% after cTACE (P=0.949).

261,Drug effect analysis of sorafenib combined with transcatheter arterial chemoembolization in the treatment of advanced hepatocellular carcinoma.,,"Sorafenib is a new multi-target oral drug that inhibits many kinds of protein kinase small molecules to treat tumors. Currently, sorafenib is one of the drugs that permit systemic treatment of liver cancer in the middle stage. Although sorafenib has good therapeutic effect on liver cancer, the clinical effect of sorafenib alone in the treatment of liver cancer is limited. This study compared the efficacy of sorafenib, TACE (transcatheter arterial chemoembolization), and sorafenib combined with TACE in the treatment of liver cancer patients. The results showed that the curative effect of sorafenib combined with transcatheter arterial chemoembolization is better than that of hepatic artery chemoembolization or sorafenib orally. The total effective rate of combined treatment is 93.8%, while the effective rate of arterial chemoembolization and sorafenib is 64.1% and 72.2% respectively.

KEYNOTE-240 (NCT02702401) assessed the efficacy and safety of pembrolizumab plus best supportive care (BSC) versus placebo plus BSC in patients with HCC who previously received sorafenib. This study presents the results of a prespecified exploratory analysis of patient-reported outcomes. METHODS: Patients completed the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Core Quality of Life Questionnaire (EORTC QLQ-C30) and its HCC supplement (EORTC QLQ-HCC18) electronically at baseline; at weeks 2, 3, 4, 6, 9, 12, and 18; and then every 9 weeks until 1 year or end of treatment, and at the 30-day safety follow-up visit. RESULTS: The HRQoL population included 271 and 127 patients randomly assigned to pembrolizumab and placebo, respectively. From baseline to week 12, changes in both scores were similar between pembrolizumab and placebo; global health status/QoL scores were stable. The proportions of patients who improved, remained stable, or deteriorated across all functional domain and symptom scores were generally similar between pembrolizumab and placebo. Time to deterioration was similar between the 2 arms based on the prespecified analysis of EORTC QLQ-HCC18 domains of abdominal swelling, fatigue, and pain.

In the phase III DECISION trial in patients with DTC, sorafenib exposure and the incidence of some adverse events (AEs) were higher than in previous trials; therefore, we analyzed exposure-response relationships, including progression-free survival (PFS) and selected AEs in patients with DTC. A novel, stratified prediction-corrected visual predictive check (pc-VPC) was developed to show robustness of the exposure-response relationships. Time-to-event simulations confirmed the benefit of the recommended dosing schedule of 800 mg/day: initial doses of 800 mg/day were associated with the highest PFS, whereas lower doses (600 or 400 mg/day) were associated with improved tolerability but reduced PFS. A simulated dose-reduction strategy of 800 mg/day for an initial two cycles followed by dose reductions seemed likely to maintain efficacy while possibly mitigating selected AEs (e.g., diarrhea and hand-foot skin reactions).

264,Population pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic modeling of serum biomarkers as predictors of tumor dynamics following lenvatinib treatment in patients with radioiodine-refractory differentiated thyroid cancer (RR-DTC).,10.1002/psp4.13130,"Lenvatinib is a receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) inhibitor targeting vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) receptors 1-3, fibroblast growth factor (FGF) receptors 1-4, platelet-derived growth factor receptor-α (PDGFRα), KIT, and RET that have been implicated in pathogenic angiogenesis, tumor growth, and cancer. The primary objective of this work was to evaluate, by establishing quantitative relationships, whether lenvatinib exposure and longitudinal serum biomarker data (VEGF, Ang-2, Tie-2, and FGF-23) are predictors for change in longitudinal tumor size which was assessed based on data from 558 patients with radioiodine-refractory differentiated thyroid cancer (RR-DTC) receiving either lenvatinib or placebo treatment. Lenvatinib PK was best described by a 3-compartment model with simultaneous first- and zero-order absorption and linear elimination from the central compartment with significant covariates (body weight, albumin <30 g/dL, ALP>ULN, RR-DTC, RCC, HCC subjects, and concomitant CYP3A inhibitors). Except for body weight, none of the covariates have any clinically meaningful effect on exposure to lenvatinib. Longitudinal biomarker measurements over time were reasonably well defined by a PK/PD model with common EC(50), E(max), and a slope for disease progression for all biomarkers. Longitudinal tumor measurements over time were reasonably well defined by a tumor growth inhibition E(max) model, which in addition to lenvatinib exposure, included model-predicted relative changes from baseline over time for Tie-2 and Ang-2 as having significant association with tumor response.

Accordingly, this phase 3 study was conducted to evaluate the efficacy of tivantinib as a second-line treatment for Japanese patients with MET-high hepatocellular carcinoma. This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study was conducted at 60 centers in Japan. Hepatocellular carcinoma patients with one prior sorafenib treatment and those with MET-high tumor samples were eligible for inclusion. Registered patients were randomly assigned to either the tivantinib or placebo group at a 2:1 ratio and were treated with twice-a-day oral tivantinib (120 mg bid) or placebo until the discontinuation criteria were met.

This exploratory analysis describes outcomes of sequential treatment with sorafenib followed by regorafenib. METHODS: In RESORCE, 573 patients were randomized 2:1 to regorafenib 160 mg/day or placebo for 3 weeks on/1 week off. Efficacy and safety were evaluated by last sorafenib dose. The time from the start of sorafenib to death was assessed. Time to progression (TTP) in RESORCE was analyzed by TTP during prior sorafenib treatment. RESULTS: HRs (regorafenib/placebo) for OS by last sorafenib dose were similar (0.67 for 800 mg/day; 0.68 for <800 mg/day). Rates of grade 3, 4, and 5 adverse events with regorafenib by last sorafenib dose (800 mg/day vs. <800 mg/day) were 52%, 11%, and 15% vs. 60%, 10%, and 12%, respectively. Median times (95% CI) from the start of sorafenib to death were 26.0 months (22.6-28.1) for regorafenib and 19.2 months (16.3-22.8) for placebo. Median time from the start of sorafenib to progression on sorafenib was 7.2 months for the regorafenib arm and 7.1 months for the placebo arm. An analysis of TTP in RESORCE in subgroups defined by TTP during prior sorafenib in quartiles (Q) showed HRs (regorafenib/placebo; 95% CI) of 0.66 (0.45-0.96; Q1); 0.26 (0.17-0.40; Q2); 0.40 (0.27-0.60; Q3); and 0.54 (0.36-0.81; Q4).

We did a pilot clinical investigation, including a nonrandomized (57 patients with large HCC) and a randomized controlled (20 patients with large HCC) study. METHODS: The patients were treated with transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) with or without bicarbonate local infusion into tumor. RESULTS: In the nonrandomized controlled study, geometric mean of viable tumor residues (VTR) in TACE with bicarbonate was 6.4-fold lower than that in TACE without bicarbonate (7.1% [95% CI: 4.6%–10.9%] vs 45.6% [28.9%–72.0%]; p<0.0001). This difference was recapitulated by a subsequent randomized controlled study. TACE combined with bicarbonate yielded a 100% objective response rate (ORR), whereas the ORR treated with TACE alone was 44.4% (nonrandomized) and 63.6% (randomized).

This study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of a clinical decision support system in postembolization syndrome management across nurses and patient outcomes. This study is a randomized controlled trial. We included 40 RNs and 51 hospitalized patients in the study. For nurses in the experimental group, a clinical decision support system and a handbook were provided for 6 weeks, and for nurses in the control group, only a handbook was provided. Notably, the experimental group exhibited statistically significant improvements in patient-centered caring attitude, pain management barrier identification, and comfort care competence after clinical decision support system implementation. Moreover, patients' symptom interference during the experimental period significantly decreased compared with before the intervention. This study offers insights into the potential of clinical decision support system in refining nursing practices and nurturing patient well-being, presenting prospects for advancing patient-centered care and nursing competence.

269,Angiogenic Response following Radioembolization: Results from a Randomized Pilot Study of Yttrium-90 with or without Sorafenib.,10.1016/j.jvir.2016.03.043,"PURPOSE: To compare the regulation of serum angiogenic factors in patients with unresectable early hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) treated with yttrium-90 ((90)Y) radioembolization alone vs with sorafenib. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In a single-center pilot study, 23 patients with unresectable HCC awaiting orthotopic liver transplantation were prospectively randomized to receive radioembolization alone (n = 12) or radioembolization with sorafenib (n = 11). Serum angiogenic markers (angiopoietin-2 [Ang-2], hepatocyte growth factor, interleukin [IL]-6, IL-8, c-reactive protein, platelet-derived growth factor [PDGF], and vascular endothelial growth factor [VEGF]) were assayed at baseline and at 2 and 4 weeks after radioembolization ((90)Y alone, n = 6; (90)Y plus sorafenib, n = 7). RESULTS: In the (90)Y-alone group, all growth factors were elevated above baseline levels at 2 and 4 weeks: VEGF increased 36% vs baseline at 2 weeks and 22% at 4 weeks, and PDGF increased 24% at 2 weeks and 3% at 4 weeks. In the (90)Y/sorafenib arm, Ang-2 and PDGF decreased at 2 weeks and the remainder increased. By 4 weeks, only PDGF remained below baseline levels. VEGF increased 49% at 2 weeks and 28% at 4 weeks, and PDGF decreased 31% at 2 weeks and 39% at 4 weeks. Differences were statistically significant for hepatocyte growth factor (P = .03) and PDGF (P = .02) at 2 weeks and for IL-6 (P = .05) at 4 weeks. CONCLUSIONS: Radioembolization is associated with a mild increase in angiogenic markers. The addition of sorafenib blunts PDGF response; other factors such as VEGF remain unaffected.

270,Objective response by mRECIST as a predictor and potential surrogate end-point of overall survival in advanced HCC.,10.1016/j.jhep.2017.01.012,"BACKGROUND & AIMS: The Modified Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (mRECIST) was developed to overcome the limitations of standard RECIST criteria in response assessment of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). We aimed to investigate whether objective response by mRECIST accurately predicted overall survival (OS) in patients with advanced HCC treated with systemic targeted therapies and also to preliminarily assess this end-point as a potential surrogate of OS. METHODS: Individual patient data from the BRISK-PS randomized phase III trial comparing brivanib vs. placebo (the first to prospectively incorporate mRECIST) were used to analyze objective response as a predictor of OS in a time-dependent covariate analysis. Patients with available imaging scans during follow-up were included (n=334; 85% of those randomized). Moreover, a correlation of the survival probability in deciles vs. the observed objective response was performed to evaluate its suitability as a surrogate end-point. RESULTS: Objective response was observed in 11.5% and 1.9% of patients treated with brivanib and placebo respectively, and was associated with a better survival (median OS 15.0 vs. 9.4months, p<0.001). In addition, objective response had an independent prognostic value (HR=0.48; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.26-0.91, p=0.025) along with known prognostic factors. Finally, objective response showed promising results as a surrogate of OS in this trial (R=-0.92; 95% CI, -1 to -0.73, p<0.001). It was an early indicator of the treatment effect (median time to objective response was 1.4months). CONCLUSIONS: Objective response by mRECIST in advanced HCC predicts OS and thus can be considered as a candidate surrogate end-point. Further studies are needed to support this finding. LAY SUMMARY: There is a need to identify surrogate end-points for overall survival in advanced hepatocellular carcinoma. We studied patients from the phase III BRISK trial, comparing brivanib treatment with placebo after sorafenib progression. We demonstrate that objective response is an independent predictor of survival and qualifies as a potential surrogate end-point for overall survival in this patient population.

METHODS: To determine whether the simpler urine protein:creatinine ratio (UPCR) calculated from spot urine samples could be accurately used for proteinuria monitoring in patients receiving lenvatinib, we evaluated the correlation between UPCR and 24-hour urine protein results from the phase 3 REFLECT study. Paired data (323 tests, 154 patients) were analysed. RESULTS: Regression analysis showed a statistically significant correlation between UPCR and 24-hour urine protein (R(2): 0.75; P < 2 × 10(-16)). A UPCR cut-off value of 2.4 had 96.9% sensitivity, 82.5% specificity for delineating between grade 2 and 3 proteinuria. Using this UPCR cut-off value to determine the need for further testing could reduce the need for 24-hour urine collection in ~74% of patients.

273,Phase III randomized study of second line ADI-PEG 20 plus best supportive care versus placebo plus best supportive care in patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma.,10.1093/annonc/mdy101,"BACKGROUND: Arginine depletion is a putative target in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). HCC often lacks argininosuccinate synthetase, a citrulline to arginine-repleting enzyme. ADI-PEG 20 is a cloned arginine degrading enzyme-arginine deiminase-conjugated with polyethylene glycol. The goal of this study was to evaluate this agent as a potential novel therapeutic for HCC after first line systemic therapy. METHODS AND PATIENTS: Patients with histologically proven advanced HCC and Child-Pugh up to B7 with prior systemic therapy, were randomized 2 : 1 to ADI-PEG 20 18 mg/m2 versus placebo intramuscular injection weekly. The primary end point was overall survival (OS), with 93% power to detect a 4-5.6 months increase in median OS (one-sided α = 0.025). Secondary end points included progression-free survival, safety, and arginine correlatives. RESULTS: A total of 635 patients were enrolled: median age 61, 82% male, 60% Asian, 52% hepatitis B, 26% hepatitis C, 76% stage IV, 91% Child-Pugh A, 70% progressed on sorafenib and 16% were intolerant. Median OS was 7.8 months for ADI-PEG 20 versus 7.4 for placebo (P = 0.88, HR = 1.02) and median progression-free survival 2.6 months versus 2.6 (P = 0.07, HR = 1.17). Grade 3 fatigue and decreased appetite occurred in <5% of patients. Two patients on ADI-PEG 20 had ≥grade 3 anaphylactic reaction. Death rate within 30 days of end of treatment was 15.2% on ADI-PEG 20 versus 10.4% on placebo, none related to therapy. Post hoc analyses of arginine assessment at 4, 8, 12 and 16 weeks, demonstrated a trend of improved OS for those with more prolonged arginine depletion. CONCLUSION: ADI-PEG 20 monotherapy did not demonstrate an OS benefit in second line setting for HCC. It was well tolerated.

This study aimed to investigate the clinical effects of transcutaneous electrical acupoint stimulation (TEAS) on nausea and vomiting after TACE. METHODS: A total of 142 patients who received TACE with cisplatin for primary or metastatic liver cancer were assigned to the active-acupuncture (n = 72) or placebo-acupuncture (n = 70) groups using a covariate-adaptive randomization at a ratio of 1:1. The acupoints Hegu (LI4), Neiguan (P6), and Zusanli (ST36) were stimulated twice daily for 6 days. The effects of TEAS on nausea and vomiting were assessed by using occurrence rate and severity of these symptoms. Anorexia scale and M. D. Anderson Symptom Inventory (MDASI) scores were secondary endpoints and were used to assess the effect of TEAS on patient appetite and quality of life. The safety of the treatments was also monitored. RESULTS: Between the two groups, the differences in occurrence rates and severities of nausea and vomiting after TACE were not significant (all P > 0.05). From the second day after TACE, anorexia scores were significantly lower in the active-acupuncture group than in the placebo-acupuncture group and continued to decrease over time with treatment (all P values less than 0.01).

In the intent-to-treat population (n = 565), a significant improvement in overall survival (OS) was not observed. In patients with an elevated baseline α-fetoprotein (AFP) level (400 ng/mL or greater), an improvement in OS was demonstrated. An analysis of the Japanese patients in REACH was performed. METHODS: An analysis was performed with the subset of the intent-to-treat population enrolled in Japan (n = 93). RESULTS: The median OS was 12.9 months for the ramucirumab arm (n = 45) and 8.0 months for the placebo arm (n = 48) [hazard ratio (HR) 0.621 (95 % confidence interval (CI) 0.391-0.986); P = 0.0416]. The median progression-free survival was 4.1 months for the ramucirumab arm and 1.7 months for the placebo arm [HR 0.449 (95 % CI 0.285-0.706); P = 0.0004]. The objective response rates were 11 % for the ramucirumab arm and 2 % for the placebo arm (P = 0.0817). The grade 3 or higher treatment-emergent adverse events occurring in more than 5 % of patients with a higher incidence for the ramucirumab arm (n = 44) than for the placebo arm (n = 47) were ascites (7% vs 2 %), hypertension (7 % vs 2 %), and cholangitis (7 % vs 0 %).

Thus, we detected the prognostic value of preoperative NLR in the single-nodule small HCC (SHCC) patients using X-tile for cutpoint. METHODS: Between January 2007 and December 2010, a total of 222 single-nodule SHCC patients underwent curative resection and were examined for the prognostic roles of preoperative NLR by X-tile. RESULTS: In this study, all patients were divided into the low-NLR subgroup (NLR ≤ 2.1) and the high-NLR subgroup (NLR > 2.1) by X-tile. Preoperative NLR showed predictive value for time to recurrence (TTR) and overall survival (OS). Moreover, NLR was associated with total bilirubin, white blood cell counts, and HBsAg, respectively (P = 0.012, <0.001, and 0.011, respectively). Especially, NLR could discriminate the outcome of patients in the subgroup with alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) levels of ≤400 ng/mL. Importantly, postoperative transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (TACE) had close relationship with OS (P = 0.001) and TTR (P ≤ 0.001).

The incidence of grade 2/3 HFSR was also lower in ozone oil group than in urea ointment group (15.9% [7/44] vs 27.7 [13/47]).
