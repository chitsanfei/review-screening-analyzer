0,0,0,The molecular mechanisms between metabolic syndrome and breast cancer,"Chen, Y; Wen, YY; Li, ZR; Luo, DL; Zhang, XH",10.1016/j.bbrc.2016.02.034,"Metabolic syndrome, which is extremely common in developed and some developing countries, is a clustering of at least three of five of the following medical conditions: abdominal obesity, elevated blood pressure, elevated fasting plasma glucose, high serum triglycerides, and low high-density lipoprotein levels. It has been proved that there is a strong association between metabolic syndrome and breast cancer. Metabolic syndrome could increase the risk of breast cancer and influence the prognosis of the breast cancer patients. Some characteristic of metabolic syndrome such as obesity and lack of physical exercise are all risk factors for developing breast cancer. The metabolic syndrome mainly include obesity, type 2 diabetes, hypercholesterolemia and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, and each of them impacts the risk of breast cancer and the prognosis of the breast cancer patients in different ways. In this Review, we focus on recently uncovered aspects of the immunological and molecular mechanisms that are responsible for the development of this highly prevalent and serious disease. These studies bring new insight into the complex associations between metabolic syndrome and breast cancer and have led to the development of novel therapeutic strategies that might enable a personalized approach in the management of this disease.

2,1,1,Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease promotes breast cancer progression through upregulated hepatic fibroblast growth factor 21,"Sui, Y; Liu, QQ; Xu, C; Ganesan, K; Ye, Z; Li, Y; Wu, JM; Du, B; Gao, F; Song, CL; Chen, JP",10.1038/s41419-023-06386-8,"Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) has been shown to influence breast cancer progression, but the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. In this study, we investigated the impact of NAFLD on breast cancer tumor growth and cell viability through the potential mediator, hepatic fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21). Both peritumoral and systemic administration of FGF21 promoted breast cancer tumor growth, while FGF21 knockout attenuated the tumor-promoting effects of the high-fat diet. Mechanistically, exogenous FGF21 treatment enhanced the anti-apoptotic ability of breast cancer cells through STAT3 and Akt/FoXO1 signaling pathways, and mitigated doxorubicin-induced cell death. Furthermore, we observed overexpression of FGF21 in tumor tissues from breast cancer patients, which was associated with poor prognosis. These findings suggest a novel role for FGF21 as an upregulated mediator in the context of NAFLD, promoting breast cancer development and highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target for cancer treatment."

Patients with breast cancer were enrolled in the study from January 2007 to June 2017. Hepatic steatosis was evaluated through non-enhanced computed tomography scan by measuring Hounsfield Units in the liver and spleen, respectively; 123 healthy controls who underwent non-enhanced computed tomography scan were also analyzed. The prevalence of NAFLD in patients with breast cancer was 15.8% (251/1587), which was significantly higher than in healthy controls (8.9%, 11/123) (P=.036). Overall survival did not significantly differ between the groups with and without NAFLD (P=.304). However, recurrence-free survival was significantly higher in patients without NAFLD than in those with NAFLD (P=.009). Among breast cancer patients receiving endocrine treatment, the NAFLD group showed a higher cumulative incidence of significant liver injury than the group without NAFLD (P<.001). The prevalence of NAFLD in patients with breast cancer is significantly higher than in healthy controls. Moreover, breast cancer patients with NAFLD showed poorer prognosis in terms of recurrence. Therefore, diagnostic evaluation for NALFD is important in managing patients with breast cancer."

9,4,4,Tamoxifen induces fatty liver disease in breast cancer through the MAPK8/FoxO pathway,"Gong, LY; Tang, HM; Luo, ZZ; Sun, X; Tan, XY; Xie, LN; Lei, YTT; Cai, MJ; He, CC; Ma, JL; Han, SX",10.1002/ctm2.5,"Background Prevention of metabolic complications of long-term adjuvant endocrine therapy in breast cancers remained a challenge. We aimed to investigate the molecular mechanism in the development of tamoxifen (TAM)-induced fatty liver in both estrogen receptor (ER)-positive and ER-negative breast cancer. Methods and results First, the direct protein targets (DPTs) of TAM were identified using DrugBank5.1.7. We found that mitogen-activated protein kinase 8 (MAPK8) was one DPT of TAM. We identified significant genes in breast cancer and fatty liver disease (FLD) using the MalaCards human disease database. Next, we analyzed the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathways of those significant genes in breast cancer and FLD using the Search Tool for the Retrieval of Interacting Genes/Proteins (STRING). We found that overlapping KEGG pathways in these two diseases were MAPK signaling pathway, Forkhead box O (FoxO) signaling pathway, HIF-1 signaling pathway, AGE-RAGE signaling pathway in diabetic complications, and PI3K-Akt signaling pathway. Furthermore, the KEGG Mapper showed that the MAPK signaling pathway was related to the FoxO signaling pathway. Finally, the functional relevance of breast cancer and TAM-induced FLD was validated by Western blot analysis. We verified that TAM may induce fatty liver in breast cancer through the MAPK8/FoxO signaling pathway. Conclusion Bioinformatics analysis combined with conventional experiments may improve our understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying side effects of cancer drugs, thereby making this method a new paradigm for guiding future studies on this issue."

Objectives: To assess the relationship between NAFLD and newly diagnosed cases of breast cancer. Methods: The results of mammography screening examinations in women referred to the Breast Center, Holy Family Hospital, Nazareth during a 4 year period were collected. We identified cases of women who were newly diagnosed with breast cancer and who underwent abdominal computed tomography (CT) within 1 month of the diagnosis. The control group comprised women with normal mammography and breast ultrasonography who underwent abdominal CT within 3 months from the date of the breast cancer screening during the same study period. The control cases were matched by age and body mass index (BMI). We compared the cases with the controls in terms of the presence of diffuse hepatic fatty liver and other known risk factors for breast cancer. Results: Of the 133 women with new diagnosis of cancer, 73 were eligible for the study. NAFLD was found in 33 of the women with breast cancer and in 12 in the control group (45.2% vs.16.4%, respectively, P = 0.002).

In this study, a total of 961 patients with breast cancer and 1,006 non-cancer patients were recruited. The clinical characteristics were collected and analyzed using logistic analysis. Risk factors were assessed by a risk rating system. Univariate analysis showed that body mass index, triglyceride, total cholesterol, NAFLD, NAFPD, low-density lipoprotein, and uric acid (UA) were significantly related to breast cancer. Among them, NAFLD, NAFPD, and UA were independent risk factors related to breast cancer identified by multivariate analysis. The risk assessment model was established based on these factors and demonstrated that the odds ratio sharply increased with the rising scores. Compared with the low-risk group, the odds ratio in the intermediate- and high-risk groups were 1.662 (1.380-2.001) and 3.185 (2.145-4.728), respectively. In conclusion, the risk-stratification scoring system combining NAFLD, NAFPD, and UA can accurately predict the occurrence of breast cancer."

The disease-specific molecular events, which may induce susceptibility to Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection, are being investigated. To assess this, we retrieved array-based gene expression datasets from patients of 30 frequently occurring acute, chronic, or infectious diseases. Comparative analyses of the datasets were performed after quantile normalization and log2 transformation. Among the 78 host genes prominently implicated in COVID-19 infection, ACE2 (receptor for SARS-CoV-2) was positively regulated in several cases, namely, leukemia, psoriasis, lung cancer, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), breast cancer, and pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH). FURIN was positively regulated in some cases, such as leukemia, psoriasis, NAFLD, lung cancer, and type II diabetes (T2D), while TMPRSS2 was positively regulated in only 3 cases, namely, leukemia, lung cancer, and T2D. Genes encoding various interferons, cytokines, chemokines, and mediators of JAK-STAT pathway were positively regulated in leukemia, NAFLD, and T2D cases. Among the 161 genes that are positively regulated in the lungs of COVID-19 patients, 99-111 genes in leukemia (including various studied subtypes), 77 genes in NAFLD, and 48 genes in psoriasis were also positively regulated. Because of the high similarity in gene expression patterns, the patients of leukemia, NAFLD, T2D, psoriasis, and PAH may need additional preventive care against acquiring SARS-CoV-2 infections.

Methods: This study examined the risk of lung cancer in the general population in conjunction with the incidence of steatotic liver disease. The study population consisted of 3,261,438 individuals aged 20 years or older who underwent a general health examination in 2009. Results: Individuals with fatty liver index (FLI) of 30-59 exhibited a 1.08-fold increased risk of lung cancer (95% CI: 1.04-1.11), while FLI >= 60 was associated with a 1.22-fold elevated risk of lung cancer (95% CI: 1.17-1.28) compared to those with FLI < 30. The risk varied with smoking status; in current smokers, the adjusted HR for the FLI 30-59 group was 1.05 (95% CI: 1.00-1.10), while that in the FLI >= 60 group was 1.11 (95% CI: 1.04-1.18).

LPCAT 1-4 have different roles in metabolic diseases, such as diabetes, hyperlipidemia, hyperglycemia, and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis. Furthermore, LPCAT1 has been an independent predictor of early tumor recurrence and represents a novel prognostic biomarker for hepatocellular carcinoma, gastric cancer, breast cancer, oral squamous cell carcinoma, prostate cancer, colorectal cancer, and clear cell renal cell carcinoma. LPCAT2 is recognized as a novel aggressive prostate cancer susceptibility gene, and LPCAT4 participates in the elevated expression of PC (16:0/16:1) in colorectal cancer. LPCATs will provide a foundation for potential novel therapeutic approaches and highlight the important role of phospholipid metabolism in the prevention and treatment of metabolic diseases and cancers."

LPCAT 1-4 have different roles in metabolic diseases, such as diabetes, hyperlipidemia, hyperglycemia, and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis. Furthermore, LPCAT1 has been an independent predictor of early tumor recurrence and represents a novel prognostic biomarker for hepatocellular carcinoma, gastric cancer, breast cancer, oral squamous cell carcinoma, prostate cancer, colorectal cancer, and clear cell renal cell carcinoma. LPCAT2 is recognized as a novel aggressive prostate cancer susceptibility gene, and LPCAT4 participates in the elevated expression of PC (16:0/16:1) in colorectal cancer. LPCATs will provide a foundation for potential novel therapeutic approaches and highlight the important role of phospholipid metabolism in the prevention and treatment of metabolic diseases and cancers."

Methods Patients who underwent resection for colorectal cancer between January 2015 and January 2021 were enrolled in this study. All patients were measured for body mass index (BMI) and visceral fat area (VFA) preoperatively. Infectious complications were compared between the different groups according to BMI and VO categories. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression were used to analyze whether VO was an independent risk factor for postoperative infectious complications. According to the results of logistic regression, six machine learning approaches were used to establish predictive models and perform internal validation. The best-performing model was interpreted by the SHAPley Additive exPlanations value. Results Approximately 64.81% of 520 patients had VO. VO was significantly connected with postoperative infectious complications (P < 0.001), coronary heart disease (P = 0.004), cerebral infarction (P = 0.001), hypertension (P < 0.001), diabetes (P < 0.001), and fatty liver (P < 0.001). The rates of wound infection (P = 0.048), abdominal or pelvic infection (P = 0.006), and pneumonia (P = 0.008) increased obviously in patients with VO. Compared to the low BMI group, a high BMI was found to be significantly associated with hypertension (P=0.007), fatty liver (P<0.001), and a higher rate of postoperative infection (P=0.003). The results of logistic regression revealed that VO (OR = 2.01, 95% CI 1.17 similar to 3.48, P = 0.012), operation time >= 4 h (OR = 2.52, 95% CI 1.60 similar to 3.97, P < 0.001), smoking (OR = 2.04, 95% CI 1.16 similar to 3.59, P = 0.014), ostomy (OR = 1.65, 95% CI 1.04 similar to 2.61, P = 0.033), and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) (OR = 2.23, 95% CI 1.09 similar to 4.57, P = 0.029) were independent risk factors. The light gradient boosting machine (LGBM) model displayed the largest area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) (0.74, 95% CI 0.68 similar to 0.81).

48,20,20,Association between tamoxifen treatment and the development of different stages of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease among breast cancer patients,"Pan, HJ; Chang, HT; Lee, CH",10.1016/j.jfma.2015.05.006,"Background/Purpose: For estrogen-receptor positive breast cancer cases, tamoxifen has been the most important adjuvant hormonal therapy for the purpose of reducing recurrence rates and prolonging disease free survival. However, several side effects have been noticed, and fatty liver is one of the most common side effects among them. Since fatty liver is a common problem in the general population, we wanted to examine the effects of tamoxifen under pre-existing fatty liver conditions and evaluate the prevalence of tamoxifen-related impaired liver function. Methods: We recruited breast cancer cases at ages 20-70 years and divided them into tamoxifen or control groups. Personal information was collected, and fasting blood tests and abdominal ultrasound were performed. The changes of fatty liver degree between the initial and follow-up ultrasound were divided into five categories. Results: Of the 406 enrolled participants, 266 were in the tamoxifen group and 140 were in the control group. The tamoxifen group had a higher risk of newly developed fatty liver [hazard ratio (HR) = 3.69; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.67-8.13), lower rate of improved fatty liver (HR = 0.33; 95% CI 0.15-0.75), and higher rate of worsened fatty liver (HR = 2.11; 95% CI 1.02-4.35). Conclusion: The current study suggests that tamoxifen treatment is associated with the risk of fatty liver either by increasing the risk of newly developed fatty liver conditions or worsening previous fatty liver conditions, and even retarding fatty liver improvement.

Previous studies had investigated the association between NAFLD and various extrahepatic cancers, but the available data to date is not conclusive. The aim of this study was to investigate the association between NAFLD and various extrahepatic cancers comprehensively. Methods Searches were conducted of various electronic databases (PubMed, EMBASE, Medline, and the Cochrane Library) to identify observational studies published between 1996 and January 2020 which investigated the association between NAFLD and extrahepatic cancers. The pooled OR/HR/IRR of the association between NAFLD and various extrahepatic cancers were analyzed. Results A total of 26 studies were included to investigate the association between NAFLD and various extrahepatic cancers. As the results shown, the pooled OR values of the risk of colorectal cancer and adenomas in patients with NAFLD were 1.72 (95%CI: 1.40-2.11) and 1.37 (95%CI: 1.29-1.46), respectively. The pooled OR values of the risk of intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma and extrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma in patients with NAFLD were 2.46 (95%CI: 1.77-3.44) and 2.24 (95%CI: 1.58-3.17), respectively. The pooled OR value of the risk of breast cancer in patients with NAFLD was 1.69 (95%CI: 1.44-1.99). In addition, NAFLD was also tightly associatied with the risk of gastric cancer, pancreatic cancer, prostate cancer, and esophageal cancer. Conclusions NAFLD could significantly increase the development risk of colorectal adenomas and cancer, intrahepatic and extrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma, breast, gastric, pancreatic, prostate, and esophageal cancer. NAFLD could be considered as one of the influencing factors during the clinical diagnosis and treatment for the extrahepatic cancers."

The pooled OR value of the risk of breast cancer in patients with NAFLD was 1.69 (95%CI: 1.44-1.99). In addition, NAFLD was also tightly associatied with the risk of gastric cancer, pancreatic cancer, prostate cancer, and esophageal cancer. CONCLUSIONS: NAFLD could significantly increase the development risk of colorectal adenomas and cancer, intrahepatic and extrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma, breast, gastric, pancreatic, prostate, and esophageal cancer. NAFLD could be considered as one of the influencing factors during the clinical diagnosis and treatment for the extrahepatic cancers."

Chemoprevention using natural, dietary, or synthetic products has emerged as a promising approach to address this growing burden. Atractylenolide-III (AT-III), a sesquiterpenoid present in various medicinal herbs, has demonstrated potential therapeutic effects against several diseases, including tumors, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, and cerebral ischemic injury. However, its impact on breast cancer chemoprevention remains unexplored. In this study, we used an N-methyl-N-nitrosourea (NMU)-induced rat breast cancer model and 17 beta-estradiol (E2)treated MCF-10A cells to evaluate the chemopreventive potential of AT-III on mammary tumorigenesis. AT-III inhibited mammary tumor progression, evidenced by reduced tumor volume and multiplicity, prolonged tumor latency, and the reversal of NMU-induced weight loss. Furthermore, AT-III suppressed NMU-induced inflammation and oxidative stress through the Nrf2/ARE pathway in breast cancer tissues. In vitro, AT-III effectively suppressed E2-induced anchorage-independent growth and cell migration in MCF-10A cells. Nrf2 knockdown attenuated the protective effects of AT-III, highlighting the pivotal role of Nrf2 in AT-III-mediated suppression of tumorigenesis. The mechanism involves the induction of Nrf2 expression by AT-III through the autophagic degradation of Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1 (Keap1). Overall, the results of this study indicate that AT-III is a promising candidate for breast cancer chemoprevention and provide valuable insights into its molecular interactions and signaling pathways."

However, the relationship between NAFLD and the prognosis of CRC remains unclear. The primary objective of this study was to evaluate the overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) rates in patients with CRC and the secondary objective was to compare clinicopathologic variables which were stratified by NAFLD. We performed a large cohort study of 1314 patients who were first diagnosed with CRC between January 2006 and April 2011. Postoperative follow-up data were collected from out-patient medical records, telephone consultations, and social security death indices. The Kaplan-Meier method was used to calculate the cumulative survival rate. Clinicopathologic variables were analyzed by univariate analysis and multivariate analysis through a Cox proportional hazard regression model. The mean follow-up time was 52.7 +/- 25.3 months. Upon baseline comparison, the NAFLD group had significantly higher values of body mass index, triglycerides, and uric acid and significantly lower values of high-density lipoprotein, compared with the non-NAFLD group (P < 0.05 for all). There were no significant differences between the 2 groups with regard to tumor location, TNM staging, tumor differentiation, carcinoembryonic antigen, and vascular invasion. The cumulative 1-, 3-, and 5-year OS rates were 96.1%, 85.2%, and 80.6%, respectively, in the NAFLD group, which were statistically significantly higher than the OS rates of 91.6%, 76.2%, and 67.8%, respectively, in the non-NAFLD group (P = 0.075, P = 0.002, P = 0.030, respectively). There was no difference in DFS rates between the CRC patients with and without NAFLD (P = 0.267).

We did not find any statistically significant differences in OS (P = 0.182) or DFS (P = 0.248) between the remission group and no remission group. Conclusions: The NAFLD remission rate reached 60.0% for CRC patients 1 year after radical surgery. In addition, we found that weight change was a predictor of NAFLD remission."

However, accordingly, the long-term use of TMX would lead to nonalcoholic fatty liver (NAFLD) in clinical, which had no definite treatment up to now. Fatostatin (Fato), an inhibitor of sterol-regulatory element binding protein 2 (SREBP2), was reported as a synergistic inhibitor of ER-positive breast cancer with TMX, but the hepatic lipid regulation of this combination is still unknown. Herein, we aimed to explore the effect and mechanism of Fato against TMX-induced NAFLD. The results identified that hepatic cholesterol content increase was the main reason for TMX-induced NAFLD. It was caused by the upregulation of circulating cholesterol uptake mediated by low density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) in liver, which resulted from the activation of SREBP2. Meanwhile, Fato could inhibit activation of SREBP2-LDLR pathway, alleviating TMX-induced hepatic cholesterol accumulation.

We discuss disease states and/or CVD risk factors related to smoking, such as dyslipidaemia, vascular inflammation, endothelial dysfunction, arterial stiffness, insulin resistance, type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), chronic kidney disease (CKD), and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) as well as their complex interrelations. Smoking cessation can correct abnormalities related to smoking; however, success rates are relatively low. In cases of inability to quit, measures to minimize the adverse effects of smoking specifically related to CVD should be taken. Smokers should receive best practice treatment, according to guidelines, as for non-smokers."
95,45,45,The Role of AKR1B10 in Physiology and Pathophysiology,"Endo, S; Matsunaga, T; Nishinaka, T",10.3390/metabo11060332,"AKR1B10 is a human nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH)-dependent reductase belonging to the aldo-keto reductase (AKR) 1B subfamily. It catalyzes the reduction of aldehydes, some ketones and quinones, and interacts with acetyl-CoA carboxylase and heat shock protein 90 alpha. The enzyme is highly expressed in epithelial cells of the stomach and intestine, but down-regulated in gastrointestinal cancers and inflammatory bowel diseases. In contrast, AKR1B10 expression is low in other tissues, where the enzyme is upregulated in cancers, as well as in non-alcoholic fatty liver disease and several skin diseases. In addition, the enzyme's expression is elevated in cancer cells resistant to clinical anti-cancer drugs. Thus, growing evidence supports AKR1B10 as a potential target for diagnosing and treating these diseases. Herein, we reviewed the literature on the roles of AKR1B10 in a healthy gastrointestinal tract, the development and progression of cancers and acquired chemoresistance, in addition to its gene regulation, functions, and inhibitors."

The role of comorbidities in this development is debated. The aim of this study was to investigate the significance of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) for the incidence of cancer of various kinds in Germany. Methods: Between 2000 and 2015, data on 31 587 patients with established NAFLD were collected for analysis. A control group (n = 31 587) assembled for comparison was matched for sex, age, treating physician, and Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI). Results: By 10 years after the index date, 15.3% of patients with NAFLD and 13.4% of patients in the control group had been diagnosed with cancer (p <0.001). Patients with NAFLD exhibited significantly higher rates of male genital cancers (HR 1.26; 95% confidence interval [1.06; 1.5]; p = 0.008), skin cancer (HR 1.22 [1.07; 1.38]; p = 0.002) and breast cancer (HR 1.2 [1.01; 1.43]; p = 0.036). In this analysis, the rate of hepatocellular carcinoma did not differ between patients with NAFLD and patients without NAFLD (0.19% vs. 0.12%; p = 0.204). Conclusion: NAFLD slightly increases the risk of breast cancer in women, genital cancer in men, and skin cancer irrespective of sex. Thus, NAFLD can be considered a marker of increased cancer risk."

Fatty liver is induced after tamoxifen (TAM) inhibition of estrogen receptor activity, but the exact mechanism is not clear. This study investigated the effects and mechanisms of TAM -induced steatosis in the liver. The effects and mechanisms of TAM on hepatocyte lipid metabolism were assessed using C57BL/6 female mice and human hepatoma cells. TAM promoted fat accumulation in the liver by upregulation of Srebp-1c expression. Regarding the molecular mechanism, TAM promoted the recruitment of the auxiliary transcriptional activator, p300, and dissociated the auxiliary transcriptional repressor, nuclear receptor corepressor (NCOR), of the complexes, which led to enhancement of Srebp-1c transcription and an increase of triglyceride (TG) synthesis. Vitamin D (VD), a common fat-soluble vitamin, can decrease TAM -induced NAFLD by promoting p300 dissociation and NCOR recruitment. Tamoxifen promoted the recruitment and dissociation of co -transcription factors on the LXR/ER/RXR receptor complex, leading to a disorder of liver lipid metabolism.

Extrahepatic complications of NAFLD include chronic kidney disease, extrahepatic malignancies (such as colorectal cancer), psychological dysfunction, gastroesophageal reflux disease, obstructive sleep apnea syndrome, periodontitis, hypothyroidism, growth hormone deficiency, and polycystic ovarian syndrome. The objective of this narrative review was to summarize recent evidences about extrahepatic complications of NAFLD, with focus on the prevalent/incident risk of such diseases in patients with NAFLD. To date, an appropriate screening method for extrahepatic complications has not yet been determined. Collaborative care with respective experts seems to be necessary for patient management because extrahepatic complications can occur across multiple organs. Further studies are needed to reveal risk profiles at baseline and to determine an appropriate screening method for extrahepatic diseases."

However, the pathological mechanism is still unclear, and thus, there are no approved drugs on the market. Transcriptional coactivator WW domain-binding protein 2 (WBP2) is a newly discovered oncogene that has an important relationship with the occurrence and development of breast cancer and mediates the interaction between Wnt and various other signaling pathways. The expression level of WBP2 was decreased in NAFLD. Overexpression of WBP2 with AAV in vivo alleviated liver fat deposition and insulin resistance induced by a high-fat diet (HFD). Knockdown of WBP2 with AAV aggravated HFD-induced fatty liver and insulin resistance. In vitro experiments showed that in the human normal hepatocyte cell line LO2 and primary hepatocytes isolated from mice, overexpression of WBP2 reduced fat deposition, and knocking out or knocking down WBP2 aggravated PA-induced fat deposition. Through mass spectrometry, we found that WBP2 can bind to AMPK beta 1, and by mutating AMPK beta 1, we found that WBP2 can induce phosphorylation of AMPK beta 1 at S108 and then activate the AMPK pathway to affect lipid metabolism. The effect of WBP2 on NAFLD provides a possible new direction for future research on NAFLD."

Pharmacological effects of saffron are mainly attributed to crocin, crocetin, picrocrocin and safranal. These components especially crocin, have significant effects including antidepressant and anticonvulsant, analgesic, anti-cancer and other therapeutic effects on different parts of our body namely cardiovascular, immune, respiratory, genital-urinary and central nervous system. According to the reports and findings, saffron plays a key role to cure different digestive system disorders via chemopreventive, inhibition of cell proliferation, induction of apoptosis, antioxidant effects and radical scavenging, genoprotective property, prevention of lipid peroxidation and anti-inflammatory processes. The outcome of the above mentioned mechanisms shows potential therapeutic properties of saffron against liver cancer, hepatotoxicity, fatty liver, hyperlipidemia, stomach cancer, peptic ulcer, colon cancer, ulcerative colitis, diabetes and pancreas cancer and ileum contractions. According to global statistics, the susceptibility to intestinal diseases is considered as a significant matter and can be important in health planning in any community. Several strategies for treatment and prevention of the digestive system diseases have provided that the use of herbal remedies seems effective and useful. Considering the available findings, the present study aims to introduce saffron as a prophylactic and therapeutic agent against gastrointestinal tract disorders. However, further clinical studies seem necessary in various aspects of saffron effects in different parts of body to verify these findings."

The transition from 2D monolayer models to dense 3D spheroids in HCI applications is not trivial, however, and requires 3D-optimized protocols, instrumentation, and resources. Here, we discuss considerations for moving from 2D to 3D models and present a framework for HCI and analysis of 3D spheroid models in a drug discovery setting. We combined scaffold-free, multicellular spheroid models with scalable, automation-compatible plate technology enabling image-based applications ranging from high-throughput screening to more complex, lower-throughput microphysiological systems of organ networks.

The results of these proof-of-concept studies demonstrate the potential for high-resolution image-based analysis of 3D spheroid models for drug discovery applications, and confirm that cell-level and temporal-spatial analyses that fully exploit multicellular features of spheroid models are not only possible but soon will be routine practice in drug discovery workflows."

ATP-citrate lyase (ACLY) is a crucial lipogenic enzyme that is up-regulated in individuals with NAFLD. A previous study has shown that acetylation of ACLY at Lys-540, Lys-546, and Lys-554 (ACLY-3K) increases ACLY protein stability by antagonizing its ubiquitylation, thereby promoting lipid synthesis and cell proliferation in lung cancer cells. But the functional importance of this regulatory mechanism in other cellular or tissue contexts or under other pathophysiological conditions awaits further investigation. Here, we show that ACLY-3K acetylation also promotes ACLY protein stability in AML12 cells, a mouse hepatocyte cell line, and found that the deacetylase sirtuin 2 (SIRT2) deacetylates ACLY-3K and destabilizes ACLY in these cells. Of note, the livers of mice and humans with NAFLD had increased ACLY protein and ACLY-3K acetylation levels and decreased SIRT2 protein levels. Mimicking ACLY-3K acetylation by replacing the three lysines with three glutamines (ACLY-3KQ variant) promoted lipid accumulation both in high glucose-treated AML12 cells and in the livers of high-fat/high-sucrose (HF/HS) diet-fed mice. Moreover, overexpressing SIRT2 in AML12 cells inhibited lipid accumulation, which was more efficiently reversed by overexpressing the ACLY-3KQ variant than by overexpressing WT ACLY. Additionally, hepatic SIRT2 overexpression decreased ACLY-3K acetylation and its protein level and alleviated hepatic steatosis in HF/HS diet-fed mice.

Using a transgenic mouse model of fatty liver disease, a team led by Philipp Scherer from the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, USA, and Jiyoung Park of Ulsan National Institute of Science and Technology, South Korea, showed that liver-specific accumulation of a collagen fragment known as endotrophin leads to activation of inflammatory and fibrotic pathways. The mice subsequently develop metabolic dysfunction, insulin resistance and, with time, cancerous nodules in the liver. The findings suggest that endotrophin accumulation, when it occurs in liver tissue that already contains large depositions of fat, can overwhelm normal liver physiology and accelerate organ damage. Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is the most common liver disease and can lead to multiple complications, including non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), cirrhosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma. The fibrotic liver is characterized by the pathological accumulation of extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins. Type VI collagen alpha3 (Col6a3) is a biomarker of hepatic fibrosis, and its cleaved form, endotrophin (ETP), plays a critical role in adipose tissue dysfunction, insulin resistance, and breast cancer development. Here, we studied the effects of the Col6a3-derived peptide ETP on the progression of chronic liver diseases, such as NASH and liver cancer. We used a doxycycline (Dox)-inducible liver-specific ETP-overexpressing mouse model on a NAFLD-prone (liver-specific SREBP1a transgenic) background. For this, we evaluated the consequences of local ETP expression in the liver and its effect on hepatic inflammation, fibrosis, and insulin resistance. Accumulation of ETP in the liver induced hepatic inflammation and the development of fibrosis with associated insulin resistance. Surprisingly, ETP overexpression also led to the emergence of liver cancer within 10 months in the SREBP1a transgenic background. Our data revealed that ETP can act as a ""second hit"" during the progression of NAFLD and can play an important role in the development of NASH and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). These observations firmly link elevated levels of ETP to chronic liver disease."

Results: Overall, 51 metastases were found by histopathology of the resected liver segments/lobes. The size of the metastases ranged from 0.4 to 13 cm, with 18 (35%) being up to 1 cm in diameter. In the overall rating, MDCT detected 33/51 lesions (65%), and MRI 45/51 (88%). For lesions up to 1 cm, MDCT detected only 2/18 (11%) and MRI 12/18 (66%). One false positive lesion was detected by MDCT. Statistical analysis showed that MRI is markedly superior to MDCT, with a statistically significant difference (p < .001), particularly for the detection of small lesions (<= 1 cm; p < .004). There was no significant difference between the two modalities in the detection of lesions >1 cm. Conclusion: For the detection of colorectal liver metastases after neoadjuvant chemotherapy and consecutive diffuse fatty infiltration of the liver, MRI is superior to MDCT, especially for the detection of small lesions.

It has been proven that obesity is associated with several gastroenterological diseases, while the mechanisms of these associations are extremely heterogeneous and multifactorial. Hypertrophy and hyperplasia of adipocytes in obesity lead to a change in the profile of adipokine production (a decrease in adiponectin, an increase in leptin), an increase in the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines (interleukin-1, 6, 8, tumor necrosis factor a), C-reactive protein, free fatty acids, as well as active forms of oxygen (superoxide radicals, H2O2). All the above induces the development of chronic slowly progressive inflammation, oxidative stress, and insulin resistance. In addition, peptides secreted by adipocytes (adiponectin, leptin, nesfatin-1 and apelin) can modulate gastrointestinal motility, acting both centrally and peripherally. The qualitative and quantitative changes in the intestinal microbiota observed in obese patients (increased Firmicutes and decreased Bacteroidetes) lead to a decrease in the production of short-chain fatty acids and an increase in the intestinal permeability due to disruption of intercellular tight junctions, which leads to increased translocation of bacteria and endotoxins into the systemic circulation. Numerous studies have demonstrated the association of obesity with diseases of the esophagus (gastroesophageal reflux disease, Barrett's esophagus, esophageal adenocarcinoma, esophageal motility disorders), stomach (functional dyspepsia, stomach cancer), gallbladder (cholelithiasis, gallbladder cancer), pancreas (acute pancreatitis, pancreatic cancer), liver (non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, hepatocellular carcinoma), intestine (diverticular disease, irritable bowel syndrome, colorectal cancer)."

The ability of SHP to bind directly to multiple NRs is crucial for its physiological function as a transcriptional inhibitor of gene expression. A wide variety of interacting partners for SHP have been identified, indicating the potential for SHP to regulate an array of genes in different biological pathways. In this review, we summarize studies concerning the structure and target genes of SHP and discuss recent progress in understanding the function of SHP in bile acid, cholesterol, triglyceride, glucose, and drug metabolism. In addition, we review the regulatory role of SHP in microRNA (miRNA) regulation, liver fibrosis and cancer progression. The fact that SHP controls a complex set of genes in multiple metabolic pathways suggests the intriguing possibility of developing new therapeutics for metabolic diseases, including fatty liver, dyslipidemia and obesity, by regulating SHP with small molecules. To achieve this goal, more progress regarding SHP ligands and protein structure will be required. Besides its metabolic regulatory function, studies by us and other groups provide strong evidence that SHP plays a critical role in the development of cancer, particularly liver and breast cancer.

VDAC1 ' s interactions with over 150 proteins can mediate and regulate the integration of mitochondrial functions with cellular activities. To target these protein-protein interactions, VDAC1-derived peptides have been developed. This review focuses specifically on cell-penetrating VDAC1-based peptides that were developed and used as a ""decoy"" to compete with VDAC1 for its VDAC1-interacting proteins. These peptides interfere with VDAC1 interactions, for example, with metabolism-associated proteins such as hexokinase (HK), or with anti-apoptotic proteins such as Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL. These and other VDAC1-interacting proteins are highly expressed in many cancers. The VDAC1-based peptides in cells in culture selectively affect cancerous, but not non-cancerous cells, inducing cell death in a variety of cancers, regardless of the cancer origin or genetics. They inhibit cell energy production, eliminate cancer stem cells, and act very rapidly and at low micro-molar concentrations. The activity of these peptides has been validated in several mouse cancer models of glioblastoma, lung, and breast cancers. Their anti-cancer activity involves a multi-pronged attack targeting the hallmarks of cancer. They were also found to be effective in treating non-alcoholic fatty liver disease and diabetes mellitus. Thus, VDAC1-based peptides, by targeting VDAC1-interacting proteins, offer an affordable and innovative new conceptual therapeutic paradigm that can potentially overcome heterogeneity, chemoresistance, and invasive metastatic formation."

The primary risk factor was being Hp negative or positive. The primary endpoint was the presence of NAFLD defined by ultrasound (NAFLD; primary endpoint). Uni- and multivariable logistic regression models were fitted to obtain odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (95%CI). Finally, this association was analyzed in a subgroup of 1128 patients in whom NAFLD was diagnosed by transient elastography (TE, secondary endpoint). RESULTS: NAFLD prevalence defined by ultrasound did not differ between Hp positive (48%) and negative patients (45%, P=0.097). Accordingly, in uni- (OR 1.12 95% CI 0.98-1.29; P=0.098) and multivariable analysis adjusting for different risk factors (aOR 0.96 95%CI 0.82-1.13; P=0.601) no independent association was found. On subgroup analysis, NAFLD diagnosed by TE was more prevalent in the Hp positive compared to the Hp negative group (49% vs. 38%, P=0.004) and these patients also had higher steatosis grades. However, after adjustment for risk factors, no independent association between Hp positivity and NAFLD diagnosed by TE (aOR 1.26 95%CI 0.89-1.78; P=0.194) was confirmed. CONCLUSIONS: In this Central European cohort, Hp-positivity was not associated with the diagnosis of NAFLD. Although Hp positive patients seem to be more likely to have a concomitant NAFLD diagnosis, this association might rather relate to a cardiometabolic risk phenotype than causality."

The purpose of this study was to investigate the prevalence of hepatic steatosis in an asymptomatic U. S. adult population using attenuation values at unenhanced CT as the reference standard. We also assessed the utility of known clinical risk factors for diagnosis. MATERIALS AND METHODS. For 3,357 consecutive asymptomatic adults (1,865 women and 1,492 men; mean age, 57.0 years), hepatic and splenic CT attenuation values (Hounsfield units) were obtained by unenhanced CT using a low-dose colonography technique for colorectal cancer screening. Multiple attenuation criteria for steatosis were applied, including liver thresholds and comparison of liver and spleen attenuation. Relevant clinical risk factors were compared against a CT liver attenuation <= 40 HU, which has been shown to exclude mild steatosis. RESULTS. Mean liver attenuation was 58.8 +/- 10.8 (SD) HU. The prevalence of moderate-to-severe hepatic steatosis (defined by liver attenuation <= 40 HU) was 6.2% (208/3,357). For CT attenuation criteria that include milder degrees of steatosis, prevalence increased to as high as 45.9% (1,542/3,357) for a liver-to-spleen attenuation ratio of <= 1.1. Overweight status (body mass index >25) was a sensitive indicator for moderate-to-severe steatosis (92.8%) but was highly nonspecific (37.5%). Other clinical risk factors, such as diabetes, dyslipidemia, hypertension, alcohol overuse, and hepatitis, were more specific (77.6-92.4%) but highly insensitive (1.9-37.5%). Combining clinical risk factors did not substantially increase the accuracy for screening. CONCLUSION. Assessment of liver attenuation by use of unenhanced CT represents an objective and noninvasive means for detection of asymptomatic hepatic steatosis, whereas clinical risk factor assessment is unreliable. Further longitudinal investigation is needed to determine the most appropriate attenuation threshold and the risk for disease progression to steatohepatitis and cirrhosis."

178,92,92,Risk for hepatic and extra-hepatic outcomes in nonalcoholic fatty liver disease,"Hagström, H; Kechagias, S; Ekstedt, M",10.1111/joim.13343,"Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is defined by presence of steatosis in more than 5% of liver cells. The gold standard for diagnosis is liver biopsy, but this is seldom achieved due to costs and risk for side effects, and that is why the diagnosis is mostly made based on a combination of radiology and exclusion of other liver diseases. Disease severity staging can be noninvasively achieved with radiological exams such as elastography or blood-based markers that usually have lower sensitivity and specificity. NAFLD is today the most common chronic liver disease globally with a prevalence estimated to be 25%. Fortunately, for many persons NAFLD is an incidental finding with a good prognosis. Whilst a major focus has been on liver-related outcomes in NAFLD, there has recently been an increased interest in extrahepatic consequences of NAFLD. The most commonly studied outcomes include cardiovascular disease and cancer. The risk of adverse outcomes generally differs according to the baseline fibrosis stage. There is a five-time higher risk of liver-related events in NAFLD patients with fibrosis stage 3 as compared to those with no or little fibrosis. Meanwhile, the presence of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) does not seem to influence prognosis in addition to fibrosis stage. Patients with NAFLD clearly have a higher risk for cardiovascular outcomes compared to the general population, with a recent meta-analysis indicating a 37% increased hazard for cardiovascular events as opposed to individuals without NAFLD. The risk of liver cancer is increased, which is mostly driven by presence of cirrhosis, but the increased risk is present also in patients without cirrhosis, and to a greater extent than for other chronic liver disease. Around one-third of patients with NAFLD and liver cancer do not have cirrhosis. Additionally, the risk of extrahepatic malignancies is thought to be moderately increased, with most evidence for a link between NAFLD and colorectal cancer where the risk is approximately 50% higher compared to patients without NAFLD. A particularly salient point is if NAFLD can be considered an independent risk factor for outcomes. Many studies have not been able to adjust for key confounders, or suffer from different forms of bias. The clinical problem is nevertheless to identify persons with an increased risk for adverse hepatic and extrahepatic outcomes. We here discuss the evidence linking NAFLD to severe hepatic and extrahepatic outcomes."

Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) reflects manifestation of obesity in the liver, it ranges from simple steatosis to advanced fibrosis and cirrhosis. The clinical burden of NAFLD is not confined to the liver, recent studies have suggested that NAFLD has carcinogenic effects from dyslipidemia, insulin resistance and obesity and can increase risk of extra hepatic neoplasm, breast and gastrointestinal cancers to name few. However, the relationship of NAFLD with lung cancer is not reported as yet, the association of metabolic factors particularly obesity with lung cancer in the literature is still conflicting, we used a large database to explore the association. METHODS: We reviewed charts from a commercial database (Explorys Inc, Cleveland, OH, USA) which is an aggregate of electronic health records data from 26 major healthcare systems throughout the United States. We included all active patients between ages 30 and 85. A cohort of patients with a Systematized Nomenclature of Medicine-Clinical Terms of “Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease” was identified. The outcome was Lung cancer between 2018 and 2021. We excluded patients with history of malignancy, the prevalence of lung cancer in patients with NAFLD was calculated, univariate analysis applied, predictors were age, gender, race, tobacco smoking, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, interstitial lung disease, lung fibrosis and human immunodeficiency virus infection. RESULTS: Out of 80,353,220 individuals in the database (2018-2021), 601,990 had diagnosis of NAFLD (study group). The prevalence of Lung cancer in this group was 0.44%, which is five times higher than the prevalence in the (control group) who had no NALFD 0.09%. In univariate analysis, compared to control group, patients who had NAFLD were statistically more likely to develop Lung cancer {OR: 4.98; 95% CI 4.79-5.17, P value < 0.001}. This was observed particularly in patients who were smokers, male, african American, and elderly (age > 70), smoking was the most strong predictors {OR: 6.25; 95% CI 5.48-6.65, P value < 0.001} CONCLUSIONS: Our study shows increase risk of lung cancer in NAFLD patients compared to general population, the risk was observed particularly in smokers, male, african americans and advance age. Limitations include being retrospective, the risk was not linked to certain histological sub types of lung cancer and inability to evaluate the impact of NAFLD severity on the cancer risk. CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: This risk remains uncertain and not fully explored, knowing that cancer is the 2nd cause of death in NAFLD patients after cardiovascular disease, further prospective studies needed to enlighten more on the risk of Lung cancer on NAFLD population.

183,98,98,Short-term postoperative outcomes of colorectal cancer among patients with chronic liver disease: a national population-based study,"Lee, KC; Chung, KC; Chen, HH; Cheng, KC; Wu, KL; Lu, CC",10.1136/bmjopen-2017-020511,"Objective Patients with colorectal carcinoma (CRC) with pre-existing chronic liver disease (CLD) had a significantly higher 30-day mortality after CRC surgery compared with healthy controls. This study investigated the factors associated with postoperative complications and in-hospital mortality in patients with CRC with coexisting CLD (excluding cirrhosis) who underwent colorectal surgery. Design A retrospective, observational, population-based study. Setting Data were sourced from the National Inpatient Sample database, a part of the Healthcare Cost and Utilisation Project. Participants This study analysed 7463 inpatients with CRC who underwent colorectal surgery on admission between 2005 and 2014. Primary and secondary outcome measures The primary endpoint of this study was the prevalence of postoperative complications, and the secondary endpoint was in-hospital mortality. Results In the CLD group, 36.27% of patients had chronic hepatitis C, 28.36% had non-alcoholic fatty liver disease and 31.19% had other types of CLD. The median hospital stay was 7.0 (5.0-10.0) days in patients with no postoperative complications vs 17.0 (10.0-26.0) days, 8.0 (6.0-12.0) days, 8.0 (6.0-17.0) days, 9.0 (8.0-14.0) days and 10.5 (7.0-17.0) days for patients with postoperative infection, postoperative bleeding, cardiac arrest/heart failure, respiratory complications and digestive complications, respectively (all p<0.05). The presence of CLD was significantly associated with higher risk of postoperative bleeding (adjusted OR (aOR)=1.64, 95% CI 1.15 to 2.34, p=0.007). The presence of CLD (aOR=1.98, 95% CI 1.39 to 2.82, p<0.001) and length of hospital stay (aOR=1.06, 95% CI 1.04 to 1.08, p<0.001) were significantly associated with higher risk of in-hospital mortality. However, hyperlipidaemia was associated with a significantly lower risk of mortality (aOR=0.46, 95% CI 0.28 to 0.75, p=0.002).

184,98,2790,Short-term postoperative outcomes of colorectal cancer among patients with chronic liver disease: a national population-based study.,Lee KC; Chung KC; Chen HH; Cheng KC; Wu KL; Lu CC,10.1136/bmjopen-2017-020511,"OBJECTIVE: Patients with colorectal carcinoma (CRC) with pre-existing chronic liver disease (CLD) had a significantly higher 30-day mortality after CRC surgery compared with healthy controls. This study investigated the factors associated with postoperative complications and in-hospital mortality in patients with CRC with coexisting CLD (excluding cirrhosis) who underwent colorectal surgery. DESIGN: A retrospective, observational, population-based study. SETTING: Data were sourced from the National Inpatient Sample database, a part of the Healthcare Cost and Utilisation Project. PARTICIPANTS: This study analysed 7463 inpatients with CRC who underwent colorectal surgery on admission between 2005 and 2014. PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary endpoint of this study was the prevalence of postoperative complications, and the secondary endpoint was in-hospital mortality. RESULTS: In the CLD group, 36.27% of patients had chronic hepatitis C, 28.36% had non-alcoholic fatty liver disease and 31.19% had other types of CLD. The median hospital stay was 7.0 (5.0-10.0) days in patients with no postoperative complications vs 17.0 (10.0-26.0) days, 8.0 (6.0-12.0) days, 8.0 (6.0-17.0) days, 9.0 (8.0-14.0) days and 10.5 (7.0-17.0) days for patients with postoperative infection, postoperative bleeding, cardiac arrest/heart failure, respiratory complications and digestive complications, respectively (all p<0.05). The presence of CLD was significantly associated with higher risk of postoperative bleeding (adjusted OR (aOR)=1.64, 95% CI 1.15 to 2.34, p=0.007). The presence of CLD (aOR=1.98, 95% CI 1.39 to 2.82, p<0.001) and length of hospital stay (aOR=1.06, 95% CI 1.04 to 1.08, p<0.001) were significantly associated with higher risk of in-hospital mortality. However, hyperlipidaemia was associated with a significantly lower risk of mortality (aOR=0.46, 95% CI 0.28 to 0.75, p=0.002). CONCLUSIONS: Postoperative complications prolonged the length of hospital stay. The presence of CLD and hyperlipidaemia were important factors impacting postoperative complications and in-hospital mortality in patients with CRC with underlying CLD. commercial re-use.

Aims: We aimed to explore the cancer risk by MASLD and MetALD. Methods: This nationwide cohort study included 3,596,709 participants who underwent a health check-up in 2011 in South Korea. Steatotic liver disease (SLD) was defined as a fatty liver index ≥30. Participants were categorized into four exclusive groups: MASLD, MetALD, other combination aetiology and no SLD. The subdistribution hazard ratio (SHR) was calculated using the Fine–Gray model after adjusting other variables. Results: During the 33.9 million person-years of follow-up, 285,845 participants (7.9%) developed cancers. Compared with no SLD, MASLD, MetALD and other combination aetiology had an increased risk of all cancer. Liver cancer risk escalated from no SLD to MASLD (SHR, 1.16; 95% CI, 1.12–1.21), MetALD (SHR, 2.06; 95% CI, 1.92–2.20) and other combination aetiology (SHR, 8.16; 95% CI, 7.69–8.67). Gastrointestinal cancers including oesophagus, stomach, colorectal, biliary and pancreas cancers increased in MASLD (SHR, 1.13; 95% CI, 1.11–1.15), MetALD (SHR, 1.17; 95% CI, 1.14–1.21) and other combination aetiology (SHR, 1.09; 95% CI, 1.05–1.13). A modest increase in lung cancer and hormone-sensitive cancer was observed with MASLD. Conclusions: This study showed that MASLD and MetALD are associated with an increased risk of cancer, particularly liver and gastrointestinal cancers. The findings build new evidence for the clinical outcomes of MetALD while highlighting the importance of managing alcohol intake properly in MASLD and MetALD."

This umbrella review aimed to summarise and describe the association using existing systematic reviews and/or meta-analyses. Method: Four databases (Medline, Scopus, Web of Science, and Cochrane Library) were searched for systematic reviews and/or meta-analyses of observational studies. Two independent authors extracted data on the summary estimated effect and heterogeneity of studies using I2 from the individual reviews. The Assessing the Methodological Quality of Systematic Reviews (AMSTAR 2) tool was used to evaluate the methodological quality. Results: 49 articles were included in this review. Although most included studies were graded with critically low methodological quality (81.6 %), we found a significant positive association between obesity (summary relative risk (SRR) range 1.19–1.49), diabetes mellitus (SRR range 1.20–1.37), hypertension (SRR range 1.07–1.62), metabolic syndrome (SRR range 1.25–1.36), non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (pooled odds ratio (POR) range 1.13–1.56), and risk of CRC. Higher serum high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels were associated with a lower risk of CRC in 3/6 reviews, while others did not find any association. There was no clear association between high triglyceride levels, total cholesterol levels, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels, and risk of CRC. Conclusion: This umbrella review identified that most metabolic factors are significantly associated with increased risk of CRC. Thus, people affected by metabolic factors may be benefited from CRC screening and surveillance."

It, however, remains unclear whether such a connection is causal. This study aims to examine the association between NAFLD and CRC using a two-sample bidirectional Mendelian randomization (MR) method. Methods Summary statistics for NAFLD were obtained from four genome-wide association studies, including 8434 cases and 770 180 controls. Meanwhile, CRC and controls (1803 vs. 174 006) were collected from the FinnGen. The inverse variance weighted (IVW) method was used primarily, while sensitivity analyses were conducted via the weighted median, MR Egger method, simple mode, and weighted mode to enhance result reliability. Results We found a positive correlation between NAFLD and CRC by IVW method in the forward MR analysis (odds ratio = 1.270, 95% confidence interval: 1.154–1.398, P = 1.092 × 10−6). Inverse MR analysis, however, suggested that CRC may not have a causal effect on NAFLD. Besides, we observed an absence of horizontal pleiotropy and heterogeneity in this MR analysis.

Hepatectomy is the only potentially curative treatment for CRLM, but few patients with metastatic CRC meet the criteria for this radical resection, and the 5-year survival rate is poor. Identifying risk factors for CRLM is critical. Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is an independent risk factor for CRC. However, the effect of NAFLD on CRC liver metastasis after radical surgery remains unclear. Therefore, we examined the impact of NAFLD-associated hepatic fibrosis on liver metastasis after radical surgery for CRC. Methods: We retrospectively analyzed data from 388 patients who underwent curative surgery for CRC at our hospital between April 2008 and March 2015. The patients’ clinical results, surgical procedures, postoperative course, and pathological and survival data were collected from the hospital records. The NAFLD fibrosis score was calculated and used to divide the patients into two groups (NAFLD and non-NAFLD). Results: Recurrence was observed in 83/388 (21.4%) patients after a mean follow-up of 65.6 ± 15.1 months. Twenty-five patients had liver metastasis: 8 in the NAFLD group (8/45; 17.8%) and 17 in the non-NALFD group (17/343; 5.0%) (p = 0.004). Liver metastasis-free survival was significantly worse in the NAFLD than non-NAFLD group (p < 0.001). NAFLD and cancer stage were independent risk factors for liver metastasis recurrence. Conclusion: NAFLD may be a risk factor for liver metastasis in patients with CRC who undergo curative surgery."

RESULTS: Recurrence was observed in 83/388 (21.4%) patients after a mean follow-up of 65.6 ± 15.1 months. Twenty-five patients had liver metastasis: 8 in the NAFLD group (8/45; 17.8%) and 17 in the non-NALFD group (17/343; 5.0%) (p = 0.004). Liver metastasis-free survival was significantly worse in the NAFLD than non-NAFLD group (p < 0.001). NAFLD and cancer stage were independent risk factors for liver metastasis recurrence. CONCLUSION: NAFLD may be a risk factor for liver metastasis in patients with CRC who undergo curative surgery. Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature."

Fructose is a monosaccharide associated with high risk of diabetes, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, atherosclerosis and visceral obesity. A high fructose diet is a potential cardiometabolic risk factor and may increase cardiac risk in women with breast cancer treated with cardiotoxic drugs. In this study, we highlighted the role of sweeteners fructose in the worsening of cardiotoxicity induced by combinatorial therapy anthracycline-HER2-blocking agents. Methods: Human cardiomyocytes were pre-exposed with doxorubicin combined to trastuzumab (at 300 and 1000 nM) for 48 and 72h alone or combined to fructose at 0.25, 1 and 2.5 mM. After the incubation period, we performed the following tests: determination of cell viability, through mitochondrial dehydrogenase activity, study of lipid peroxidation (quantifying cellular Malondialdehyde and 4- hydroxynonenal), intracellular Ca2+ homeostasis. Moreover, pro-inflammatory studied were also performed (activation of NLRP3 inflammasome; expression of peroxisome proliferatoractivated receptor-a; transcriptional activation of p65/NF-κB and secretion of cytokines involved in cardiotoxicity (Interleukins 1b, 8, 6, CXCL-12). Results: High fructose increases significantly cell mortality of cardiomyocytes exposed to doxorubicin and trastuzumab through the activation of NLRP-3 and Myd-88 expression. Intracellular Ca++ levels were also increased of 4 times compared to non-fructose exposed cardiomyocytes; MDA and 4-HNA levels were increased of 48,3 and 51,2 % compared to non-fructose exposed cells (p<0.001). Fructose increases IL-1, IL-6 and CXCL-12 expression in cardiomyocytes in a concentration dependent manner, compared to doxorubicin-trastuzumab group (p<0.05). Conclusions: Data of the present study indicate that fructose induces a pro-inflammatory phenotype in human cardiac cells exposed to anticancer cardiotoxic drugs, providing even more data on the harmful role of fructose as a key player of cardiotoxic phenomena."

However, no MUC1 targeted therapeutic has yet succeeded or has been granted FDA approval. Although MUC1 is overexpressed on cancer cells, it is also widely expressed on normal epithelial cells. We previously reported that a MUC1 transmembrane cleavage product, MUC1∗ (muk 1 star), is a Class I growth factor receptor activated by ligandinduced dimerization of its truncated extra cellular domain. We generated monoclonal antibodies that recognize the specific conformation that is created when MUC1 is cleaved by specific enzymes expressed in the tumor microenvironment. 93% of human breast cancer tissues are recognized by one of these antibodies, huMNC2, which importantly does not bind to normal MUC1. We have incorporated this antibody into two CARs, wherein one bears the 1XX mutations in CD3z that greatly increase CAR-T cell persistence, inhibit exhaustion and enable the killing of low antigen expressing cancer cells. Methods: Phase I for huMNC2-CAR44, an autologous frozen product, opened January, 2020, but as a 1st-in-human trial was paused during COVID. All patients receive 300 mg/m2 cyclophosphamide and 30 mg/m2 fludarabine for 3 days prior to CAR-T treatment. Dose escalation from 3.3x105 - 1x107 CAR+ cells/kg follows a standard 3 + 3 design. In addition to standard organ function inclusion criteria, the trial was first open to breast cancer patients whose cancer had progressed after at least 2 or 3 prior therapies while metastatic, yet there was no limit on the number of prior therapies. A recent patient biopsy had to be at least 30% positive for MUC1∗ in a CLIA validated IHC assay. Importantly, there were no limits on the vein-to-vein time. Dose levels 1 and 2 for huMNC2-CAR44 were completed without DLTs. Phase I for huMNC2-CAR22, which bore the 1XX mutations in CD3z to increase persistence and increase the killing of low antigen expressing cells opened September, 2023. Based on responses of initial huMNC2-CAR44 patients, inclusion criteria were amended to an Enrichment Trial Design. The number of prior therapies was limited to less than or equal to 10. Anticipated survival at the time of product infusion should be at least 3 months. Vein-tovein time, which historically had been 15-16 days at one site and as high as 83 days at another site, would be targeted to 16- 22 days. The tumors of eligible patients need to have a MUC1∗ membrane positive H-score equal to or greater than 120 out of a possible 300, defined as high MUC1∗ positivity. Based on IHC analysis of human breast cancer TMAs, the H-score restriction would include roughly 40% of breast cancers. The increased ability of huMNC2-CAR22 to kill low antigen expressing cancer cells may support future studies of patients expressing low levels of MUC1∗."

Methods: MUC1∗ (muk 1 star) is the growth factor receptor form of MUC1, created by cleavage and release of the N-terminal portion of MUC1. The targeting antibody, huMNC2, only recognizes the conformational epitope created when MUC1 is cleaved by specific tumor-associated enzymes that are correlated with poor prognosis. huMNC2 does not bind to full-length MUC1, which is expressed on all normal epithelial cells. huMNC2-scFv was incorporated into huMNC2-CAR44, comprising a CD8 hinge and transmembrane region, 4-1BB costimulatory domain and wild-type CD3z. huMNC2-scFv was also incorporated into huMNC2-CAR22 wherein the hinge, transmembrane and co-stimulatory portions were derived from CD28 and CD3z bears the 1XX mutations to increase in vivo persistence. Inclusion criteria require that the patient's tumor is at least 30% MUC1∗ positive and that patient has progressed through 2 or 3 prior therapies, while in the metastatic setting. Patients receive standard Cy/Flu lymphodepletion approximately 3-days before CAR T treatment, administered at 1 of 4 dose levels ranging from 3.3X10-5 up to 1.0X10-7 CAR+ T cells. Results: To date, 8 patients have been treated with huMNC2-CAR44. No patients experienced neuro toxicities. No off-target toxicities were observed. 3 patients experienced CRS Grade 1-3. In 6 of the 8 patients, side effects were non-existent or minimal. However, one patient experienced a Grade 5 SAE that was deemed to be possibly related to the treatment. Best responses include Partial Responses and Stable Disease at a low CAR-T dose. Greatest efficacy was observed for patients whose biopsy showed H Scores >120. Patients are currently being enrolled for treatment with huMNC2-CAR22, where the 1XX mutations are expected to increase in vivo persistence, durability of response and reduced incidence of CRS. Conclusions: These data support a conclusion that the MUC1∗ antibody, huMNC2, is safe and could have high therapeutic value as a CAR T treatment for solid tumors with moderate to high antigen density. As the huMNC2-CAR22 (1XX) trial proceeds, we will assess if patient responses mirror our animal results that show that the 1XX mutations confer increased persistence, reduced exhaustion and the ability to kill tumors with low antigen density."

Clinical Quality Indicators (CQIs) enable the systematic identification and alleviation of variations in care and other evidence-practice gaps. The aim of this review was to describe and evaluate lung cancer CQIs utilised internationally, in order to provide a substrate for the development of Australasian lung cancer CQIs and future quality improvement initiatives. A literature search was performed to identify relevant publications; references were excluded if they did not explicitly define original lung cancer-specific quality indicators, or were review or opinion articles. Ultimately, 48 publications containing 661 individual CQIs were evaluated. Although almost all references were published in the last decade, CQIs did not always reflect contemporary standards of care. For example, there were just sixteen CQIs regarding biomarker profiling, eleven CQIs regarding multidisciplinary team review, and three clinical trial enrolment CQIs. Of 307 lung cancer treatment CQIs, almost half (1 3 7) pertain to surgical resection; a treatment option available to a minority of lung cancer patients. Consumer engagement during indicator development was uncommon. In conclusion, whilst CQIs are widely measured and reported, they are not always consistent with evidence-based practice, nor do they reliably support the holistic evaluation of the lung cancer care continuum. Moving forward, Australia and New Zealand must adopt a unified, evidence-based and patient-centred approach to drive meaningful improvements in practice."
215,457,635,International standards of care in thoracic oncology: A narrative review,"Nash, J.; Brims, F.",10.1111/resp.14460,"Introduction: Unwarranted variations in lung cancer care have been widely described. Many countries utilise lung cancer clinical quality registries and/or clinical quality indicators (CQIs) to address such unwarranted variations. The aim of this research was to evaluate and describe international lung cancer CQIs, and therefore provide a substrate for future lung cancer quality improvement programs. Methods: A literature search was performed in Medline to identify English-language publications that developed and/or evaluated lung cancer-specific CQIs. Reference lists, conference abstracts and grey literature were also searched. Publications were excluded if they were limited to a single component of care, duplicated previously described indicatorsor were review articles. Results: In total, 29 publications containing 422 individual CQIs were evaluated. No mesothelioma, thymoma or carcinoid CQIs were identified. CQIs were heterogeneous, and did not always reflect contemporary practice - for example, 12/29 publications had a molecular testing CQI, 8 publications had a multidisciplinary team review CQI, and 3 referred to clinical trial enrolment. Just 2 publications referenced endobronchial/endoscopic ultrasound to perform invasive mediastinal staging. Surgical CQIs dominated treatment indicators, with a total of 46 surgical CQIs; in comparison, there were 18 chemotherapy CQIs, 15 systemic therapy CQIs, 15 radiotherapy CQIs, and 6 CQIs for immunotherapy and targeted therapy. Patient-centred CQIs including specialist lung cancer nurse support and quality of life assessment were very uncommon (2 and 6 publications respectively). Only 5 publications appeared to have consumer input during CQI development. Conclusion: Hundreds of lung cancer CQIs are used internationally, although they are not always consistent with current evidence-based practice. This may reflect the rapidly evolving evidence base, local practice or resource constraints. These data may inform the development of Australasian lung cancer CQIs."

Methods A retrospective, cross-sectional study was conducted at the First People's Hospital of Kunshan, Jiangsu, China. The study included 3028 adults who underwent abdominal ultrasonography and colonoscopy over a 5 year period. We compared characteristics among patients with adenomatous polyps, non-adenomatous polyps, and without colorectal polyps using descriptive statistics. Logistic regression analyses were used to detect associations between NAFLD with the prevalence of adenomatous polyps and non-adenomatous polyps. NAFLD was determined by abdominal ultrasound. Colorectal polyps were assessed by data in the colonoscopy report and pathology report. Results A total of 65% of patients with NAFLD had colorectal polys (52% adenomatous polyps and 13% non-adenomatous polyps), and 40% of patients without NAFLD had polyps (29% adenomatous polyps and 11% non-adenomatous polyps). After adjusting for confounding variables, NAFLD was significantly associated with the prevalence of adenomatous in males and females [odds ratio (OR) = 1.8, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.6-2.2, P < 0.01], but was not associated with non-adenomatous polyps (OR = 1.2, 95% CI:0.9-1.5, P > 0.05). Conclusion NAFLD is associated with an increased risk of colorectal adenomatous polyps compared to the absence of polyps, but not associated with an increased risk of non-adenomatous polyps. These results provide important evidence for the prevention of CRC in patients with NAFLD."

After adjusting for confounding variables, NAFLD was significantly associated with the prevalence of adenomatous in males and females [odds ratio (OR) = 1.8, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.6-2.2, P  < 0.01], but was not associated with non-adenomatous polyps (OR = 1.2, 95% CI:0.9-1.5, P  > 0.05). CONCLUSION: NAFLD is associated with an increased risk of colorectal adenomatous polyps compared to the absence of polyps, but not associated with an increased risk of non-adenomatous polyps. These results provide important evidence for the prevention of CRC in patients with NAFLD."

The aim of the present study is to assess the extent to which preoperative body composition impacts on postoperative complication severity and survival in patients undergoing pancreatoduodenectomy for cancer. Methods: A retrospective cohort study was performed on consecutive patients who underwent pancreatoduodenectomy with preoperative CT scan imaging available. Body composition parameters including total abdominal muscle area (TAMA), visceral fat area (VFA), subcutaneous fat area (SFA) and liver steatosis were assessed. Sarcopenic obesity was defined as a high VFA/TAMA ratio (>3.2). Postoperative complication burden was evaluated with the comprehensive complication index (CCI). Results: Overall, 371 patients were included in the study. At 90 days after surgery, 80 patients (22%) experienced major complications. The median CCI was 20.9 (IQR 0-30). At multivariate linear regression analysis, preoperative biliary drainage, ASA score ≥3, fistula risk score and sarcopenic obesity (37% increase; 95% CI 0.06-0.74; p=0.046) are correlated to increase CCI. Patients’ characteristics associated to sarcopenic obesity were: older age, male gender, obesity and preoperative LS. At a median follow-up of 25 months (IQR 18-49), median disease-free survival (DFS) was 19 months (IQR 15-22). At cox-regression analysis, only pathological features were associated with DFS, while liver steatosis and other body composition measures did not show a prognostic role. Conclusion: The combination of sarcopenia and visceral obesity was significantly associated with increased complication severity after pancreatoduodenectomy for cancer. Patients’ body composition did not affect disease free survival after pancreatic cancer surgery."

Methods: Clinical liver specimens from 50 hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) developed from non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), 49 HCCs developed from chronic viral hepatitis C (CHc), and 48 liver metastases of colorectal cancer (CRC) from both tumorous and non-tumorous areas were collected during hepatic resection surgery. They were evaluated by immunohistochemical analyses of hematoxylin–eosin, Masson's trichrome, NRF2, and KEAP1, and compared with clinicopathological information. Results: Hepatic inflammation and fibrosis were more severe in the low-intensity NRF2 group than in the high-intensity NRF2 group both between CRC and NASH (Low vs. High: inflammation; p = 0.003, fibrosis; p = 0.014), and between CRC and CHc (Low vs. High: inflammation; p = 0.031, fibrosis; p = 0.011), which could indicate that NRF2 expression in cytosol of hepatocytes was inversely correlated with liver inflammation and fibrosis in non-tumorous areas.

Psychological heterogeneity in clinical trial populations contributes to selection bias and may affect treatment outcomes and inevitably trial results. Objectives: The objective of this study was to characterize for the first time the main interpersonal values of patients who participated in Phase II and III clinical trials. Methods: This multicenter observational study included 200 participants from 4 different hospitals who participated in a Phase II or III clinical trial. Patients from different therapeutic areas were included in this study. The patients’ interpersonal values were studied using the Survey of Interpersonal Values (SIV). The SIV scale is grouped into six subscales that assess specific personal values: (1) support, the need to be treated with kindness and to receive encouragement from other people; (2) conformity, the extent to which one does what is acceptable and considered socially correct; (3) recognition, the need to be highly regarded and admired, to be considered important and recognized by others; (4) independence, the extent to which individuals feel free to make their own decisions; (5) benevolence, the capacity to understand and show generosity towards the less fortunate; and (6) leadership, the value ascribed to coordinating the work of others, being selected for a leadership position, and being in a position to tell others what to do. The results obtained from the patient population were classified using the following categories: “very high” (P95–P99), “high” (P70–90), “medium” (P35–65) low” (P10–30), or “very low” (P1–5), and subsequently compared with those of the Portuguese normative population. Results: Compared with the normative population, regardless of the patient’s underlying disease, the percentile frequency distributions were significantly higher for the independence (p < 0.001) and benevolence (p < 0.001) subscales, and significantly lower for the leadership (p < 0.001) and recognition (p < 0.001) subscales in the patient population. Patient distribution according to underlying disease differed significantly relative differences in distribution relative to the normative population for the majority of subscales. Non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), heart failure, myocardial infarction, lung cancer, and rheumatoid arthritis patients were those for which the greatest differences were observed across diseases, while stroke, multiple sclerosis, and HIV patients showed the least differences relative to the normative population. Conclusions: This novel analysis of the interpersonal values of patients that participate in Phase II and III clinical trials revealed that the patients’ interpersonal values largely differed from those of the Portuguese normative population. Better understanding the implications of these findings for clinical trial representativeness and outcomes is of crucial importance."

Here, we investigated whether metformin, an antidiabetic drug with additional pleiotropic effects could favourably offset AC-T induced toxicities. Patients and Methods: Seventy non-diabetic breast cancer patients were randomised to receive either AC-T (adriamycin 60 mg/m2 + cyclophosphamide 600 mg/m2 × 4 cycles Q21 days, followed by weekly paclitaxel 80 mg/m2 × 12 cycles) alone or AC-T plus metformin (1700 mg/day). Patients were assessed regularly after each cycle to record the incidence and severity of adverse events based on the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI-CTCAE), version 5.0. Moreover, baseline echocardiography and ultrasonography were done and repeated after the end of neoadjuvant therapy. Results: Addition of metformin to AC-T resulted in significantly less incidence and severity of peripheral neuropathy, oral mucositis, and fatigue (p < 0.05) compared to control arm. Moreover, the left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF%) in the control arm dropped from a mean of 66.69 ± 4.57 to 62.2 ± 5.22% (p = 0.0004) versus a preserved cardiac function in the metformin arm (64.87 ± 4.84 to 65.94 ± 3.44%, p = 0.2667). Furthermore, fatty liver incidence was significantly lower in metformin compared with control arm (8.33% vs 51.85%, p = 0.001). By contrast, haematological disturbances caused by AC-T were preserved after concurrent metformin administration (p > 0.05). Conclusion: Metformin offers a therapeutic opportunity for controlling toxicities caused by neoadjuvant chemotherapy in non-diabetic breast cancer patients.

Purpose: To compare selected existing mammography artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms and the Breast Cancer Surveillance Consortium (BCSC) risk model for prediction of 5-year risk. Materials and Methods: This retrospective case-cohort study included data in women with a negative screening mammographic examination (no visible evidence of cancer) in 2016, who were followed until 2021 at Kaiser Permanente Northern California. Women with prior breast cancer or a highly penetrant gene mutation were excluded. Of the 324 009 eligible women, a random subcohort was selected, regardless of cancer status, to which all additional patients with breast cancer were added. The index screening mammographic examination was used as input for five AI algorithms to generate continuous scores that were compared with the BCSC clinical risk score. Risk estimates for incident breast cancer 0 to 5 years after the initial mammographic examination were calculated using a time-dependent area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). Results: The subcohort included 13 628 patients, of whom 193 had incident cancer. Incident cancers in eligible patients (additional 4391 of 324 009) were also included. For incident cancers at 0 to 5 years, the time-dependent AUC for BCSC was 0.61 (95% CI: 0.60, 0.62). AI algorithms had higher time-dependent AUCs than did BCSC, ranging from 0.63 to 0.67 (Bonferroni-adjusted P < .0016). Time-dependent AUCs for combined BCSC and AI models were slightly higher than AI alone (AI with BCSC time-dependent AUC range, 0.66-0.68; Bonferroni-adjusted P < .0016). Conclusion: When using a negative screening examination, AI algorithms performed better than the BCSC risk model for predicting breast cancer risk at 0 to 5 years. Combined AI and BCSC models further improved prediction."

PATIENTS AND METHODS: In this case-cohort study, women who had a screening mammogram in 2016 at Kaiser Permanente Northern California with no evidence of cancer on final imaging assessment were followed through September 2021. Women with prior breast cancer or a known highly penetrant gene mutation were excluded. From the 329,814 total eligible women, a random subcohort of 13,881 women (4.2%) were selected, of whom 197 had incident cancer. All 4,475 additional incident cancers were also included. Continuous AI-predicted scores were generated from the index 2016 mammogram. Risk estimates were generated with the Kaplan-Meier method and time-varying area under the curve [AUC(t)]. RESULTS: For incident cancers at 0-1 year (interval cancer risk), BCSC demonstrated an AUC(t) of 0.62 (95% CI, 0.58-0.66), and the AI algorithms had AUC(t)s ranging from 0.66-0.71, all significantly higher than BCSC (P < .05). For incident cancers at 1 to 5 years (5-year future cancer risk), BCSC demonstrated an AUC(t) of 0.61 (95% CI, 0.60-0.62), and the AI algorithms had AUC(t)s ranging from 0.63 to 0.67, all significantly higher than BCSC. Combined BCSC and AI models demonstrated AUC(t)s for interval cancer risk of 0.67-0.73 and for 5-year future cancer risk of 0.66-0.68. CONCLUSION: The AI mammography algorithms we evaluated had significantly higher discrimination than the BCSC clinical risk model for interval and 5-year future cancer risk. Combined AI and BCSC models had slightly higher discrimination than AI alone."

To inform a tailored cancer screen in patients at higher risks, we estimated the global burden of cancer attributable to metabolic risks. Method: Data of common metabolism-related neoplasms (MRNs) were derived from the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) 2019 database. Age-standardized, disability-adjusted life year (DALY) rates and death rates of patients with MRNs were extracted from the GBD 2019 database and stratified by metabolic risk, sex, age, and level of socio-demographic index (SDI). The annual percentage changes of age-standardized DALYs and death rates were calculated. Results: Metabolic risks, consisting high body-mass index and fasting plasma glucose, contributed substantially to the burden of neoplasms, including colorectal cancer (CRC), tracheal, bronchus, and lung cancer (TBLC), etc. Globally, in 2019, therewas an estimated age-standardized DALYs rate (ASDR) of 234.0 (95% CI 124.0–376.0) per 100,000 person-years for neoplasms attributable to metabolic risks. ASDRs of MRNs were higher for CRC, TBLC, men, patients aged ≥50 years, and patients with high or high-middle SDI. Conclusion: These findings further underpin the correlation between NAFLD and intrahepatic and extrahepatic cancers and highlight the possibility of tailored cancer screening for the NAFLD population at higher risks.

The performance of elastography in assessment of fibrosis is poorer in hepatitis B virus (HBV) than in other etiologies of chronic liver disease. AIM To evaluate the performance of ARFI in long-term outcome prediction among different etiologies of chronic liver disease. METHODS Consecutive patients who received an ARFI study between 2011 and 2018 were enrolled. After excluding dual infection, alcoholism, autoimmune hepatitis, and others with incomplete data, this retrospective cohort were divided into hepatitis B (HBV, n = 1064), hepatitis C (HCV, n = 507), and non-HBV, non-HCV (NBNC, n = 391) groups. The indexed cases were linked to cancer registration (1987-2020) and national mortality databases. The differences in morbidity and mortality among the groups were analyzed. RESULTS At the enrollment, the HBV group showed more males (77.5%), a higher prevalence of pre-diagnosed hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), and a lower prevalence of comorbidities than the other groups (P < 0.001). The HCV group was older and had a lower platelet count and higher ARFI score than the other groups (P < 0.001). The NBNC group showed a higher body mass index and platelet count, a higher prevalence of pre-diagnosed non-HCC cancers (P < 0.001), especially breast cancer, and a lower prevalence of cirrhosis. Male gender, ARFI score, and HBV were independent predictors of HCC. The 5-year risk of HCC was 5.9% and 9.8% for those ARFI-graded with severe fibrosis and cirrhosis. ARFI alone had an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) of 0.742 for prediction of HCC in 5 years. AUROC increased to 0.828 after adding etiology, gender, age, and platelet score. No difference was found in mortality rate among the groups. CONCLUSION The HBV group showed a higher prevalence of HCC but lower comorbidity that made mortality similar among the groups. Those patients with ARFI-graded severe fibrosis or cirrhosis should receive regular surveillance."

In this review, applications of metformin are noticed based on the current evidence. Metformin commonly is used as an off-label drug in non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), but it worsens inflammation and should not be used for this purpose, according to the latest research.

Early diagnosis of lung cancer utilising low dose CT (LDCT) reduces mortality. The aim of this study is to analyse results of LDCT detection of lung cancer in an asbestos-exposed population over a 10-year period. Methods: The Asbestos Review Program has performed annual LDCT since 2012. Participants include former asbestos miners, former residents of the asbestos mining township, and anyone with >3 months cumulative occupational asbestos exposure. There are no age limits and any smoking status is accepted. All participants had a LDCT scan with annual health questionnaire and spirometry. Date of censoring 19 August 2022. Results: 11,834 LDCT scans were performed on 2131 individuals with a median age of 70 years (IQR 63-75), 1819 (85.4%) were male and 1357 (63.7%) were ever-smokers. 52 lung cancers were diagnosed in 50 participants (2.3% of the cohort). 4 lung cancers were identified by record linkage. Median age at diagnosis was 78.2 years (IQR 71.5-82.3). 40/48 (83.3%) had stage 1 disease and 37/48 (77.1%) participants underwent surgery or stereotactic radiotherapy with curative intent (3 participants with stage 1 disease had best supportive care due to advanced age and/or comorbidity). Lung cancer was prevalent in 28 (53.8%) individuals. Of the ever and current smokers ( n = 40), median pack year exposure was 30.5. Emphysema was visible on CT in 32.6% of participants; asbestosis in 38.5% and 67.3% had pleural plaques. At date of censoring, 29 (55.8%) of the cases were alive, with a median (IQR) survival of 707 (298-1495) days. Contribution to policy : This population has a high lung cancer risk. A controlled LDCT screening program is effective at diagnosing early-stage lung cancer in this population. Occupational exposure(s) should be considered when assessing risk for lung cancer, regardless of smoking status."

Low dose CT (LDCT) screening reduces lung cancer mortality. The aim of this study was to analyse results of LDCT screening for lung cancer in an asbestos-exposed population over a 10-year period. Methods: Participants included former asbestos miners, former residents of the asbestos mining township, and anyone with >3 months cumulative occupational asbestos exposure. There were no age limits and any smoking status was accepted. All participants had a LDCT scan with annual health questionnaire and spirometry. Date of censoring was 19 August 2022. Eligibility for lung cancer screening programs (LCSP) was analysed. Results: 11,834 LDCT scans were performed on 2131 individuals with a median age of 70 years (IQR 63-75), 1819 (85.4%) were male and 1357 (63.7%) were ever-smokers. 52 lung cancers were diagnosed in 50 participants (2.3% of the cohort). 4 lung cancers were identified by record linkage.

Dietary tryptophan ingested by the host enters the gut, where indole-like metabolites such as indole propionic acid (IPA) are produced under deamination by commensal bacteria. Here, we summarize the IPA-producing bacteria, dietary patterns on IPA content, and functional roles of IPA in various diseases. IPA can not only stimulate the expression of tight junction (TJ) proteins to enhance gut barrier function and inhibit the penetration of toxic factors, but also modulate the immune system to exert anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects to synergistically regulate body physiology. Moreover, IPA can act on target organs through blood circulation to form the gut–organ axis, which helps maintain systemic homeostasis. IPA shows great potential for the diagnosis and treatment of various clinical diseases, such as NAFLD, Alzheimer’s disease, and breast cancer. However, the therapeutic effect of IPA depends on dose, target organ, or time. In future studies, further work should be performed to explore the effects and mechanisms of IPA on host health and disease to further improve the existing treatment program."

Methods or Background: AI strategies in breast cancer screening should optimise the interaction between AI and human readers to maximise their combined benefit while ensuring patient safety and minimising clinical and operational risks. Large-scale retrospective data is used to evaluate a new paradigm of AI-supported reading. Instead of replacing a human reader, the AI serves as the second reader only if it agrees with the recall/no-recall decision of the first human reader. Otherwise, a second human reader makes an assessment, enacting standard human double reading. 280,594 participants from seven centres in two countries (UK, Hungary), and four hardware vendors (Giotto, Hologic, GE, Siemens) are included. Synthesised performance was measured via superiority/non-inferiority tests on cancer detection rate, recall rate, sensitivity, specificity, and positive predictive value. Workload was measured as arbitration rate and number of cases requiring a second human reading. Results or Findings: The novel synthesised workflow was found to be superior or non-inferior on all screening metrics, almost halving arbitration and reducing the number of cases requiring second human reading by up to 87.5% compared to human double reading. Conclusion: AI as a supporting reader adds a safety net in case of AI discordance while retaining screening performance of standard of care and drastically reducing workload."

Methods or Background: A commercially available AI system was employed as an extra reader (XR) in addition to standard double reading (DR) at a BCS provider in Hungary from Apr-Sept 2021. The XR workflow involved flagging cases the AI suggested to recall which DR did not recall, i.e. positive discordant cases, for arbitration by an experienced radiologist. Detected cancers were pathology-confirmed. Results or Findings: Standard DR for 3746 patients had an arbitration rate of 3.0% (114 patients), a recall rate of 6.7% (250 patients), and a cancer detection rate (CDR) of 12.5/1000 (47 cancer cases). Of the cases that were not recalled by DR, the AI flagged 396 cases to recommend recall (positive discordance rate 10.6%). Extra arbitration resulted in recalling 6 patients, all of whom were diagnosed with breast cancer. This equated to a total arbitration rate of 13.6% and 1.6/1000 increase in CDR (sum 14.1/1000). An exact simulation with a less sensitive AI operating point yielded a total arbitration rate of 5.3%, while still detecting 5 of 6 extra cancer cases. Conclusion: This real-world deployment of AI increased cancer detection rates without recalling extra false positives, indicating the effectiveness of AI as extra reader. Combining the XR workflow with workflows focused on workload savings will mitigate the increased arbitration rate and optimise clinical and operational benefits. The results provide important, real-world evidence showing the benefit of using an AI reader in breast cancer screening, paving the way for innovative workflows where synergy of humans and AI achieve optimal performance for patients."

Methods: Data from 382 patients who underwent robotic low anterior resection by four expert surgeons between January 2016 and June 2019 were included in the analysis. Operating time was used as a measure of operative difficulty. Univariate and multivariate mixed models were used to identify associations between baseline characteristics and operating time, with surgeon as a random effect, thereby controlling for variability in surgeon speed and proficiency. In an exploratory analysis, operative difficulty was defined as conversion to laparotomy, a positive margin or an incomplete mesorectum. Results: Median operating time was 4.28 h (range 1.95–11.33 h) but varied by surgeon from 3.45 h (1.95–6.10 h) to 5.93 h (3.33–11.33 h) (P < 0.001). Predictors of longer operating time in multivariate analysis were male sex, higher body mass index, neoadjuvant radiotherapy, low tumour height, greater sacral height and larger mesorectal area at the S5 vertebral level. Conversion occurred in two cases (0.5%), and incomplete mesorectum and positive margins were found in nine (2.4%) and 19 (5.0%) patients, respectively. Neoadjuvant radiotherapy and larger pelvic outlet were the only characteristics associated with the exploratory measure of difficulty. Conclusion: Predicting operative difficulty based on easy to identify, preoperative radiological and clinical variables is feasible in robotic anterior resection."

This study evaluates the effect of pre-operative clinical and anatomical parameters on operative difficulty in robotic low anterior resection performed by experienced surgeons in a high-volume colorectal cancer practice. Methods: Patients who underwent robotic low anterior resection by four expert surgeons between January 2016 and June 2019 were included. Baseline clinical data and preoperative pelvimetry measurements were collected. Increasing operative time was used as a measure of operative difficulty. Univariate and multivariate mixed models were used to identify significant predictors of increasing operative time, with surgeon as a random effect, thereby controlling for variability in surgeon speed and proficiency. A composite outcome of operative difficulty including conversion, positive margins and incomplete mesorectum was investigated in a secondary analysis. Results: This study enrolled 382 patients. Median (minimum-maximum) operative time was 4.28 (1.95-11.33) hours but varied by individual surgeon (3.45 (1.95-6.10), 3.83 (2.45-8.55), 5.40 (2.93-9.60) and 5.93 (3.33-11.33) hours, p < 0.001). Predictors of longer operative time in univariate analysis included male sex, body mass index, neoadjuvant radiotherapy, low tumor height, anterior tumor location, sacral height, pubic tubercle height and mesorectal area at the S5 vertebral level. All but anterior tumor location and pubic tubercle height remained significant on multivariate analysis. Conversion was performed in 2 cases (0.5%), whereas incomplete mesorectum and positive margins were found in 30 (7.9%) and 19 (5.0%) patients, respectively. Only pelvic outlet length was associated with this composite outcome. Conclusions: Herein we describe pre-operative clinical and anatomic predictors of operative difficulty in robotic low anterior resection for surgeons with different operative speed. Evaluating these parameters before surgery can help in surgical preparation, selection of appropriate teaching cases, hospital resource planning and management of patient expectations."

Recent experimental studies have shown that fructose not only serves as a substrate for, among others, intrahepatic lipid formation, but also has a signaling function. It is postulated that fructose 1-phosphate (F1-P) has evolved as a signaling molecule of abundancy that stimulates nutrient absorption, lipid storage, and reproduction.

Recent experimental studies have shown that fructose not only serves as a substrate for, among others, intrahepatic lipid formation, but also has a signaling function. It is postulated that fructose 1-phosphate (F1-P) has evolved as a signaling molecule of abundancy that stimulates nutrient absorption, lipid storage, and reproduction.

Methods: Using the Georgia Cancer Registry, 3084 patients with stage IIIB–IV primary BC (2013–2017) were identified. Cox proportional hazards regression was used to calculate the hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) comparing mortality among non-Hispanic Black (NHB) versus non-Hispanic White (NHW), residents of rural versus urban neighborhoods, and residents of low- versus high-SES neighborhoods by tumor, treatment, and patient characteristics. The mediating effects of specific characteristics on the association between race and BC mortality were estimated. Results: Among the study population, 41% were NHB, 21% resided in rural counties, and 72% resided in low SES neighborhoods. The authors observed mortality disparities by race (HR, 1.27; 95% CI, 1.13, 1.41) and rurality (HR, 1.14; 95% CI, 1.00, 1.30), but not by SES (HR, 1.04; 95% CI, 0.91, 1.19). In the stratified analyses, racial disparities were the most pronounced among women with HER2 overexpressing tumors (HR, 2.30; 95% CI, 1.53, 3.45). Residing in a rural county was associated with increased mortality among uninsured women (HR, 2.25; 95% CI, 1.31, 3.86), and the most pronounced SES disparities were among younger women (<40 years: HR, 1.46; 95% CI, 0.88, 2.42). Conclusions: There is considerable variation in racial, regional, and socioeconomic disparities in late-stage BC mortality by tumor, treatment, and patient characteristics."

Women residing in high-poverty or rural areas or who are non-Hispanic Black (NHB) experience higher rates of BC mortality relative to their counterparts. Although mortality disparities among late-stage BC patients are well-documented, few studies have examined the drivers of these disparities, which are likely multifactorial. We sought to identify tumor, treatment, and patient characteristics that may contribute to differences in BC mortality by race, rurality, and SES among women diagnosed with a first primary stage IIIB - IV BC in Georgia.Using the Georgia Cancer Registry, we identified 3085 patients with an initial diagnosis of stage IIIB-IV primary BC between January 2013 and December 2017. Cox proportional hazards regression was used to calculate the hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) to compare NHB vs. non-Hispanic White (NHW), rural vs. urban residents, and residents of low- vs. high-SES neighborhoods by tumor (stage, grade, ER status, and molecular subtype), treatment (surgery type, receipt of chemotherapy, radiation, hormonal, neoadjuvant, and immunotherapy), and patient (race, insurance, age group, marital status, region, SES) characteristics. Using an extension of the counterfactual framework, we estimated the mediating effects of subtype, stage, SES, rurality, and insurance on the association between race and BC mortality. Among the study population, 41% were NHB, 21% resided in rural counties, and 72% resided in low SES neighborhoods. Overall, we observed mortality disparities by race (HR=1.27, 95% CI: 1.13, 1.41) and rurality (HR=1.14, 95% CI: 1.00, 1.30), but not by SES (HR=1.04, 95% CI: 0.91, 1.19). In the stratified analyses, racial disparities were the most pronounced among women with HER2 overexpressing tumors (HR=2.30, 95% CI: 1.53, 3.45). Residing in a rural neighborhood was associated with increased mortality among uninsured women (HR=2.25, 95% CI: 1.31, 3.86) or receipt of breast-conserving surgery (HR=2.21, 95 CI%: 1.32, 3.71). The most pronounced socioeconomic disparities were among younger women (<40 years: HR=1.46, 95% CI: 0.88, 2.42) and patients who received neoadjuvant therapy (HR=1.44, 95% CI: 1.01, 2.05). The mediation analysis demonstrated that 48% of the effect between race and BC mortality was mediated by subtype.There is considerable variation in racial, regional, and socioeconomic disparities in metastatic BC mortality by tumor, treatment, and patient characteristics. For each, we've identified patient groups where disparities are most pronounced. Understanding specific barriers within these patient groups will inform future interventions aimed at reducing disparities in metastatic BC mortality."

The aim of this review is to summarize current evidence on the association of NAFLD and circulating sex hormones and to explore the pathogenesis of NAFLD within the context of (1) sex hormone changes during the reproductive, post-reproductive female life and beyond and (2) the in vitro and in vivo evidence on pharmacological modulation in women on menopausal hormone treatment (MHT) or endocrine therapy after breast cancer. The fluctuation in estrogen concentrations, the relative androgen excess, and the age-related reduction in sex hormone-binding globulin are related to increased NAFLD risk. Moreover, the peri-menopausal changes in body composition and insulin resistance might contribute to the increased NAFLD risk. Whether MHT prevents or improves NAFLD in this population remains an open question. Studies in women with breast cancer treated with tamoxifen or non-steroidal aromatase inhibitors point to their adverse effects on NAFLD development, although a more pronounced effect of tamoxifen is reported.

A literature survey demonstrated the broad spectrum of health benefits of baicalin such as antioxidant, anticancer, anti-inflammatory, antimicrobial, cardio-protective, hepatoprotective, renal protective, and neuroprotective properties. Baicalin is hydrolyzed to its metabolite baicalein by the action of gut microbiota, which is further reconverted to baicalin via phase 2 metabolism in the liver. Many studies have suggested that baicalin exhibits therapeutic potential against several types of hepatic disorders including hepatic fibrosis, xenobiotic-induced liver injury, fatty liver disease, viral hepatitis, cholestasis, ulcerative colitis, hepatocellular and colorectal cancer. During in vitro and in vivo examinations, it has been observed that baicalin showed a protective role against liver and gut-associated abnormalities by modifying several signaling pathways such as nuclear factor-kappa B, transforming growth factor beta 1/SMAD3, sirtuin 1, p38/mitogen-activated protein kinase/Janus kinase, and calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase kinaseβ/adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase/acetyl-coenzyme A carboxylase pathways. Furthermore, baicalin also regulates the expression of fibrotic genes such as smooth muscle actin, connective tissue growth factor, β- catenin, and inflammatory cytokines such as interferon gamma, interleukin-6 (IL- 6), tumor necrosis factor-alpha, and IL-1β, and attenuates the production of apoptotic proteins such as caspase-3, caspase-9 and B-cell lymphoma 2.

Methods: From October 2018 to April 2020, patients were retrospectively reviewed and divided into breast cancer non-NAC and NAC groups. The prevalence of chemotherapy-associated steatohepatitis was evaluated through quantitative MRI mDIXON-Quant examinations by using defined proton density fat fraction cutoffs of liver fat. The EAT volume was quantified on chest CT by semi-automatic volume analysis software. Bootstrap analysis was used in the breast cancer NAC group to test the significance of the mediating effect of liver fat content on EAT volume. Results: A total of 662 breast cancer patients (non-NAC group: 445 patients; NAC group: 217 patients) were included. The prevalence of chemotherapy-associated steatohepatitis in the NAC group was significantly higher than the prevalence of hepatic steatosis in the non-NAC group (42.8% vs. 33.3%, p < 0.001). EAT volume was measured in 561 of 662 breast cancer patients, and was significantly higher in the NAC group than in the non-NAC group (137.26 ± 53.48 mL vs. 125.14 ± 58.77 mL, p = 0.020). In the breast cancer NAC group, the indirect effect of liver fat content on EAT volume was 2.545 (p < 0.001), and the contribution rate to the effect was 69.1%. Conclusions: EAT volume was significantly higher in the BC-NAC group than in the BC-non-NAC group.

In the present study, we investigated the prognostic value of M2BP in patients with NAFLD. A total of 506 patients with biopsy-confirmed NAFLD from 2002 to 2013 were enrolled in this study in Japan. Three hundred fifty-three of these patients with NAFLD were available for follow-up for more than 100 days and showed no liver-related events at the time of entry. Liver-related events were defined as hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), decompensation, and gastroesophageal varices with variceal treatment. The mean follow-up duration of all the subjects was 2716 ± 1621 days (102–7483 days). Eighteen patients developed new liver-related events (HCC, 8; decompensation, 11; varices, 8). Nine patients developed cardiovascular disease (CVD), and 24 patients developed new cancers in other organs. The median serum M2BP level was 1.603 μg/mL, and we divided our cohort into two groups according to the serum M2BP level: M2BP low group (M2BP Low) and M2BP high group (M2BP Hi). The incidence of HCC was significantly higher in M2BP Hi (n = 8) than in M2BP Low (n = 0). The incidence of liver-related events was significantly higher in M2BP Hi (n = 16) than in M2BP Low (n = 2). The incidences of death, CVD events, and cancer in other organs were not different between the groups.

When the neither FLD group was the reference, multivariable-adjusted hazard ratios (95% confidence interval) for CRC were 1.16 (1.06-1.28) in the NAFLD only group, 1.18 (1.16-1.20) in the both FLD group, and 1.32 (1.28-1.35) in the MAFLD only group. The presence of advanced liver fibrosis further increased CRC risk in each FLD group. DISCUSSION: FLD was associated with a higher risk of CRC development. CRC risk was higher in the presence of MAFLD, especially when accompanied by liver fibrosis. behalf of The American College of Gastroenterology."

Silymarin, a flavonoid extracted from the Silybum marianum, exhibits antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities. Purpose: This study aimed to investigate the clinical efficacy of systemic administration of silymarin in management of chemotherapy induced hepatotoxicity in patients with non-metastatic breast cancer who received doxorubicin/cyclophosphamide-paclitaxel (AC-T) regimen. Material: In this randomized, triple blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial, 30 patients who received AC-T who fulfilled the inclusion criteria were randomly allocated to silymarin (n = 15) or placebo (n = 15) groups to receive oral silymarin 140 mg three times a day or placebo tablets, respectively. Fatty liver severity was assessed by liver ultrasound imaging and FibroScan® and also measurement of liver function tests before and after the intervention. Results: There was a non-significant trend toward more severe liver involvement in placebo group comparing to the silymarin group after intervention based on ultrasonography (p = 0.083). Besides, in silymarin group, hepatic involvement grade based on ultrasonography considerably reduced after intervention (p = 0.012). However, no difference was found between two groups based on FibroScan and liver function tests. Conclusion: Oral administration of silymarin could significantly reduce hepatotoxicity severity after 1 month of treatment in non-metastatic breast cancer patients treated with AC-T regimen."

Aims: The aim of this study was to assess whether the severity of fibrosis in NAFLD subjects was associated with extra-hepatic diseases based on noninvasive markers in a large population-based cohort. Methods: The study population included a cohort of 118,664 participants from the nationwide CONSTANCES cohort. After excluding individuals with excessive alcohol consumption and other causes of liver disease, 102,344 were included. The noninvasive diagnosis of NAFLD and fibrosis was performed using a combination of the Fatty Liver Index (FLI) and the Forns Index.

Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) or pancreatic disease (NAFPD) shares many risk factors with CRA that may have significant roles in its development; however, the relationship between CRA and NAFLD/NAFPD remains unclear. Methods: This cross-sectional study recruited 712 eligible participants without current drinking who had undergone total colonoscopy as part of a health checkup. These participants were classified into a CRA group (n = 236) and a control group (n = 439), which consisted of individuals without CRA and a history of polyp resection. NAFLD and NAFPD were diagnosed based on abdominal ultrasonography findings. Results: Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease was observed more frequently in individuals with CRA than in the control group (55.9% vs 41.6%, P < 0.01). There was no significant association between NAFPD and CRA; however, serum pancreatic amylase (P-amylase) levels were significantly lower in individuals with CRA. Although NAFLD was one of the factors increasing the presence of CRA (odds ratio [OR], 1.50; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.07–2.10), low P-amylase levels were significantly associated with the presence of CRA (OR, 1.73; 95% CI, 1.04–2.88) independent of age, sex, current smoking, obesity, metabolic alterations including insulin resistance, and NAFLD. Conclusions: Low serum P-amylase levels were a possible independent risk factor for CRA in the present study.

Even among patients with prognostically favorable tumors, disparities persist, suggesting clinical features do not fully account for mortality differences. Area-level factors (e.g., rurality) influence health outcomes and may explain spatial variation in mortality disparities. Rurality can impact access to and quality of care, and socioeconomic status. Georgia is an ideal place to study spatial heterogeneity in race disparities because of the diverse population (>30% Black), large number of counties (159), and pronounced disparities in breast cancer mortality in the Atlanta area. Methods: Race-specific standardized mortality ratios (SMRs) were calculated for each county in Georgia to account for sparsely populated areas and areas with high residential segregation. Observed deaths among women diagnosed with localized or regional breast cancer between 2005 and 2013 were obtained from the Georgia Cancer Registry. To ensure equal follow-up, only deaths within five years of diagnosis were included. Expected deaths were estimated using race-specific population counts, race-specific breast cancer incidence rates, and the pooled (Black and White) mortality rate among Georgia women, with indirect age adjustment (20-44, 45-54, 55+ years). Spatial smoothing methods, including adding neighboring data to meet a threshold and Bayesian models with conditionally autoregressive priors, were used to stabilize local estimates. Counties were classified by 2013 RUC codes (urban: 1-3, rural: 4-9). Results: A total of 3,235 breast cancer deaths were observed during the study period, with 42% among Black women. The median SMR was lower for White (0.8, IQR: 0.7, 1.1) than Black women (1.4, IQR: 1.1, 2.0). Among Black women only, median SMR was greater in rural (1.7, IQR: 1.1, 2.5) than urban counties (1.3, IQR: 1.1, 1.6). After sequentially adding neighboring data to meet a race-specific threshold of 30 observed deaths, smoothed median SMRs were 0.9 (IQR: 0.8, 0.9) and 1.4 (IQR: 1.2, 1.6) for White and Black women, respectively. For Black women, median SMR was attenuated in rural counties (1.4, IQR: 1.2, 1.7) but unchanged in urban counties (1.3, IQR: 1.2, 1.5). The greatest SMRs for Black women were observed in urban counties comprising the Atlanta area and rural southeast Georgia. For example, Fulton County SMRs were 1.6 and 0.7, for Black and White women, respectively. Highest SMRs for White women were observed in southwest Georgia, but were similar to SMRs among Black women in this region. The spatial distribution of SMRs using same neighbor smoothing and Bayesian models were similar. Conclusion: Breast cancer mortality race disparities vary widely across Georgia. These results highlight specific areas for public health intervention, especially among Black women. This work presents a potential mechanism to monitor trends in small area cancer mortality race disparities over time. Future work will model the impact of area-level factors on the disparity magnitude."

We precisely report changes in lipoprotein metabolism before and after tamoxifen discontinuation because there have been few reports of it. Case presentation: 47-year-old premenopausal woman with dyslipidemia, type 2 diabetes, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease and chronic kidney disease was prescribed tamoxifen as adjuvant therapy after operation of breast cancer. She experienced severe tamoxifen-induced hypertriglyceridemia several months after dosing tamoxifen. Before cessation of tamoxifen, lipoprotein fraction test revealed marked stagnation of VLDL and IDL metabolisms, resulting in severe hypertriglyceridemia (serum triglyceride level was 1881 mg/dL). Seven days after tamoxifen withdrawal, lipoprotein fraction test showed that the metabolisms of endogenous lipoproteins were changed drastically. Conclusions: From these results, we confirmed that tamoxifen certainly changes lipoprotein metabolism through suppression of post-heparin lipolytic activity. It is very important to evaluate the balance between benefit and risk before dosing tamoxifen and survey lipid profiles constantly during treatment to avoid life-threatening complication when prescription of tamoxifen is planned."

However, TAM has been proved to affect serum lipid profiles and cause fatty liver disease. The study aimed to compare the effects of TAM and TOR on fatty liver development and lipid profiles. Methods: This study performed a retrospective analysis of 308 SERMs-treated early breast cancer patients who were matched 1:1 based on propensity scores. The follow-up period was 3 years. The primary outcomes were fatty liver detected by ultrasonography or computed tomography (CT), variation in fibrosis indexes, and serum lipid profiles change. Results: The cumulative incidence rate of new-onset fatty liver was higher in the TAM group than in the TOR group (113.2 vs. 67.2 per 1000 person-years, p < 0.001), and more severe fatty livers occurred in the TAM group (25.5 vs. 7.5 per 1000 person-years, p = 0.003). According to the Kaplan-Meier curves, TAM significantly increased the risk of new-onset fatty liver (25.97% vs. 17.53%, p = 0.0243) and the severe fatty liver (5.84% vs. 1.95%, p = 0.0429). TOR decreased the risk of new-onset fatty liver by 45% (hazard ratio = 0.55, p = 0.020) and showed lower fibrotic burden, independent of obesity, lipid, and liver enzyme levels. TOR increased triglycerides less than TAM, and TOR increased high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, while TAM did the opposite. No significant differences in total cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol are observed between the two groups. Conclusions: TAM treatment is significantly associated with more severe fatty liver disease and liver fibrosis, while TOR is associated with an overall improvement in lipid profiles, which supports continuous monitoring of liver imaging and serum lipid levels during SERM treatment."

We investigated whether fatty liver is a risk factor for changes in breast density over ~ 4 years of follow-up in pre- and postmenopausal women. Methods: This study included 74,781 middle-aged Korean women with mammographically determined dense breasts at baseline. Changes in dense breasts were identified by more screening mammograms during follow-up. Hepatic steatosis (HS) was measured using ultrasonography. Flexible parametric proportional hazards models were used to determine the adjusted hazard ratios (aHRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs), and a Weibull accelerated failure time model (AFT) was used to determine the time ratios (TRs) and 95% CIs. Results: During a median follow-up of 4.1 years, 4022 women experienced resolution of the dense breasts. The association between HS and dense breast resolution differed by the menopause status (P for interaction < 0.001). After adjusting for body mass index and other covariates, the aHRs (95% CI) for dense breast resolution comparing HS to non-HS were 0.81 (0.70–0.93) in postmenopausal women, while the association was converse in premenopausal women with the corresponding HRs of 1.30 (1.18–1.43). As an alternative approach, the multivariable-adjusted TR (95% CI) for dense breast survival comparing HS to non-HS were 0.81 (0.75–0.87) and 1.19 (1.06–1.33) in premenopausal and postmenopausal women, respectively. Conclusion: The association between HS and changes in dense breasts differed with the menopause status.

We hypothesized that patients with CAM, treated with multimodality therapy, would have improved overall survival (OS) versus patients with distant metastatic disease (M1) and similar OS to those with locally advanced breast cancer (LABC). Methods: Using the NCDB (2004–2016), we categorized adult patients with node-positive breast cancer into three study groups: LABC, CAM, and M1. Kaplan-Meier curves were used to visualize the unadjusted OS. Cox proportional hazards models were used to estimate the association of study group with OS. Results: A total of 94,487 patients were identified: 122 with CAM, 12,325 with LABC, and 82,040 with M1 (median follow-up 63.6 months). LABC and CAM patients had similar histology and rates of chemotherapy and endocrine therapy receipt. However, the CAM group had significantly larger tumors, more estrogen-receptor expression, higher T-stage, and more mastectomies than the LABC group. Compared with M1 patients, CAM patients were more likely to have grade 3 and cT4 tumors. Patients with CAM and LABC had similar 5-year unadjusted OS and significantly improved OS vs M1 patients. After adjustment, LABC and CAM patients continued to have similar OS and better OS vs M1 patients. Conclusions: CAM patients who receive multi-modal therapy with curative intent may have OS more comparable to LABC patients than M1 patients. Out data support a reevaluation of whether CAM should remain classified as M1, as N3 may better reflect disease prognosis and treatment goals."

In prior studies, many patients with CAM have had dermal involvement, suggesting contiguous, a locoregional origin via dermal lymphatic involvement. Additional studies have shown CAM to be associated with aberrant lymphatic drainage following prior axillary surgery, prompting many centers to approach CAM with curative intent. We hypothesized that patients with isolated CAM treated with multimodal therapy with curative intent would have better overall survival (OS) than patients with distant metastatic disease (M1) and may be more similar to those with locally advanced breast cancer (LABC). Methods: Using the National Cancer Database (2004-2015), we identified adult patients with node-positive breast cancer who were categorized into 3 study groups: patients with 1) LABC (cN2b/3a-c, M0, who completed surgery and radiation), 2) CAM (cM1 with metastatic site classified as ""distant lymph node(s): cervical, contralateral or bilateral axillary and/or internal mammary, or other distant lymph nodes,"" who completed surgery and radiation, including resection of distant lymph nodes), and 3) M1 (metastatic disease at any site(s) other than ""distant lymph node(s)."" Node-positive patients who could not be categorized into 1 of these 3 groups were excluded. A Kaplan-Meier curve was used to visualize the unadjusted OS. A Cox proportional hazards model was used to estimate the association of study group with OS after adjusting for covariates. Results: There were 94,487 patients identified with LABC (n=12,325), CAM (n=122), and M1 (n=82,040). Median follow-up was 63.6 months (95% CI 63.0-64.2). Progressively advanced disease (LABC > CAM > M1) was associated with progressively older age, (median ages 55, 57, and 62, respectively, p<0.001). LABC and CAM patients had many similarities, including histology (ductal 75.7% vs. 80.3%), grade (grade 3, 59.0% vs. 63.1%), tumor size (median 3.70 vs. 3.95 cm), and receipt of adjuvant chemotherapy (94.6% vs. 95.1%) and endocrine therapy (55.9% vs. 55.7%). However, the CAM group had significantly more advanced T-stage (cT4, 22.4% vs. 41.0%), and underwent mastectomy more frequently (78.2% vs. 84.4%) than the LABC group. When compared to M1 patients, CAM patients were more likely to have grade 3 and cT4 tumors. Patients with CAM and LABC had similar 5-year unadjusted OS (58.2% [95% CI 46.7-68.1] vs. 64.7% [63.7-65.7]) that was also significantly better than that of M1 patients (21.6% [21.3-22.0]) (Figure). After adjustment, LABC and CAM patients had improved, but similar OS as compared to M1 patients (LABC: HR 0.48, 95%CI 0.46-0.50; CAM: HR 0.44 95%CI 0.33-0.61). Conclusions: Patients with CAM without evidence of distant disease who are treated with multimodal therapy and curative intent have comparable OS to patients with locally advanced, M0 disease. These data support that it may be more appropriate to classify CAM as AJCC Clinical Prognostic Stage III, rather than M1 disease, to more accurately reflect the prognosis of this unique patient population."

The aim of this study was to identify the risk and timing of the more common GI malignancies, colorectal and pancreatic cancer, to aid in optimizing potential posttransplant screening practices. Approach and Results: Data from the United Network for Organ Sharing database of all adult liver-transplant recipients from 1997 to 2017 were analyzed and a comparison made with cancer incidence from general population data using Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results data. Of 866 de novo GI malignancies, 405 colorectal and 216 pancreas were identified. The highest cumulative incidence for colorectal cancer occurred in recipients with primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC), recipients over the age of 50 with non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC)/cholangiocarcinoma (CCA), and females >50 years with alcohol-associated liver disease and HCC/CCA, with risk increasing above the general population within 5 years of transplant. Patients with PSC and HCC/CCA or NASH and HCC/CCA have the highest cumulative incidence of pancreatic cancer also rising within 5 years following transplant, with those patients >50 years old conferring the highest risk. Conclusions: These data identify a high-risk cohort that warrants consideration for intensified individualized screening practices for colorectal cancer after liver transplantation. In addition to recipients with PSC, further study of recipients with NASH and HCC/CCA and females with alcohol-associated liver disease and HCC/CCA may be better tailored to colorectal cancer screening ideals. Higher-risk patient populations for pancreatic cancer (PSC and NASH with HCC/CCA) would benefit from further study to determine potential screening practices.

The impacts of bariatric surgery on cancer risk in NAFLD patients are unknown. We investigated the effect of bariatric surgery on cancer risk in patients with NAFLD and severe obesity using the MarketScan database. Methods: We conducted a retrospective cohort study of 18 to 64 years old newly diagnosed NAFLD patients with severe obesity between 2007 and 2017. We used Cox proportional hazard models to examine the association between bariatric surgery, modeled as a time-varying covariate, and the risks of any cancer and obesity-related cancer, while accounting for confounding using inverse probability of treatment weighting (IPTW). Results: A total of 98,090 patients were included in the study, 33,435 (34.1%) received bariatric surgery. In those without surgery, 1898 incident cases of cancer occurred over 115,890.11 person-years of follow-up, compared with 925 cancer cases over 67,389.82 person-years among surgery patients (crude rate ratio, 0.84; 95% CI, 0.77- 0.91). The IPTW-adjusted risk of any cancer and obesity-related cancer was reduced by 18% (hazard ratio, 0.82; 95% CI, 0.76–0.89) and 25% (hazard ratio, 0.65; 95% CI, 0.56–0.75), respectively, in patients with versus without bariatric surgery. The adjusted risks of any cancer and obesity-related cancer were significantly lower in cirrhotic versus non-cirrhotic patients who underwent surgery. In cancer-specific models, bariatric surgery was associated with significant risk reductions for colorectal, pancreatic, endometrial, thyroid cancers, hepatocellular carcinoma, and multiple myeloma. Conclusion: Bariatric surgery was associated with significant reductions in the risks of any cancer and obesity-related cancer in NAFLD patients with severe obesity."

We noticed an increased risk of bleeding due to both entities present together. Our aim is to focus on treatment and possible prevention of gastrointestinal bleeding in patients with preexisting portal hypertensive gastropathy undergoing radiation therapy for newly diagnosed cancer. CASE DESCRIPTION/METHODS: We have a 73-year-old female with past medical history of insulin dependent diabetes mellitus, hypertension, liver Cirrhosis secondary to NAFLD, pancreatic cancer diagnosed 8 months prior to presentation with liver metastasis, completed chemotherapy and radiation therapy 3 months ago presented to the hospital with bright red blood in stool and 3 episodes of hematemesis quantified as a cupful each time starting on the day of presentation. Labs on admission showed hemoglobin 6.5 g/dL, platelet count 127 k/uL. Rest of the labs were unremarkable. MELD score 9. During hospitalization, patient underwent series of endoscopies due to persistent bleeding. Initial EGD showed nonbleeding grade 1 esophageal varices, portal hypertensive gastropathy, diffuse active oozing noted in the distal stomach not amenable to endoscopic techniques. Patient did not tolerate beta blocker therapy so TIPS was considered. Portal pressures measured by hepatic vein catheterization showed mildly elevated pressures. Repeat endoscopy showed diffuse erythematous, edematous, congested mucosa with diffusely oozing blood in the antrum consistent with hemorrhagic gastritis. This confirmed that the patient had damage related to radiation along with preexisting portal hypertensive gastropathy.Patient was started on sucralfate, octreotide injections, pantoprazole. Bleeding subsequently improved. DISCUSSION: The most common complications of portal hypertension leading to upper GI bleeding are Varices and portal hypertensive gastropathy (PHG).Radiation induced hemorrhagic gastritis is an unusual lethal complication post radiation. Patients with pre existing portal hypertensive gastropathy have very friable mucosa that can easily bleed after radiation for cancer treatment. Several therapies like prednisolone, argon plasma coagulation (APC), laser coagulation have been proposed. There are no set guidelines which can appropriately treat radiation gastritis. In these patients, if radiation therapy is indicated either for hepatic or gastrointestinal malignancy, it is suggested to premedicate with proton pump inhibitors or sucralfate. (Figure Presented)."

We analyzed data from a large prospective cohort study to determine the relationship between NAFLD and development of cancers in men. Methods: We collected data from the Kailuan cohort, a community-based cohort of 54,187 adult men in China, from June 2006 through October 2007. NAFLD was diagnosed by ultrasonography after excluding other causes related to chronic liver disease. Fine and Gray competing risk regression model was used to evaluate associations between NAFLD (without cirrhosis) and cancers. Results: The prevalence of NAFLD was 32.3%. NAFLD was associated with increased risk of all cancers (hazard ratio [HR], 1.22; 95% CI, 1.10–1.36; P = .0001), thyroid cancer (HR, 2.79; 95% CI, 1.25–6.21; P = .01), and lung cancer (HR, 1.23; 95% CI, 1.02–1.49; P = .03). The association between NAFLD and risk of thyroid cancer increased with level of alanine aminotransferase (ALT). In men with NAFLD, level of ALT 80 U/L or more was associated with hepatocellular carcinoma (HR, 8.08; 95% CI, 2.46–26.56; P = .0006). NAFLD increased risk of colorectal cancer (HR, 1.96; 95% CI, 1.17–3.27) and lung cancer (HR, 1.38; 95% CI, 1.03–1.84) only in smokers. An association between NAFLD and kidney cancer (HR, 1.57; 95% CI, 1.03–2.40) was only observed in men without diabetes. Conclusions: A cohort study from China found that men with NAFLD have a higher risk of extrahepatic cancers, including thyroid and lung cancer. In men with NAFLD, higher levels of ALT were associated with higher risk of thyroid and hepatocellular cancer. NAFLD increased risk of colorectal and lung cancer only in smokers, and increased risk of kidney cancer in men without diabetes."

Many studies have shown that baicalin, an extract from Scutellaria baicalensis Georgi, exerts various protective effects on liver and gut diseases. Baicalin plays a therapeutic role mainly by mediating downstream apoptosis and immune response pathways induced by upstream oxidative stress and inflammation. During oxidative stress regulation, PI3K/Akt/NRF2, Keap-1, NF-κB and HO-1 are key factors associated with the healing effects of baicalin on NAFLD/NASH, ulcerative colitis and cholestasis. In the inflammatory response, IL-6, IL-1β, TNF-α, MIP-2 and MIP-1α are involved in the alleviation of NAFLD/NASH, cholestasis and liver fibrosis by baicalin, as are TGF-β1/Smads, STAT3 and NF-κB. Regarding the apoptosis pathway, Bax, Bcl-2, Caspase-3 and Caspase-9 are key factors related to the suppression of hepatocellular carcinoma and attenuation of liver injury and colorectal cancer. In addition to immune regulation, PD-1/PDL-1 and TLR4-NF-κB are correlated with the alleviation of hepatocellular carcinoma, ulcerative colitis and colorectal cancer by baicalin.

We aim to evaluate the association between NAFLD and cardiovascular disease (CVD), stroke and cerebrovascular disease, and extrahepatic cancers. Methods: We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Cochrane Systematic Review Database from January 1, 2000 to July 1, 2019 to identify peer-reviewed English language literature using predefined keywords for NAFLD, CVD, stroke and cerebrovascular disease, and extrahepatic cancers among adults. Two reviewers independently selected studies for inclusion. Measures of association between NAFLD and CVD, stroke and cerebrovascular disease, and extrahepatic cancers were extracted. Quality assessed using Newcastle-Ottawa scale and Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE). Results: Thirty studies were included evaluating CVD, 16 studies evaluating stroke or cerebrovascular disease, and 13 studies evaluating extrahepatic cancers. On pooled meta-analysis assessment, NAFLD was associated with increased risk of CVD (risk ratio [RR]: 1.78; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.52–2.08) and stroke or cerebrovascular disease (RR: 2.08, 95% CI: 1.72–2.51). Significant heterogeneity in assessing extrahepatic cancers prevented applying meta-analysis methods, but NAFLD seemed to be associated with increased risk of breast and colorectal cancers.

We aim to systematically evaluate the association between NAFLD and CVD, stroke or cerebrovascular disease, and extra-hepatic cancers. Methods: We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Systematic Review Database from January 1, 2000 to July 1, 2019 using predefined keywords to identify relevant studies. Data from selected studies were extracted and meta-analysis was performed. Quality of included studies was assessed using Newcastle-Ottawa scale and Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE). Heterogeneity was assessed using 2 and I2 tests with I2>50% indicating significant heterogeneity between studies. Potential publication bias was assessed using funnel plots. Analyses were performed using Review Manager (RevMan). Statistical significance was established with p<0.05. Results: A total of 30 studies were included for evaluating CVD, 16 studies for evaluating stroke or cerebrovascular disease, and 13 studies for evaluating extrahepatic cancers.

Areas covered: This review focuses on the roles that the oral–gut or the oral–gut–liver axis play in the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease, colorectal cancer, metabolic fatty liver disease, and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis. The discussion will begin with clinical data, including data from preclinical animal models, to elucidate mechanisms. We will also discuss ways to target oral dysbiosis and oral inflammation to treat gastrointestinal and liver diseases. Expert opinion: Several studies have demonstrated that oral pathobionts can translocate to the gastrointestinal tract where they contribute to inflammation and tumorigenesis. Furthermore, oral bacteria that migrate to the gastrointestinal tract can disseminate to the liver and cause hepatic disease. Thus, oral bacteria that ectopically colonize the intestine may serve as biomarkers for gastrointestinal and liver diseases.

Cox regression models were used for analysis. Results: Among the subjects, 51.8% (n = 3,606,079) were premenopausal women. In the premenopausal and postmenopausal groups, 32,145 (0.89%) and 28,103 (0.82%) women developed breast cancer, respectively (median follow-up, 7.02 years; interquartile range, 6.39-7.39 years). Mean FLI and standard deviation were lower in premenopausal women (11.24 ± 14.72 vs. 23.88 ± 19.54, P < .0001). Three groups were formed according to FLI: < 30 (n = 5,693,730, 80.81%), 30-60 (n = 1,031,025, 14.63%), and ≥ 60 (n = 321,398, 4.56%). FLIs of 30-60 and ≥ 60 were significantly associated with increased breast cancer risk in postmenopausal women (hazard ratio, 1.07; 95% confidence interval, 1.04-1.11; and hazard ratio, 1.11; 95% confidence interval, 1.05-1.17, respectively). No association was found in premenopausal women. Conclusion: High FLI, an indicator of NAFLD, could predict breast cancer in postmenopausal women."

The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of tamoxifen on fatty change of liver over time and also the impact of fatty liver on the prognosis of patients with breast cancer. Methods: This was a single-center, retrospective study of patients who were diagnosed with primary breast cancer from January 2007 to July 2017. 911 consecutive patients were classified into three groups according to treatment method: tamoxifen group, aromatase inhibitor (AI) group, and control group. Results: Median treatment duration was 49 months (interquartile range, IQR; 32-58) and median observational period was 85 months (IQR; 50-118). Long-term use of tamoxifen significantly aggravated fatty liver status compared to AI or control groups [hazard ratio (HR): 1.598, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.173-2.177, P = 0.003] after adjusting other factors.

Our goal is to explore the relationship between NAFLD and colorectal cancer (CRC) and to analyze potential indicators for screening CRC in NAFLD based on clinical big data. Methods: Demographic information and routine clinical indicators were extracted from Xiangya Medical Big Data Platform. 35,610 NAFLD cases without CRC (as group NAFLD-CRC), 306 NAFLD cases with CRC (as group NAFLD-NonCRC) and 10,477 CRC cases without NAFLD were selected and evaluated. The CRC incidence was compared between NAFLD population and general population by Chi-square test. Independent sample t-test was used to find differences of age, gender and routine clinical indicators in pairwise comparisons of NAFLD-CRC, NAFLD-NonCRC and nonNAFLD-CRC. Results: NAFLD population had a higher CRC incidence than general population (7.779‰ vs 3.763‰, P < 0.001). Average age of NAFLD-CRC (58.79 ± 12.353) or nonNAFLD-CRC (59.26 ± 13.156) was significantly higher than NAFLD-nonCRC (54.15 ± 14.167, p < 0.001). But age had no significant difference between NAFLD-CRC and nonNAFLD-CRC (P > 0.05). There was no different gender distribution for three groups (P > 0.05). NAFLD-CRC had lower anaemia-related routine clinical indicators such as decrease of red blood cell count, mean hemoglobin content and hemoglobin than NAFLD-nonCRC (P < 0.05 for all). Anemia of NAFLD-CRC was typical but it might be slighter than nonNAFLD-CRC. More interestingly, NAFLD-CRC had distinct characteristics of leukocyte system such as lower white blood cell count (WBC) and neutrophil count (NEU_C) and higher basophil percentage (BAS_Per) than nonNAFLD-CRC and NAFLD-nonCRC (P < 0.05 for all). Compared with NAFLD-nonCRC, the change of WBC, BAS_Per and NEU_C in NAFLD-CRC was different from that in nonNAFLD-CRC. In addition, NAFLD-CRC had a higher level of low density lipoprotein (LDL) and high density lipoprotein (HDL), lower level of triglyceride (TG) and Albumin-to-globulin ratio (A/G) than NFLD-nonCRC (P < 0.05 for all). Conclusions: NAFLD is associated with a high incidence of CRC. Age is an important factor for CRC and the CRC incidence increases with age. Anemia-related blood routine clinical indicators, leukocyte system and blood lipid indicators may be more important variables for identifying CRC in NAFLD. So blood routine test and liver function/blood lipid test are valuable for screening CRC in NAFLD."

Fixed- and random-effect meta-analyses were conducted according to the heterogeneity of enrolled studies. Subgroup analyses were based on whether NAFLD was induced by Selective-estrogen receptor modulator (SERM) administration. Results: Six cohorts from five studies including 935 NAFLD and 2102 non-NAFLD patients were enrolled. NAFLD was significantly associated with advanced age (p< 0.001), obesity (p< 0.001), lymph node metastasis (p = 0.003), hormone receptor positivity (p < 0.001) and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 positivity (p = 0.008).

Maternal ingestion of the diet during pregnancy has also been shown to have positive effects on infants and children. [Pediatr Ann. 2019;48(6):e220-e225.]."
370,1462,1462,PREVALENCE OF UPPER GASTROINTESTINAL NEOPLASIA IN PATIENTS WITH COMPENSATED ADVANCED CHRONIC LIVER DISEASE IN COMPARISON TO A HEALTHY SCREENING POPULATION,"Morais, R.J.; Marques, M.; Gaspar, R.; Alves, R.; Silva, J.; Dias, E.; Santos-Antunes, J.; Pereira, P.; Lopes, S.; Cardoso, H.; Liberal, R.; Macedo, G.",10.1016/S0016-5085(19)38292-7,"Introduction: The Baveno VI and the expanded Baveno VI criteria were proposed to help identify patients who could safely avoid screening esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) for clinically significant varices among patients with compensated advanced chronic liver disease (cACLD). Although several studies have meanwhile validated those criteria, all fail to acknowledge the possible role of the avoided EGD for the same time screening of upper GI neoplasia in cACLD population. Liver diseases are associated with an increased risk of extra-hepatic malignancies. However, there is no data on the epidemiology of upper GI neoplasia in patients with cACLD. Aims: We aimed to systematically evaluate the presence, type and pathological characteristics of upper GI neoplasia in patients with cACLD who underwent screening EGD in comparison to a healthy screening population in a country with intermediate gastric cancer risk and high Helicobacter pylori prevalence. Methods: This retrospective case-control study enrolled all asymptomatic cACLD patients who underwent EGD for varices screening from January 2008 to June 2018. Cases were matched with asymptomatic healthy individuals who underwent EGD for gastric cancer screening at the same time as colonoscopy performed for colorectal cancer screening. Results: We included 1974 subjects (610 patients, 1364 controls), 46.3% male, with a median age of 58 (50-66) years. Besides a male predominance in cases (69.0% vs. 45.6%, p<0.001), no other demographic characteristic differed between groups. The leading aetiology of ACLD was alcoholic liver disease (53.3%), followed by chronic hepatitis C (16.2%), and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (7.9%). Of the 610 patients with cACLD, 1 (0.2%) had squamous-cell esophageal carcinoma, 13 (2.1%) gastric neoplasia [gastric cancer, n=10; high-grade dysplasia (HGD),n=2; low-grade dysplasia (LGD),n=1], 1 (0.2%) duodenal neoplasia (LGD) and 3 (0.5%) ampullary lesions (LGD). Compared to controls, cACLD patients had a higher prevalence of gastric neoplasia [2.1% vs. 1%, p=0.044; gastric cancer 1.6% vs. 0.8%, p=0.08) and ampullary lesions (0.5% vs. 0%,p=0.01). The prevalence of Helicobacter pylori infection was lower in patients compared to controls (36.2% vs. 47.2%, p=0.004). In the 18 cACLD patients in whom were detected neoplastic lesions, 9 (50%) were diagnosed on the initial screening endoscopy. Five of these patients had transient elastography <20 kPA and platelet count >150000 before EGD. Conclusion: The prevalence of esophagogastroduodenal neoplastic lesions, particularly gastric neoplasia, in cACLD patients who underwent screening EGD is significant, being higher compared to controls. EGD should therefore still be considered in patients with ACLD from countries with intermediate gastric cancer risk, independent of the Baveno criteria."

However, no previous studies have examined the relationship between serum Zn levels and the incidence of hepatic and extra-hepatic malignancies in patients with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). The aim of this study was to investigate the prognosis based on serum Zn levels in biopsy-proven NAFLD patients. Method: A total of 179 NAFLD patients who underwent liver biopsy were enrolled. Firstly, we identified laboratory markers and pathological findings associated with serum Zn levels. Secondary, we assessed the factors, including serum Zn levels, associated with the incidence of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and extra-hepatic malignancies. Results: Zn level significantly decreased along with progression of hepatic fibrosis (p = 0.012), but there were no significant differences among inflammatory grades. Zn levels were most strongly correlated with albumin levels (r = 0.432, P < 0.001). In addition, Zn levels were significantly correlated with homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) (r = – 0.300, P < 0.001) and branched chain amino acid/tyrosine molar ratio (BTR) (r = 0.337, P < 0.001). On the other hand, HCC and extra-hepatic malignancies developed in 7 (3.9%) and 10 (5.6%) during follow-up period (median 7.9 years), respectively. When Zn deficiency was defined as serum level < 70 μg/dL, 39 of our patients (21.8%) were classified as Zn-deficient. Patients with Zn deficiency had significantly higher incidental rate of extra-hepatic malignancies (p = 0.026). The majority of extrahepatic malignancies in this patients’ population were breast cancer and digestive malignancies. Conversely, serum Zn levels were not able to predict hepatocarcinogenesis (p = 0.141). Multiple logistic regression analyses revealed the following risk factors associated with the incidence of extra-hepatic malignancies: serum Zn level < 70 μg/dL (hazard ratio [HR] 3.504, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.010-12.157, P = 0.048) and liver inflammation (A2-3) (HR 3.445, 95% CI 0.886-13.395, P = 0.074). Conclusion: The progression of liver fibrosis was associated with lower serum Zn levels, and serum Zn levels were correlated with nutrition markers and insulin resistance in biopsy-proven NAFLD patients.

Considering the fact that diabetes millitus is a key risk factor for almost all age-related diseases, the extensive protective roles of incretin in chronic diseases have received great attention. Based on the evidence from animal experiments, where incretin can protect against the pathophysiological processes of neurodegenerative diseases, clinical trials for the treatments of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and Parkinson’s disease (PD) patients are currently ongoing. Moreover, the protective effect of incretin on heart has been observed in cardiac myocytes, smooth muscle cells and endothelial cells of vessels. Meanwhile, incretin can also inhibit the proliferation of aortic vascular smooth muscle cells, which can induce atherosclerogenesis. Incretin is also beneficial for diabetic microvascular complications, including nephropathy, retinopathy and gastric ulcer, as well as the hepatic-related diseases such as NAFLD and NASH.

Drug therapy using incretin has become a new strategy for diabetic treatments due to its significant effects on improving insulin receptors and promoting insulinotropic secretion. Considering the fact that diabetes millitus is a key risk factor for almost all age-related diseases, the extensive protective roles of incretin in chronic diseases have received great attention. Based on the evidence from animal experiments, where incretin can protect against the pathophysiological processes of neurodegenerative diseases, clinical trials for the treatments of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Parkinson's disease (PD) patients are currently ongoing. Moreover, the protective effect of incretin on heart has been observed in cardiac myocytes, smooth muscle cells and endothelial cells of vessels. Meanwhile, incretin can also inhibit the proliferation of aortic vascular smooth muscle cells, which can induce atherosclerogenesis. Incretin is also beneficial for diabetic microvascular complications, including nephropathy, retinopathy and gastric ulcer, as well as the hepatic-related diseases such as NAFLD and NASH. Besides, the anti-tumor properties of incretin have been proven in diverse cancers including ovarian cancer, pancreas cancer, prostate cancer and breast cancer. epub@benthamscience.net."

It remains unclear whether there are similar causal effects of obesity traits on other non-communicable diseases. Also, it is largely unexplored whether there are any sex-specific differences in the causal effects of obesity traits on cardiometabolic diseases and other leading causes of death. We constructed sex-specific genetic risk scores (GRS) for three obesity traits; body mass index (BMI), waist-hip ratio (WHR), and WHR adjusted for BMI, including 565, 324, and 337 genetic variants, respectively. These GRSs were then used as instrumental variables to assess associations between the obesity traits and leading causes of mortality in the UK Biobank using Mendelian randomization. We also investigated associations with potential mediators, including smoking, glycemic and blood pressure traits. Sex-differences were subsequently assessed by Cochran’s Q-test (Phet). A Mendelian randomization analysis of 228,466 women and 195,041 men showed that obesity causes coronary artery disease, stroke (particularly ischemic), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, lung cancer, type 2 and 1 diabetes mellitus, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, chronic liver disease, and acute and chronic renal failure. Higher BMI led to higher risk of type 2 diabetes in women than in men (Phet = 1.4×10−5). Waist-hip-ratio led to a higher risk of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (Phet = 3.7×10−6) and higher risk of chronic renal failure (Phet = 1.0×10−4) in men than women. Obesity traits have an etiological role in the majority of the leading global causes of death. Sex differences exist in the effects of obesity traits on risk of type 2 diabetes, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and renal failure, which may have downstream implications for public health."

Methods: Retrospective analysis of patients with CLM prior resection. Preoperative assessment of liver function by LiMAx test. Histologic staging of resected tumor-free liver tissue. Analysis of 12-month history of chemotherapy prior surgery including the regime, the number of cycles and the therapy-free interval. Results: A total of 204 patients were analyzed. The majority (n=127; 62 %) had received previous chemotherapy. Impaired LiMAx results were determined in 49% of patients after chemotherapy. The extent of LiMAx impairment was dependent on number of oxaliplatin cycles, therapy-free interval and obesity in multivariate analysis. Patients with impaired LiMAx showed regeneration during chemotherapy cessation. Chemotherapy increased the incidence of steatosis (>33%; 29 vs. 17%) as well as of mild fibrosis (62 vs. 45%). The LiMAx was markedly decreased in steatosis (335 vs. 375 μg/kg/h, P=0.024), steatohepatitis (292 vs. 372 μg/kg/h, P=0.003), and severe fibrosis (318 vs. 395 μg/kg/h, P=0.001).

Materials and Methods: A retrospective analysis of 253 patients with early breast cancer without baseline NAFLD and treated with nonsteroidal aromatase inhibitors was performed. Among them, 220 patients were matched for sex, age, and menstruation status with healthy patients, and the prevalence of NAFLD was compared. NAFLD was determined by hepatic steatosis index in the absence of other known liver diseases. The presence of significant liver fibrosis in patients with NAFLD was determined noninvasively by AST-platelet ratio index, FIB-4 score, and NAFLD fibrosis score (NFS). Results: Postmenopausal patients with breast cancer undergoing treatment with aromatase inhibitors had higher prevalence of NAFLD independent of body mass index (BMI) and underlying diabetes mellitus (DM). Although the aromatase inhibitor group showed higher fibrotic burden by NFS, independent of BMI and DM, the proportion of advanced fibrosis did not show statistically significant differences between AI-treated patients and the healthy patients. Those with abnormal baseline fasting glucose levels are suggested to have increased risk of NAFLD development after aromatase inhibitor treatment. In addition, patients with NAFLD developed after aromatase inhibitor use had significantly lower disease-free survival than those without NAFLD, although there was no significant difference in overall survival. Conclusion: Results of this study suggest that inhibition of estrogen synthesis in postmenopausal women undergoing treatment with aromatase inhibitors could increase the risk of NAFLD, which might have some influence on the prognosis of patients with breast cancer. Implications for Practice: Unlike tamoxifen, the role of aromatase inhibitor treatment use in postmenopausal patients with breast cancer in development of fatty liver is not well known. In this propensity-matched cohort study, postmenopausal patients with breast cancer treated with aromatase inhibitors had increased risk of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease compared with healthy women after menopause, independent of obesity and diabetes mellitus. The results show possible adverse influence of the newly developed fatty liver on breast cancer disease-free survival and suggest a necessity for further validation.

In case of benign lesions, an attempt should be made to achieve an exact classification. The most common benign focal liver lesions include liver cysts, focal fatty liver deposition or sparing, haemangiomas, focal calcifications, focal nodular hyperplasia (FNH), nodular regenerative hyperplasia, biliary hamartomas (von-Meyenburg complexes) and hepatocellular adenomas.

Interim data up to January 2017 (database not locked) report the safety, tolerability and efficacy of tofacitinib for patients (pts) with active PsA from ≤36 months' participation in an ongoing open-label, long-term extension study (LTE; NCT01976364 OPAL Balance). Methods: Eligible pts from 2 pivotal Phase (P)3 tofacitinib PsA studies (NCT01877668 OPAL Broaden, NCT01882439 OPAL Beyond) could enter a 3-year LTE ≤3 months after completing the qualifying study or discontinuing for reasons unrelated to the study drug. Pts received tofacitinib 5 mg twice daily (BID) for 1 month, after which an increase to 10 mg BID for efficacy reasons or a reduction back to 5 mg BID for safety reasons was permitted. All pts entered on a background of a csDMARD, as was mandated by the qualifying studies. Primary endpoints were incidence and severity of adverse events (AEs) and change from baseline in laboratory values. Efficacy was a secondary endpoint. Results: 686 pts were enrolled and treated in OPAL Balance and 530 pts (77.3%) remained at data cut-off. Mean (range) duration of tofacitinib exposure in the LTE was 448 (1-1,015) days. On Day 1, 676 (98.5%) pts received a csDMARD, of which 56 (8.3%) later discontinued. To Month 36, 1,685 AEs were reported in 502 (73.2%) pts, 72 (10.5%) pts had serious AEs, and 52 (7.6%) discontinued due to AEs. AEs of special interest included 11 serious infections (1.6%), 19 herpes zoster events (2.8%) including 1 serious event of facial herpes zoster, 2 major adverse cardiovascular events (0.3%), and 13 (1.9%) malignancies. No AEs of gastrointestinal perforation or inflammatory bowel disease were reported. One AE of uveitis was reported. There were 4 deaths (not attributed to treatment, as assessed by the investigator) due to metastatic pancreatic carcinoma, acute cardiac failure/hypertensive heart disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and pulmonary embolism. Four AEs of latent tuberculosis were reported in pts whose previously negative QuantiFERON response became positive. Few pts experienced elevated liver enzyme levels; ALT was elevated ≥3 x ULN in 20 (2.9%) pts, AST ≥3 x ULN in 11 (1.6%) pts. Four (0.6%) pts met discontinuation criteria for laboratory values due to 2 sequential hemoglobin values <8.0 g/dL or decreases >30% from baseline value, 2 sequential platelet counts <75 x109/L, 2 sequential AST or ALT elevations ≥5 x ULN regardless of total bilirubin or accompanying signs or symptoms, and 2 sequential increases in serum creatinine >50% and an increase >0.5 mg/dL over average of screening and baseline.

The incidence of breast cancer is correlated with metabolic component including diabetes, hypertension, and obesity. Likewise breast cancer, metabolic components are important risk factors for development of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). In this study, we analyzed the prevalence of NAFLD in patients with breast cancer and the effect of NAFLD on the prognosis of breast cancer. Method: Total 492 patients with breast cancer who received operation were enrolled from January 2010 to June 2014. Patients who had other chronic liver disease including chronic viral hepatitis B/C, autoimmune hepatitis, and primary biliary cholangitis and significant alcohol abuse (more than 140 g/week in women and 210 g/week in men) were excluded. Hepatic steatosis was evaluated by non-enhanced computed tomography (CT) scan. We measured values of regions of interest (ROI) for 5 times in liver and spleen, respectively. We diagnosed NAFLD when the average ROI of liver is higher than it of spleen 15 or more. 135 healthy controls who took non-enhanced CT scan were also analyzed. Results: Mean age and BMI were 51.6 ± 11.0 years and 24.7 ± 9.9 kg/m2, respectively. The prevalence of DM and hypertension were 9.5% and 24.6%, respectively. The prevalence of NAFLD in patients with breast cancer was 43.5% (214/492) and it was significantly higher comparing with healthy control (29.6%, 40/135) (p = 0.004).

The primary outcome was newly developed fatty liver detected on annual liver ultrasonography. Results Among 328 matched subjects (mean age 53.5 years, body mass index 22.9 kg/m2), 62 cases of fatty liver in the TMX group and 41 cases in the AI group were detected in a total of 987.4 person-years.

The risk score we created might be used for treatment decision-making. Purpose To investigate the relationship between tamoxifen-associated nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and survival outcomes in patients with breast cancer. Methods Patients with early-stage invasive breast cancer after curative resection from January 2009 to June 2011 were selected. A total of 646 patients who were treated with tamoxifen were included. Patients diagnosed with NAFLD on ultrasonography were classified into the NAFLD and non-NAFLD groups. Results The NAFLD group included 221 patients, and the non-NAFLD group included 425 patients. Patients in the NAFLD group had significantly higher body mass index than those in the non-NAFLD group (P &#x003C; .001). Disease-free survival was significantly longer in the non-NAFLD group than the NAFLD group (P = .006). However, there were no significant statistical differences between these 2 groups on overall survival (P = .387).

High derived neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio (dNLR) has been shown to be prognostic in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer. The aim of this analysis is to evaluate dNLR as a predictive biomarker of the survival according to RAS and BRAF mutations status within the COIN trial. A post-hoc exploratory analysis of the COIN trial arms A and B was carried out. All patients with available white blood cell and neutrophil data were analysed. The dNLR was calculated using a formula that has previously shown predictive power in cancer patients: dNLR=ANC/(WBC-ANC). A high dNLR was defined as a value of 2.2 or more. dNLR was correlated with clinical outcomes using Kaplan-Meier and Cox regression analysis. A total of 1603 patients were assigned to the oxaliplatin-based chemotherapy (arm A, N=815) or oxaliplatin-based chemotherapy plus cetuximab (arm B, N=815) arms. There was a strong association between dNLR level and overall survival (OS) using Kaplan-Meier analysis. In all mutation groups, dNLR less than 2.2 was associated with better OS compared to dNLR of 2.2 or more. The median OS in patients with wild-type disease (dNLR<2.2 vs. dNLR≥2.2) was 22.8 versus 13.1 months [hazard ratio (HR)=1.33]; 16.9 versus 11.8 months (HR=1.36) in patients with RAS mutant tumours; and 12.6 versus 6.8 months (HR=1.67) in patients with BRAF mutant tumours. In patients with dNLR less than 2.2, the median OS was 19.2 months in arm A compared to 18.0 months in arm B (HR=1.11). Among patients with dNLR greater than or equal to 2.2, the median OS was 13.0 months in arm A compared with 13.1 months in arm B (HR=0.96). dNLR is strongly prognostic for survival in all mutation groups. dNLR does not predict for benefit from the addition of cetuximab."
416,1693,1854,Derived neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio as prognostic factor in patients with advanced colorectal cancer according RAS and BRAF mutations status: A post-hoc analysis of the MRC COIN study,"Grenader, T.; Nash, S.; Adams, R.; Kaplan, R.; Fisher, D.; Maugham, T.; Bridgewater, J.",,"Background: The Continuous or Intermittent (COIN) trial is a phase III randomized that shown prognostic effect of BRAF, KRAS, and NRAS mutations on the outcome of patients with advanced colorectal cancer, but failed to prove a benefit of addition of cetuximab to oxaliplatin-based chemotherapy in first line treatment of patients with advanced colorectal cancer. Neutrophil lymphocyte ratio (NLR) is an inexpensive marker of host inflammation; it has been recently shown as a prognostic factor in advanced colorectal cancer. The aim of the current analysis was to evaluate derived NLR (dNLR) as a predictor of the survival according RAS and BRAF mutations status. Methods: A post-hoc exploratory analysis of COIN arms A and B was performed. Landmark analysis was conducted on all patients with available WBC and neutrophils data. Unfortunately, lymphocyte data was not collected in patients entry to COIN trial The dNLR was calculated using a formula that was previously shown to have predictive power in cancer patients: A high dNLR was defined using a cut-off value of >3.0. NLR was then correlated with clinical outcomes including overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS). Survival curves were generated based on NLR using the Kaplan-Meier method. Comparison between groups was performed using Cox regression. Results: WBC and ANC results were available in 1608 of the 1630 COIN trial arms A and B participants. Of these, 385 (23.9%) were deemed to have a high dNLR. In univariable analysis, low dNLR was associated with a favourable hazard ratio (HR) for OS of 1.74 (1.53-1.98), p < 0.001, compared to high NLR, equating to median OS values of 16.9 (95% CI 16.1-18.1) and 10.7 months (95% CI 9.5-12.4) respectively. dNLR remained highly significant for OS (HR 1.47, 95% CI 1.28-1.68, p < 0.001) in a multi-variable model including PS, age, RAS and BRAF mutations status, presence of extrahepatic metastases, and number of metastatic sites. No interaction was found between dNLR status and treatment arm. Low dNLR was associated with better OS compared to high dNLR in all mutations groups. Median OS (1) all wild type 21.6 vs 15.2 months (HR 1.77, 95% CI 1.41-2.24, p < 0.001); (2) RAS mutant 15.6 vs 9.6 months (HR 1.79, 95% CI 1.45 to 2.21, p < 0.001) (3) BRAF mutant 12.5 vs 6.4 (HR 2.24, 95% CI 1.41 to 3.55, p = 0.001). In univariable analysis, there was a suggestion (P = 0.10) of a differential effect of cetuximab on OS between the two dNLR groups in patients with BRAF mutation. HR among patients with low dNLR was 0.91 (95% CI 0.54 to 1.54), in contrast to 2.81 (95% CI 1.31 to 6.01) for patients with high dNLR. Conclusion: dNLR is prognostic for survival in all mutations groups especially in patients with BRAF mutant tumors. In BRAF mutated tumors dNLR >3 may be predictive against the addition of cetuximab added to oxaliplatin-based chemotherapy."

Methods: We evaluated 104 patients surgically treated for breast cancer at our hospital between September and November 2013. None of the patients had any other causes of secondary hepatic fat accumulation (such as significant alcohol consumption, use of steatogenic medication or inborn disorders). Hepatic fat accumulation was measured using liver MRI perfomed in all patients before surgical treatment. Results: Based on the fat signal percentage from liver MRIs, 19 of 104 breast cancer patients were diagnosed with NAFLD, so the prevalence of NAFLD was 18.3%. In univariate analysis, factors associated with NAFLD were older age, high body mass index, type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM), hypertension, elevated aspartate aminotransferase, elevated alanine aminotransferase and elevated triglycerides (TG). In multivariate analysis, factors associated with NAFLD were high body mass index (BMI) (odds ratio [OR] 1.403; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.111-1.771; p = 0.005), type 2 DM (OR 11.872; 95% CI 1.065-132.373; p = 0.044), and an elevated TG level (OR 50.267; 95% CI 4.409-573.030; p = 0.002).

For the past decades, the incidence and mortality rate of CRC has been increased in Japan which corresponds with the economic development and concomitant shifts from traditional lifestyle towards a westernized lifestyle. The association of metabolic syndrome (MetS) and CRC has been reported in several studies, however, individual factors contributing to CRC occurrence have been obscure, especially in Japan. Aims & Methods: In the present study, we investigated the risk factors such as metabolic and lifestyle factors for the occurrence of colorectal neoplasia (CRN) including adenomatous polyps as precancerous lesionsby using comprehensive health checkup data. We conducted a retrospective analysis in clinical practice at a single center. Among 7213 subjects who took comprehensive health checkup at our hospital between in August 2012 and July 2015, 1835 subjects who also underwent screening colonoscopy were enrolled. Sixty-three subjects were excluded for analyzes because they did not take computed tomography (CT) for visceral fat area (VFA) measurement. In the present study, CRN was defined as adenomatous polyp≥5mm in size and adenocarcinoma. A diagnosis of MetS was made by Metabolic Syndrome Diagnostic Criteria Exploratory Committee in Japan. Demographic characteristics, anthropometric measurements, VFA measured at the umbilical level by CT, hematological metabolic parameters, degree of liver fat evaluated by ultrasonography, and current smoking and drinking habits were assessed. Association between variables and CRN was evaluated by univariate analysis using t-test, χ2 test, Mann-Whitney test, and then by multivariate analysis using multiple logistic regression model. A p value50.05 was considered statistically significant. Results: Of 1772 subjects (men: 1206, women: 566) analyzed, 195 subjects had CRN (11.0%) and 5 had invasive colorectal cancer (0.3%). Four hundred and forty-six subjects were diagnosed as MetS (25.2%; 31.3% in men, 12.0% in women) and presence of MetS was significantly associated with CRN both in men (p=0.016) and women (p<0.01). Univariate analysis identified significant association of age, body mass index (BMI), VFA, systolic blood pressure (SBP), low-density lipoprotein (LDL)-cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein (HDL)-cholesterol, triglycerides (TG), fasting plasma glucose, hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), fatty liver, current smoking habits, current drinking habits and ≥10 kg weight gain compared with the body weight at the age of twenty with prevalence of CRN. Logistic regression analysis revealed that age, current smoking, BMI, SBP, LDL and HDL-cholesterol and TG were independent factors associated with CRN prevalence (Table). Conclusion: The present study demonstrated that metabolic factors in addition to aging and current smoking might be risk factors for CRN in Japan. This may help to identify high-risk subjects in CRC screening strategies."

Non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is closely associated with hepatic fibrosis (HF). The number of patients who suffer from NASH is increasing because of the consumption of high-calorie diets. It remains unclear how much of an impact NASH and HF have on the development of liver metastasis in CRC. Methods: Patients who underwent curative surgical resection for CRC between 2000 and 2011 were included in this study. We evaluated the progression of HF by the non-alcoholic fatty liver disease fibrosis score (NFS) based on preoperative blood test results, age, body mass index, and diabetes mellitus. Patients were grouped according to high (fibrotic liver; FL) or low (normal liver; NL) NFS. The influence of HF on hepatic recurrence was assessed by survival analyses. Results: A total of 953 CRC patients were enrolled, comprising 293 in stage I, 327 in stage II, and 333 in stage III. The patients included were categorised as FL (77) or NL (876). The hepatic recurrence rates were 5.3% in the NL group and 10.4% in the FL group (P=0.02), whereas the overall recurrence rates were 16.0% in the NL group and 20.7% in the FL group (P=0.03). The 5-year liver-specific recurrence-free survival rate in the FL group was significantly poorer than that in the NL group (FL 89.1%, 95% confidence interval (CI) 78.4-94.7 vs NL 96.0%, 95% CI 94.3-97.2, log-rank test P<0.01). Multivariate analysis demonstrated that HF significantly promoted liver-specific recurrence compared with NL (HR=2.98, 95% CI 1.23-7.21; P=0.02).

Multivariate analysis demonstrated that HF significantly promoted liver-specific recurrence compared with NL (HR=2.98, 95% CI 1.23-7.21; P=0.02). CONCLUSION: HF is a valuable prognostic factor for hepatic recurrence after curative surgical resection of CRC."

436,1776,1776,Impact of Tumor Size on Probability of Pathologic Complete Response After Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy,"Baron, P.; Beitsch, P.; Boselli, D.; Symanowski, J.; Pellicane, J.V.; Beatty, J.; Richards, P.; Mislowsky, A.; Nash, C.; Lee, L.A.; Murray, M.; de Snoo, F.A.; Stork-Sloots, L.; Gittleman, M.; Akbari, S.; Whitworth, P.",10.1245/s10434-015-5030-1,"Background: The prospective Neoadjuvant Breast Symphony Trial (NBRST) study found that MammaPrint/BluePrint functional molecular subtype is superior to conventional immunohistochemistry/fluorescence in situ hybridization subtyping for predicting pathologic complete response (pCR) to neoadjuvant chemotherapy. The purpose of this substudy was to determine if the rate of pCR is affected by tumor size. Methods: The NBRST study includes breast cancer patients who received neoadjuvant chemotherapy. MammaPrint/BluePrint subtyping classified patients into four molecular subgroups: Luminal A, Luminal B, HER2 (human epidermal growth factor receptor 2), and Basal type. Probability of pCR (ypT0/isN0) as a function of tumor size and molecular subgroup was evaluated. Results: A total of 608 patients were evaluable with overall pCR rates of 28.5 %. Luminal A and B patients had significantly lower rates of pCR (6.1 and 8.7 %, respectively) than either basal (37.1 %) or HER2 (55.0 %) patients (p < 0.001). The probability of pCR significantly decreased with tumor size >5 cm [p = 0.022, odds ratio (OR) 0.58, 95 % confidence interval (CI) 0.36, 0.93]. This relationship was statistically significant in the Basal (p = 0.026, OR 0.46, 95 % CI 0.23, 0.91) and HER2 (p = 0.039, OR 0.36, 95 % CI 0.14, 0.95) subgroups. In multivariate logistic regression analyses, the dichotomized tumor size variable was not significant in any of the molecular subgroups. Discussion: Even though tumor size would intuitively be a clinical determinant of pCR, the current analysis showed that the adjusted OR for tumor size was not statistically significant in any of the molecular subgroups. Factors significantly associated with pCR were PR status, grade, lymph node status, and BluePrint molecular subtyping, which had the strongest correlation."

For triple-negative and HER2 tumors, pathologic complete response (pCR) correlates with excellent survival. The Neoadjuvant BReast Symphony Trial (NBRST) found that the 80-gene BluePrint (BP) functional molecular subtype is superior to conventional IHC/FISH subtyping for predicting complete pathologic response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy. The purpose of this substudy was to determine if the pCR rate is also impacted by tumor size. Methods The NBRST study is a prospective registry of women aged 18 to 90 with biopsy-proven invasive cancer who undergo NCT (or neoadjuvant endocrine therapy, excluded in this substudy) following written informed consent. The largest pre-NCT size measurement from mammogram, ultrasound, or MRI was used. T stage was determined by the treating physician. NCT adhered to peer-reviewed established regimens. pCR was defined as no residual invasive cancer in either the breast or axilla of the resected specimen. BluePrint subtyping, combined with MammaPrint, classified patients into 4 molecular subgroups: Luminal A (MammaPrint Low Risk), Luminal B (MammaPrint High Risk), HER2, and Basal-type. Logistic regression was used to model the probability of pCR as a function of tumor size and molecular subgroup. Fisher exact test was used to compare pCR rates by T size. Results A total of 591 patients were evaluable. The overall pCR rate was 26%. The Luminal-type patients had <10% pCR rate, statistically significantly less than the pCR rate for Basal and HER2 subtypes (p < 0.0001). Overall, the probability of pCR significantly decreased with increasing tumor size (p = 0.007). However, this relationship to tumor size was significantly impacted by molecular subgroup (interaction p-value = 0.005). The effect of tumor size was significant in the Basal subgroup (p = 0.003). pCR by T stage also decreased with increasing T size: T1, 32% (19/60); T2, 29% (102/354); T3, 17% (25/146). The p-value for pCR of T1 and T2 vs T3 tumors was 0.004. Conclusion These data show that the likelihood of a pCR following NCT is less for larger tumors overall, driven mainly by a significant impact in the Basal subgroup. Luminal A and B do not usually have pCR with current neoadjuvant chemotherapy (importantly, pCR does not predict survival in Luminal A/B). Targeted therapy in the HER2 group may reduce differences in response due to size of the primary. Larger basal tumors may need either longer (more courses) of NAC or perhaps a better delineation of targeted therapy (for example platinum/PARP inhibitor in BRCA/BRCA-like basal subtypes) to optimize pCR rates.

They are live micro-organisms which, when administered in adequate amounts, confer a health benefit to the host. From this very well-known definition, it is clear that, unlike drugs, probiotics might be useful in healthy subjects to reduce the risk of developing certain diseases or to optimise some physiological functions. They also may offer some advantages in already ill persons in relieving symptoms and signs, e.g. people with acute diarrhea. According to current definitions, probiotics should survive both gastric acid and bile to reach the small intestine and colon, where they exert their effects. Many of these are available in a lyophilized (freezedried) pill form, though some are available in yogurt or as packets (sachets), which can be mixed into non-carbonated drinks. The present review focuses on three main issues: 1) understanding why, at present, probiotics are so interesting for doctors and consumers; 2) reviewing the available data on probiotic use in digestive diseases, in particular irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), (prevention of) infectious diarrhea, inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), and colorectal cancer (CRC); 3) highlighting the individual profile of Lactobacillus GG (LGG) in the above contexts, providing an assessment as well as recommendations on its use in gastro-intestinal tract (GIT) disorders. Research studies conducted in animals and humans with the main probiotics strains for GIT diseases, and published from the early 1990s to 2014 have been considered. PubMed, Medline and Ovid were the main sources adopted for data retrieving. The increasing attention on probiotics is a direct consequence of the improvement in the techniques for studying microbiota. Until recently, its composition has been analysed by culture-based methods that use differential media to select for specific populations of bacteria according to their metabolic requirements. Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium species are by and large the most commonly used probiotics. Strictly speaking, however, the term ""probiotic"" should be reserved for live microbes that have been shown in controlled human studies to provide a health benefit. Taking into account patients suffering from the most common gastrointestinal diseases, in whose establishment the GI microbiota plays a key role, probiotics have to be considered as very promising agents, capable of beneficially modulating the intestinal ecosystem, which is perturbed in cases of dysbiosis. Although more clinical data are still needed to better assess the clinical relevance of probiotics, to date, procariota such as Bifidobacteria and Lactobacilli strains, and eucariota such as some Saccharomyces strains are among the most widely used agents in GIT disorders. LGG is a well-known probiotic strain that was isolated more than 20 years ago by Goldin and Gorbach from a faecal sample of a healthy adult, based on several selection criteria: high adhesion in vitro, high resistance against gastric acidity and high antimicrobial activity against pathogens such as Salmonella. In vivo studies have also shown a good persistence of LGG in the human GIT. Since its isolation, LGG has become one of the best clinically documented probiotic strains. A growing body of evidence suggests benefits such as prevention and relief of various types of diarrhoea, and treatment of relapsing Clostridium difficile colitis.

Mismatch repair deficient (dMMR) CRC is more commonly located in the proximal colon with decreasing incidence distally; thus, dMMR rectal cancer has not been well characterized. Our study aimed to describe the clinicopathologic features and outcomes of patients with LS-associated rectal cancer. Materials/Methods: Clinical genetics database review (1998-2014) identified all probands with CRC and a deleterious germline mutation in a MMR gene (MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, PMS2) diagnostic of LS. Clinical history and pedigree was extracted from medical records and Progeny. The Dworak classification was used for tumor regression grade (TRG) from grade 0 (no regression) to grade 4 (total regression). Results: Of 192 LS patients with CRC, 27(14.1%) had RC. Mean age at RC diagnosis was 39.7 years (range, 22-59) with 18.5% having synchronous (n=3) or metachronous (n=2) colon cancer. In 85% of cases, the RC was the first LS-associated malignancy. While all RC patients met Revised Bethesda, only 48% met Amsterdam II criteria. Twenty-three rectal tumors were analyzed for MSI or defective MMR protein expression by immunohistochemistry; results were abnormal and concordant with germline test results in all cases. Nineteen (70%) patients harbored either an MSH2 or MSH6 gene mutation, with only 8 (30%) being MLH1 or PMS2 carriers. Of 25 RC patients with clinical data, 12 proceeded directly to surgery (7 stage 0/ I; 5 stage II/III). Thirteen RC patients received preop neoadjuvant treatment for clinical stage II/III (n=11) or IV (n=2) disease, including 12 receiving chemoradiation and 6 also receiving FOLFOX chemotherapy. Downstaging of the primary tumor occurred in 69.2% (9/13) and of lymph nodes in 75% (9/12) of cases. All 13 RC patients underwent R0 resections and 10 patients had TRG available. Two (20%) patients had TRG 1, 7 (70%) had TRG 2 or 3 and 1 (10%) had TRG 4. One patient received preop FOLFOX for cT3N+ disease without chemoradiation with excellent clinical response initially; however, surgical pathology showed ypT4N2 disease with subsequent rapid development of metastatic disease. Another patient with cT4N2M1 (nonregional lymph node) progressed through induction FOLFOX, but after receiving chemoradiation was downstaged to ypT3N0M0. With a median follow-up of 4.6 years (range, 0.08-17.0), 2 had local and distant recurrences and 4 developed a subsequent LS-associated cancer. Conclusion: Although less common than colon cancer, rectal cancer may be the index cancer leading to a diagnosis of LS and appears to be overrepresented in MSH2/MSH6 gene mutation carriers. Further analysis to compare outcomes and prognosis with non-Lynch and sporadic dMMR rectal cancers is needed."

Although LS-associated colon cancer is associated with both favorable prognosis and lack of efficacy to 5-fluorouracil, clinical features of LS-associated rectal cancer (RC) have not been characterized. Methods: Clinical genetics database review (1998-2012) identified all probands with CRC and a deleterious germline mutation in a MMR gene (MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, PMS2) diagnostic of LS. Probands without identifiable mutations or variants of unknown significance were excluded. Clinical history and pedigree was extracted from medical records and Progeny. Results: Of 119 LS patients with CRC, 16 (13.4%) had RC. Mean age at RC diagnosis was 40.6 (range, 23-56) with 31% having synchronous (n=3) or metachronous (n=2) colon cancer. All RC patients met Revised Bethesda and 63% met Amsterdam II criteria. As opposed to LS-associated colon cancer, the majority of RC patients harbored MSH2 mutations (36% colon vs 69% RC, p value 0.01). 11 tumors were analyzed for MSI or defective MMR protein expression by IHC; results were abnormal and thereby concordant with germline test results in all cases. Of 14 RC patients with clinical data, 5 proceeded directly to surgery (4 stage 0/I; 1 stage II). Nine patients received pre-op treatment for clinical stage II/III (n=7) or IV (n=2) disease, with all receiving chemoradiation and five also receiving pre-op FOLFOX. Downstaging of primary tumor occurred in 66.6% (6/9) and of lymph nodes in 77.7% (7/9) of cases. All nine patients underwent R0 resections; however, pCR was not observed in any of the cases. Notably, one patient with clinical T3N+ disease (by MRI and EUS) had upfront surgery identifying pT2N0 disease with prominent tumor infiltrating lymphocytes. Of 14 patients, mean follow-up of 4.3 years (range, 0.3-13.5), none had disease recurrence; however, one was diagnosed with a new primary colon cancer. Conclusions: Although less common than colon cancer,RC is an important component of LS and may be overrepresented in MSH2 mutation carriers. Given high risk of synchronous or metachronous cancers, appropriate surveillance for second malignancies is necessary."

We report a case of Langerhan's cell histiocytosis with sclerosing cholangitis in an adult with excellent clinical response to cladribine-based chemotherapy. Case History: 71 years old female with history of Langerhans's cell histiocytosis and breast cancer presented to us with itching and jaundice. Laboratory studies were pertinent for abnormal liver function tests (LFTs); bilirubin of 2.7 mg/dL, Alkaline Phosphatase 990 IU/L, Aspartate Aminotransferase 91 IU/L, Alanine Aminotransferase 106 IU/L. One year ago, patient initially presented with generalized skin eruption. She also started to have symptoms of polyuria and polydipsia suggestive of diabetes insipidus. PETCT showed focal FDG uptake pituitary gland; no PET bony metastases were noted. A clinical diagnosis of Langerhan's histiocytosis was made. She was treated symptomatically with Desmopression for symptoms of polyuria and polydipsia. At this time, her labs were extensively reviewed. MRI abdomen showed no biliary ductal dilatation. Changes consistent with fatty liver were noted on MRI. A skin biopsy showed compact parakeratosis overlying an epidermis with acanthosis and spongiosis with a dense infiltrate of Langerhans cells within the superficial dermis. EUS revealed distal bile duct wall thickening without focal mass lesions. FNA from bile duct wall was negative for malignancy. ERCP revealed dominant strictures involving distal bile duct and common hepatic duct. Cholangiogram demonstrated multiple focal irregularities involving the intra-hepatic ducts. Serial balloon dilatation of the biliary strictures involving main duct was performed. Bile duct brushings were performed. Stent was not placed. No atypical cells were seen on brushing cytology. There was no significant improvement in LFTs after ERCP. Patient was then treated with cladribine-based chemotherapy. LFTs improved to baseline with significant improvement in bilirubin (0/9 mg/dL) and Alkaline Phosphatase (490 mg/dL).

However at present, the methodology for molecular subtyping is not standardized. The aim of the prospective NBRST study is to compare chemosensitivity as defined by pathological Complete Response (pCR) using the 80-gene BluePrint (BP) functional subtype profile vs. conventional IHC/FISH subtyping. Methods: The study includes women aged 18-90 with histologically proven breast cancer, written informed consent, no excision biopsy or axillary dissection, and no prior therapy for breast cancer. Neo-adjuvant Chemotherapy (NCT) was at the discretion of the physician adhering to NCCN approved or other peer-reviewed regimens. BP in combination with MammaPrint classifies patients into 4 molecular subgroups: Luminal A, Luminal B, HER2 and Basal. Results: 721 patients had definitive surgery. 58/335 (17%) IHC/FISH HR+/HER2- patients were re-classified by BP as Basal (57) or HER2 (1). 92/222 (41%) IHC/FISH HER2+ patients were re-classified as BP Luminal (67) or BP Basal (25). 7/164 (4%) IHC/FISH triple negative (TN) patients were re-classified as BP Luminal (5) or BP HER2 (2). NCT pCR rates were 3% in Luminal A and 9% in Luminal B patients versus 10% pCR in IHC/FISH luminal patients. The NCT pCR rate was 54% in BP HER2 patients. This is significantly superior (p = 0.02) to the pCR rate in IHC/FISH HER2+ patients (40%). BP Basal and IHC/FISH TN had a pCR rate of 35%. Functional BP subtyping divided the 137 IHC/FISH triple positive patients into two major subgroups: BP Luminal (n = 66, pCR = 11%) and BP HER2 (n = 60, pCR = 45%).11 patients were re-classified as BP Basal with pCR = 45%. Conclusions: Molecular subtyping using BP leads to a reclassification of 23% of tumors. The re-classification is most prominent in classically assessed triple positive patients where 48% of patients are re-assigned to the less responsive BP Luminal-type group vs. 44% of patients assigned to the responsive BP HER2-type group. These findings confirm the more accurate identification of molecular subgroups for treatment decision by BluePrint functional subtype classifier."

BP in combination with MammaPrint classifies patients into 4 molecular subgroups: Luminal A, Luminal B, HER2 and Basal. Results: 721 patients had definitive surgery. 58/335 (17%) IHC/FISH HR+/HER2-patients were re-classified by BP as Basal (57) or HER2 (1). 92/222 (41%) IHC/FISH HER2+ patients were re-classified as BP Luminal (67) or BP Basal (25). 7/164 (4%) IHC/FISH triple negative (TN) patients were re-classified as BP Luminal (5) or BP HER2 (2). NCT pCR rates were 3% in Luminal A and 9% in Luminal B patients versus 10% pCR in IHC/FISH luminal patients. The NCT pCR rate was 54% in BP HER2 patients. This is significantly superior (p = 0.02) to the pCR rate in IHC/FISH HER2+ patients (40%). BP Basal and IHC/FISH TN had a pCR rate of 35%. Functional BP subtyping divided the 137 IHC/FISH triple positive patients into two major subgroups: BP Luminal (n = 66, pCR = 11%) and BP HER2 (n = 60, pCR = 45%).11 patients were re-classified as BP Basal with pCR = 45%. Conclusions: Molecular subtyping using BP leads to a re-classification of 23% of tumors. The re-classification is most prominent in classically assessed triple positive patients where 48% of patients are re-assigned to the less responsive BP Luminal-type group vs. 44% of patients assigned to the responsive BP HER2-type group. These findings confirm the more accurate identification of molecular subgroups for treatment decision by BluePrint functional subtype classifier."
448,1846,1869,Functional subtyping with BluePrint 80-gene profile identifies two distinct triple positive subtypes with and without trastuzumab/chemo-sensitivity: Implications for treatment from the NBRST registry,"Whitworth, P.; Beatty, J.; Baron, P.; Richards, P.; Pellicane, J.; Mislowsky, A.; Nash, C.; Lee, L.; Murray, M.; De Snoo, F.; Stork-Sloots, L.; Untch, S.; Gittleman, M.; Akbari, S.; Beitsch, P.",10.1158/1538-7445.SABCS14-P6-08-22,"Background Classification by molecular subtype can aid in the selection of therapy for patients with breast cancer. However at present, the methodology for molecular subtyping is not standardized and the methodology and interpretation of results vary between different laboratories. Subtype is being assigned using conventional immunohistochemistry (IHC) and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) (“conventional subtype”) or molecularly using gene expression profiling. The aim of the current prospective NBRST study is to compare chemosensitivity as defined by pathological Complete Response (pCR), or endocrine sensitivity as defined by partial response (PR) using the 80-gene BluePrint functional subtype profile vs. conventional IHC/FISH subtyping. Methods MINDACT is an international, prospective, randomized, phase III trial investigating the clinical utility of MammaPrint in selecting patients with early BC for adjuvant chemotherapy (CT), which enrolled 6,694 patients. Molecular subtyping data were obtained by MammaPrint and BluePrint (Agendia, Amsterdam, the Netherlands) on frozen samples (n=6,694) classifying patients in the following subtypes: Luminal A (Luminal-type/MammaPrint Low Risk); Luminal B (Luminal-type/MammaPrint High Risk); HER2-type; and Basal-type. ER, PgR, HER2 and Ki67 protein status were centrally assessed on FFPE blocks by IHC and/or FISH in the European Institute of Oncology, Milan, Italy (n=5,740; 86%). Patients were also classified according to the St. 2013 Gallen recommendations [Goldhirsch et al. 2013], which recognizes an additional category (Luminal B-like HER2+). Results Ki67 is often used as biomarker to distinguish Luminal A from Luminal B subgroups. The concordance between MammaPrint and centrally assessed Ki67 in Luminal-type patients is 60%, with a κ score of 0.26 (95% CI 0.24-0.28) indicating that Ki67 and MammaPrint cannot reliably substitute for each other. When using a cut-point of 20% instead of 14% the concordance increased to 78%, with a κ score of 0.44 (95% CI 0.41-0.47). There is a relatively large group of clinical HER2+ cases that are BluePrint Luminal-type (208 out of 541; 38%) indicating that tumor expression of the Luminal profile is dominant compared with expression of the HER2 profile. These patients have high IHC ER results and all except for 1 fall into the group that St Gallen separately defines as Luminal B-like HER2-positive. These patients may have lower response to trastuzumab [von Minckwitz et al. JCO 2012]. 98 out of 622 BluePrint Basal-type patients are clinical Luminal HER2-. 2/3 of these patients have low centrally assessed IHC PR expression and 1/3 have low centrally assessed ER expression (≥1% and <10%). Conclusions Molecular subtyping using BluePrint and MammaPrint leads to a reclassification of 22% (113/515) of tumors. The re-classification of patients leading to re-assignment to more responsive vs. less responsive groups is most prominent in classically assessed triple positive patients where 46% of patients are re-assigned to the less responsive BP Luminal-type group (pCR rate of 7%) vs. 46% of patients assigned to the responsive BP HER2-type group (pCR rate of 49%). These findings confirm the more accurate identification of molecular subgroups for treatment decision by BluePrint functional subtype classifier which may therefore serve as a better guide for neo-adjuvant treatment than standard, local IHC/FISH assay."

METHODS: This is a retrospective study of the clinical, laboratory and histological data of 120 patients diagnosed with primary or secondary hepatic neoplasms and treated at a tertiary center where they underwent hepatic resection and/or liver transplantation, with subsequent evaluation of the explant or liver biopsy. The following criteria were used to exclude patients from the study: a history of alcohol abuse, hepatitis B or C infection, no tumor detected in the liver tissue examined by histological analysis, and the presence of chronic autoimmune hepatitis, hemochromatosis, Wilson's disease, or hepatoblastoma. The occurrence of NAFLD and the association with its known risk factors were studied. The risk factors considered were diabetes mellitus, impaired glucose tolerance, impaired fasting glucose, body mass index, dyslipidemia, and arterial hypertension. Presence of reticulin fibers in the hepatic neoplasms was assessed by histological analysis using slide-mounted specimens stained with either hematoxylin and eosin or Masson's trichrome and silver impregnation. Analysis of tumor-free liver parenchyma was carried out to determine the association between NAFLD and its histological grade. RESULTS: No difference was found in the association of NAFLD with the general population (34.2% and 30.0% respectively, 95%CI: 25.8-43.4). Evaluation by cancer type showed that NAFLD was more prevalent in patients with liver metastasis of colorectal cancer than in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma and intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (OR = 3.99, 95%CI: 1.78-8.94, P < 0.001 vs OR = 0.60, 95%CI: 0.18-2.01, P = 0.406 and OR = 0.70, 95%CI: 0.18-2.80, P = 0.613, respectively). There was a higher prevalence of liver fibrosis in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (OR = 3.50, 95%CI: 1.06-11.57, P = 0.032). Evaluation of the relationship between the presence of NAFLD, nonalcoholic steatohepatitis, and liver fibrosis, and their risk factors, showed no significant statistical association for any of the tumors studied.

Nascimento, M.; Ferreira, F.G.; Ribeiro, M.A.; Szutan, L.A.",10.1016/S0016-5085(14)63447-8,"Background: The prevalence of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) has been increasing worldwide. The relation among non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) or intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (IHCC) has been reported, but it is still unknown if such associations exist in non-cirrhotic patients. Furthermore, it has been suggested that early stages of hepatic steatosis can already be considered a favorable microenvironment for the development of liver metastases of colorectal neoplasms (LMCN). Aims: To evaluate the association of NAFLD with primary and secondary malignancies of the liver and to compare the prevalence of this association in different tumor types. Methods: This was a retrospective study based on data from the anatomopathology records of 180 patients with hepatic neoplasms treated in a referral center of Brazil, from January 2007 to December 2011. Were excluded 60 patients due to previously known liver disease (viral hepatitis, alcohol abuse, autoimmune hepatitis, hemochromatosis and Wilson's disease), or absence of liver tissue free of tumor at histology material. We divided the remaining 120 cases in groups by type of cancer and a comparison was made among them, for each histological type. The histological samples were evaluated for the presence of hepatic steatosis, NASH and liver fibrosis. The presence of risk factors for NAFLD (glucose intolerance and/ or diabetes mellitus, dyslipidemia, arterial hypertension and overweight) was checked and the association of these predictors with the histological findings was quantified. Institution Ethic Committee approved the study and the statistical analysis was performed with the Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) version 13.0 and Epi Info version 3.4.3. The significance level for all tests was 5% (p < 0,05). Results: Both groups of each liver tumor were comparable regarding age and gender (Table 1). There was no difference in the association of hepatic steatosis with the general population (34.2% and 30% respectively, 95% CI: 25.8 to 43.4). The hepatic steatosis was more prevalent in patients with LMCN while the prevalence of liver fibrosis was higher in the HCC group (Table 2). No case of NASH in combination with any of the three tumor types was observed. Regarding the relationship of hepatic steatosis, NASH and liver fibrosis with risk factors, no association was found statistically significant in any of the tumors studied. Conclusion: NAFLD is associated with liver metastases from colorectal cancer, but not with the other liver tumor types. (Table Presented)."

The respective roles of intravisceral and subcutaneous fat are unknown and the prevalence of precancerous lesions in obese patients was never evaluated. AIMS & METHODS: To characterize the frequency and severity of pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PanIN) in patients with fatty pancreas, to correlate pathological findings with metabolic abnormalities, tobacco intake and type of fat. Consecutive pancreatic specimens of patients operated on for benign neuroendocrine tumors were analyzed. The pancreatic parenchyma was analyzed at least 2 cm apart from the tumor. Fatty infiltration and fibrosis of the parenchyma in intra- and extralobular locations were assessed. Dysplastic lesions were described according to the PanIN classification. General characteristics of the patients were collected, including body mass index (BMI), diabetes and tobacco intake. Liver steatosis was assessed by CT scan (mean of 3 regions of interest, threshold >58UH). The subcutaneous and intravisceral fat (% of the total area) was estimated on CTscan by the ImageJ software (1.47, NIH, USA). RESULTS: 110 patients (males: 57%) were included (median surface of pancreatic specimen: 7.5 cm2). Median age at surgery was 53.8 [17-85] years. Arterial hypertension, diabetes, tobacco intake were found in 19, 9 and 23%, respectively. Median BMI was 24 [16-37], (BMI<25: 45%, 25-<30: 24%, >30: 11%). Overall, PanIN lesions were found in 65% of the patients, Type 1, 2 and 3 PanIN were observed in 62, 38 and 1% of the cases, respectively. Fibrosis and fatty pancreas (intra- and extralobular locations) were found in 1% and 24% and in 30% and 51%, respectively. Liver steatosis was observed in 27%. A correlation was observed between the presence of PanIN lesions on one hand and fatty pancreas [extra- (0.01) and intralobular (<0.0001)], intralobular fibrosis (0.003), high BMI (p=0.02), liver steatosis (p=0.03) and subcutaneous (p=0.02) and intravisceral fat (p=0.02) on the other. Presence of PanIN was not influenced by tobacco intake or diabetes. The number of PanIN lesions was correlated with the severity of liver steatosis (r=-0.25, p=0.02), the percentage of intravisceral fat (r=0.22, p=0.04) but not with the percentage of subcutaneous fat (r=0.14, p=0.22) or patient age at surgery.

It remains unclear how much impact such excessive local fat accumulation has on the development of hepatic tumour metastasized by colorectal cancer (CRC). The aim of this study was to clarify the influence of fatty liver on metachronous liver-specific recurrence after curative surgical resection of CRCs. Method: Between 2005 and 2010, patients who had a curative surgical resection for CRC were included in this study. The mean attenuation values of the liver and spleen were obtained on a preoperative plain CT slice. The patients with liver-spleen attenuation ratio lower than 1.1 were objectively defined as hepatic steatosis (HS). To distinguish the influence of excessive fat accumulation in the whole body, the analysis were conducted by preoperative body mass index (BMI), which was categorized into obese (BMI more than 25 kg/m2) or non-obese (BMI less than 25 kg/m2). Results: A total of 602 CRC patients were enrolled, comprised of 136 obese and 466 non-obese. In non-obese patients, 5-year liver-specific disease- free survival (DFS) rate in HS was significantly poorer than non-HS (HS 86.2% vs non-HS 94.2%, log-rank P = 0.031). HS significantly promoted liver-specific recurrence compared to non-HS (HR = 0.403, 95% CI 0.171-0.950; P = 0.038). However, this effect was not evident in the group of patients in obese (HR = 1.948, 95%CI 0.223-16.99; P = 0.546).

The objectives of this study is to clarify the influence of fatty liver on metachronous liver-specific recurrence after curative surgical resection of CRCs. Methods: Between 2005 and 2010, patients who had a curative surgical resection for CRC were included in this study.

The patients with liver-spleen attenuation ratio lower than 1.1 were objectively defined as hepatic steatosis (HS). To distinguish the influence of excessive fat accumulation in the whole body, the analysis were conducted by preoperative body mass index (BMI), which was categorized into obese (BMI more than 25kg/m2) or nonobese (BMI less than 25kg/m2).

Fractional polynomial analysis demonstrated that the relationship between HS and liver-specific recurrence were seriously different. Conclusions: The impact of HS on hepatic recurrence after curative surgical resection of CRCs were significantly different between obese and non-obese CRC patients. These findings indicated that HS occurred in non-obese population might be a favorable microenvironment for liver metastasis. (Figure presented)."

The most frequently reported serious infections in the cumulative period were pneumonia (IR: 0.43 [0.34, 0.54]), upper respiratory tract infection (0.18 [0.12, 0.26]) and cellulitis (0.15 [0.10, 0.23]). There was no increase in IRs between the ST and cumulative periods for hospitalized, opportunistic or tuberculosis infections. The IRs of overall malignancy, combined lymphomas and lung cancers did not increase in the cumulative versus the ST periods; the most common malignancies in the cumulative period were basal cell carcinoma (IR: 0.46 [0.36, 0.58]), squamous cell carcinoma (IR: 0.15 [0.09, 0.22]), breast cancer (IR: 0.12 [0.07, 0.19]) and squamous cell carcinoma of the skin (0.08 [0.04, 0.14]). The IR of autoimmune AEs during the cumulative period was comparable to the ST period, the most common event being psoriasis (IR: 0.51 [0.40, 0.63]). (Table presented) Conclusion: Based on the cumulative short-term and long-term exposure of 6028 patients to IV or SC abatacept (16,670.56 pt-yrs), the incidence rates and events reported with long-term abatacept treatment were similar to those reported in the short-term, with no increase in rate for any event with increasing exposure. These findings demonstrate that IV and SC abatacept are both well tolerated over the long-term."

In the last decade, it has become apparent that the clinical burden of NAFLD is not restricted to liver-related morbidity or mortality, and the majority of deaths in NAFLD patients are related to cardiovascular disease (CVD) and cancer. These findings have fuelled concerns that NAFLD may be a new, and added risk factor for extrahepatic diseases such as CVD, chronic kidney disease (CKD), colorectal cancer, endocrinopathies (including type 2 diabetes mellitus [T2DM] and thyroid dysfunction), and osteoporosis. In this review we critically appraise key studies on NAFLD-associated extrahepatic disease. There was marked heterogeneity between studies in study design (cross-sectional versus prospective; sample size; presence/absence of well-defined controls), population (ethnic diversity; community-based versus hospital-based cohorts), and method of NAFLD diagnosis (liver enzymes versus imaging versus biopsy). Taking this into account, the cumulative evidence to date suggests that individuals with NAFLD (specifically, nonalcoholic steatohepatitis) harbor an increased and independent risk of developing CVD, T2DM, CKD, and colorectal neoplasms. We propose future studies are necessary to better understand these risks, and suggest an example of a screening strategy.

NASH is a progressive liver disease that increases the risk of cirrhosis and end-stage liver disease. Interestingly, the global health risk of NAFLD is not confined to the liver. Compared with those without NAFLD, patients with NAFLD exhibit not only increased liver-related complications and liver-related mortality but also increased risk of developing type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease (CVD) and chronic kidney disease, increased risk of post-operative complications after major liver surgery, and increased risk of developing certain malignancies, including primary liver cancer and colorectal cancer. In this review, we discuss the current evidence linking NAFLD with the risk of CVD in the setting of the more complex scenario of other hepatic and extra-hepatic complications that may occur during the natural course of NAFLD. Moreover, we provide a brief description of the putative biological mechanisms underlying such complications, particular emphasis being given to CVD.

491,2103,2712,Cardiovascular and systemic risk in nonalcoholic fatty liver disease - atherosclerosis as a major player in the natural course of NAFLD.,Lonardo A; Sookoian S; Chonchol M; Loria P; Targher G,,"Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) encompasses pure steatosis through nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) and is the most common cause of chronic liver disease in Western countries. NASH is a progressive liver disease that increases the risk of cirrhosis and end-stage liver disease. Interestingly, the global health risk of NAFLD is not confined to the liver. Compared with those without NAFLD, patients with NAFLD exhibit not only increased liver-related complications and liver-related mortality but also increased risk of developing type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease (CVD) and chronic kidney disease, increased risk of post-operative complications after major liver surgery, and increased risk of developing certain malignancies, including primary liver cancer and colorectal cancer. In this review, we discuss the current evidence linking NAFLD with the risk of CVD in the setting of the more complex scenario of other hepatic and extra-hepatic complications that may occur during the natural course of NAFLD. Moreover, we provide a brief description of the putative biological mechanisms underlying such complications, particular emphasis being given to CVD. We conclude that NAFLD is a complex health problem with implications far beyond the liver. Hence, it may cause a significant global health burden and the assistance of patients with NAFLD impacts on the work of physicians from many different medical specialties."

Obesity and metabolic syndrome are associated with an increased cancer risk, and recent evidence demonstrated an association between NAFLD and colorectal cancer (CRC). The mechanism of how NAFLD can be associated with increased risk of CRC is not fully understood; however, NAFLD represents a condition of profound insulin resistance and a proinflammatory state. Insulin and insulin-like growth factors may promote the development of CRC through their proliferative and antiapoptotic effects. Patients with NAFLD have reduced expression of adiponectin, an adipokine with anti-inflammatory effects. Importantly, hypoadiponectinemia is associated with an increased risk of CRC. Decreased levels of adiponectin lead to increased insulin levels due to marked insulin resistance and in turn increased insulin growth factor-1 (IGF-1). Insulin binds to IGF-1 receptors and plays an important role in cell proliferation, apoptosis, and increased production of vascular endothelial growth factor, an angiogenic factor that supports cancer growth. Further studies are needed to establish (i) the pathophysiology of NAFLD with colorectal cancer, (ii) the benefit of early screening of CRC in NAFLD patients, and (iii) the impact of treatment of NAFLD in the modulation of the risk of colorectal cancer. © 2012 Said O.

Furthermore, with subcutaneous (SC) biologicals, some patients (pts) may experience injection-site reactions (ISRs), such as burning and stinging. Integrated analyses of clinical trial data are important to monitor these events over the long term. Here, we investigate such events using integrated clinical trial data of SC abatacept in a large group of pts with RA refractory to traditional DMARDs Methods: Data from the short- and long-term periods of five SC abatacept RA clinical trials were pooled; one Phase IIa, two Phase IIIb randomized controlled trials (ACQUIRE, ALLOW), and two Phase IIIb open-label studies (ATTUNE, ACCOMPANY). Safety events were assessed for pts who received ≥1 dose of SC abatacept (125 mg/ week fixed dose). Overall and 6-monthly (up to Month 24) incidence rates (IRs) were calculated as number of pts with events per 100 ptyears (pt-yrs) of exposure, with 95% CIs. IRs post Month 24 are not shown due to low pt numbers at time of data analysis. Results: The analysis included 1879 pts with 3086 pt-yrs of exposure. Mean (range) exposure was 20 (2-56) months; 1191 pts had >18 months of exposure. Serious infections occurred at an IR (95% CI) of 1.94 (1.50-2.50), in 59 (3.1%) pts; the most frequent (IR >0.10) were pneumonia (0.36 [0.20-0.65]), urinary tract infection (0.16 [0.07-0.39]) and gastroenteritis (0.13 [0.05-0.35]). TB, pulmonary TB and peritoneal TB were recorded in 1 pt each (0.03 [0.00-0.23] each). Malignancies excluding non-melanoma skin cancer occurred at an IR of 0.68 (0.45- 1.05) in 21 (1.1%) pts. The most frequent (IR >0.10) malignancies were basal cell carcinoma (0.46 [0.27-0.77]), breast cancer and squamous cell carcinoma of skin (0.16 [0.07-0.39] each). Autoimmune events occurred with an IR of 1.28 (0.93-1.75) in 39 (2.1%) pts. The most frequent (IR >0.10) autoimmune events were psoriasis (0.29 [0.15- 0.56]) and Sjö gren's syndrome (0.19 [0.09-0.43]). IRs of serious infections, malignancies and autoimmune events did not increase with increasing exposure. ISRs occurred with an IR of 2.22 (1.74-2.82) in 66 (3.5%) pts; the most frequent were erythema, haematoma, pain and pruritus (0.46 [0.27-0.77] each). Events were mostly (94%) mild in intensity; 2 pts discontinued due to ISRs. ISRs mainly occurred during the first 6 months. Conclusions: These pooled safety data, from 1879 pts with up to 4.5 yrs of treatment and 3086 pt-yrs of exposure, demonstrate that longterm treatment with SC abatacept is well tolerated, and does not lead to an increase in infections, malignancies or autoimmune events over time."

Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is regarded as a hepatic manifestation of metabolic syndrome. We investigated whether NAFLD is associated with colorectal neoplasms in Korean women. Methods: This retrospective cohort study included data from 5517 women, aged 35-80years, who underwent life insurance company health examinations between July 2002 and June 2006. Fatty liver disease was assessed by abdominal ultrasound, with NAFLD defined as fatty liver disease in the absence of alcohol use of >40g/week or other secondary causes. The incidence of colorectal neoplasms through December 2008 was obtained through medical certificate codes for insurance claims. The association between NAFLD and the risk of colorectal neoplasms was estimated using standard Cox proportional hazards models. Results: Of the study population, 15.1% were diagnosed with NAFLD. During follow-up, 65 women were verified as having adenomatous polyps and 15 as having colorectal cancer. Adjusted relative risks (95% confidence interval [CI]) for adenomatous polyps by age, low high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol, and NAFLD were 1.12 (95% CI 1.09-1.15), 2.56 (95% CI 1.53-4.28) and 1.94 (95% CI 1.11-3.40).

We sought to determine the relevance of this target in RC patients treated with neoadjuvant radiation or chemoradiation. Methods: Using a retrospective cohort design, we included all RC patients treated with curative surgery from 1993 to 2003. Patients who received neoadjuvant therapy and surgery (NEO) were compared to patients who had surgery alone (SURG). LN assessment was compared between groups in univariate and multivariable analyses. The impact of node retrieval and NEO on node-positivity and disease-specific survival (DSS) was assessed. Results: A total of 708 patients were identified, of whom 429 (61%) were in the NEO group (18 radiation, 411 chemoradiation). These patients had significantly fewer nodes assessed than SURG patients in univariable (mean 10.8 vs 15.5, P < 0.0001) and multivariable analyses (adjusted mean difference: )5.0 nodes, P < 0.0001). In the NEO group, 63% of patients had < 12 nodes retrieved (P < 0.0001 compared to SURG group). The proportion of patients diagnosed with node-positive disease in the NEO group was significantly and monotonically associated with the number of lymph nodes retrieved (P = 0.009), with no plateau in the relationship. Fewer nodes retrieved was not associated with inferior disease-specific survival for either node-negative or node-positive patients. In contrast, pathologic T-stage, was independently associated with node retrieval (P = 0.009), nodepositivity (OR: 2.3, P = 0.0007), and DSS (HR: 2.1, P = 0.0003). Conclusions: In the setting of a tertiary cancer center, the 12 LN threshold is not relevant and often not achievable in RC patients treated with neoadjuvant therapy. The lower LN counts resulting from neoadjuvant treatment was not associated with understaging or with inferior survival. Although we support the critical importance of careful pathological examination and adequate nodal staging, our findings challenge the relevance of LN count both in clinical practice and as a quality indicator in rectal cancer."

This study aimed to assess the incidence and risk factors of the development of fatty liver disease, resulting from tamoxifen use, in females with breast cancer. Patients and methods: Seventy females aged between 28 and 80. years with breast cancer were recruited from Shahid Sadoughi Clinic, Yazd, Iran in 2006-2008. The patients underwent chemotherapy followed by 20. mg tamoxifen daily as postoperative endocrine treatment. Only in patients with normal baseline liver function, negative test for hepatitis C virus (HCV) and hepatitis B surface antigen (HbsAg) and normal liver ultrasonography were included. The development of fatty changes over a 6-months period of treatment was the main outcome measurement assessed by ultrasonography. Results: Thirty-five of 70 patients developed fatty change during follow-up, in which nine were in grade one, 20 in grade two and six patients in grade three. Risk factors associated with the development of fatty change were elevation of triglycerides (2.4, 1.2-4.8), elevation of fasting blood sugar (FBS) and low high-density lipoprotein (HDL) (3.4, 1.4-7.8). No relation was found between the development of fatty change and age (1.3, 0.87-2.00), menopause (1.13, 0.69-1.9), previous history of diabetes (2.4, 0.7-8.4), previous chemotherapy regimen and receptors type (c-erbB2, P53, progesterone receptor (PR), oestrogen receptor (ER)) and stage of breast cancer. Further, there was no relation between the development of fatty change and hypercholesterolemia, low-density lipoprotein (LDL), arterial hypertension and body mass index (BMI). Conclusion: Tamoxifen was associated with a high risk of development of non-alcoholic steatohepatitis in patients with higher triglycerides and FBS and lower HDL. However, no relationship was found with the level of BMI, LDL, hypertension, overweight and obesity. © 2011 Arab Journal of Gastroenterology."

NASH is associated with obesity and diabetes. The condition also may be associated with some medications, including tamoxifen. Early case reports and small series have documented NASH in patients who received tamoxifen. METHODS: The records of patients registered in the St. Vincent Hospital Cancer Registry of Green Bay Wisconsin from January 1, 1992 to December 31, 2000 were reviewed. RESULTS: In total, 1105 patients with breast cancer were evaluated for NASH, and 24 cases of NASH were documented (2.2%). Seven patients had NASH before their diagnosis of breast cancer, and 17 patients developed NASH after their diagnosis of breast cancer. In multivariate analysis, the factors associated with NASH were tamoxifen use (odds ratio [OR], 8.2; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.06-63.72), body mass index (BMI) (OR, 1.13; 95% CI, 1.06-1.20), and age (OR, 95% CI, 0.91-0.99).

This effect known as non-alcoholic fatty liver disease may be associated with the malignancy itself, drugs or some other well-known risk factors that may induce steatosis. We studied the influences of primary disease and treatment on steatosis in patients with breast cancer. Materials and methods: There were four groups of patients in our study. Group 1: 40 newly diagnosed, previously untreated breast cancer; Group 2: 45 cases of breast cancer treated with systemic therapy; Group 3: 40 cases of ovarian cancer; Group 4: 40 healthy women. Hepatic steatosis was evaluated by sonography by two radiologist, independently. We also evaluated major risk factors, biochemical findings, and influences of treatment on hepatic steatosis. Results: We detected steatosis in 63%, 72%, 77%, and 48% of patients in groups 1, 2, 3, and 4, respectively. There was a statistically significant difference only between groups 3 and 4 (P = 0.045). However, grade 2 and 3 steatosis were more frequent in breast cancer patients (group 1 and 2), compared with mild steatosis in ovarian cancer patients and healthy women. Although a good correlation was found between tamoxifen use and chemotherapy on development of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, no association of hepatic steatosis with transaminase levels was found, which might be of help for earlier detection of steatosis. AST/ALT ratio was found to have no impact on the rate of hepatic steatosis, contrary to the literature. Conclusion: Hepatic steatosis, excluding patients with grade 1 steatosis, which may be a normal variant, were more readily detected in patients with breast cancer.

Seven hundred and forty-seven patients undergoing surgical treatment for colorectal neoplasms were evaluated: the clinicopathological data of 171 patients with liver cirrhosis and 33 with fatty liver were compared to those of 543 patients without liver damage. Results. Gender, age, type of operative procedures performed and histological grading were similar in patients with or without liver damage. In patients with liver cirrhosis the incidence of stage II tumour was greater, while stage IV tumours (P<0.001) and nodal involvement were significantly lower than in patients with non injured or fatty liver (P<0.02 and P<0.001 respectively). At the time of surgery, synchronous hepatic metastases were present in 32% of patients with normal liver, in 15% of patients with fatty liver (P<0.02) and in 4.7% of patients with liver cirrhosis (P<0.001).

Recently we reported the impairment of fatty acid β-oxidation and the enhancing fatty infiltration to hepatocytes in aromatase deficiency (ArKO) mice as the estrogen deficiency models. This experimental observation let us speculate strong link between estrogen and hepatic steatosis. In this study, we investigated whether a polymorphism in the cytochrome P450c17α gene (CYP17), which is associated with circulating estrogen levels, influences the development of tamoxifen-induced hepatic steatosis. This consecutive study included 180 breast cancer patients undergoing tamoxifen treatment. Genomic DNA extracted from the peripheral blood of each patient was analyzed by restriction fragment length polymorphism (defined as the A1 and A2 alleles). The extent of hepatic steatosis was assessed by computed tomography (CT) as the liver/ spleen (L/S) ratio. While receiving adjuvant tamoxifen, 57 of 180 patients developed hepatic steatosis (L/S ratio <0.9) without obvious changes in body mass index (BMI). We observed a significant association between the A2/A2 genotype and the development of hepatic steatosis compared with the A1/A1 genotype [odds ratio (OR), 3.60; 95% confidence interval (C.I.) = 1.42-9.10]. The A1/A2 genotype was at an intermediately increased risk of hepatic steatosis (OR, 2.24; 95% C.I. = 0.99-5.08). The presence of the A2 allele possibly increased the progression of hepatic steatosis with a gene dosage effect (P = 0.06). Our results suggest that functional polymorphism in CYP17 may be involved in determining susceptibility of tamoxifen-induced hepatic steatosis. © 2005 Published by Elsevier Ireland Ltd."

The development of this complication is strongly associated with three clinical risk factors; specifically, insulin resistance, central obesity, and hypertriglyceridemia, however a genetic predisposition to THS has yet to be investigated. The aim of this study is to determine whether genetic polymorphism of the P450c17alpha enzyme coded for by the CYP17 gene, responsible for regulating serum estrogen, has an association with THS. After obtaining informed consent from 180 eligible breast cancer patients treated with tamoxifen, DNA was collected and analyzed by restriction fragment length polymorphism assay and classified into alleles defined as A1 and A2. The absence or presence and extent of THS was evaluated by calculating the liver/spleen (L/S) ratio based on Hounsfield units with a CT scanner. Administration of tamoxifen led to THS (L/S ratio <0.9) in 57 (31.7%) of 180 patients while the remaining 123 (68.3%) patients did not develop THS. A significant difference in the distribution of CYP17 genotypes was observed between patients who developed THS and those who did not (P=0.021). A significantly higher frequency of the A2 allele was seen in the THS group (odds ratio, 1.90; 95% confidence interval, 1.21-2.99). Our study provides the first evidence that CYP17 polymorphism participates in the development of THS, and sheds light on the genetic causes of this side effect and genetic differences between tamoxifen-treated individuals."

Some researchers suggest that pain may undermine compliance with screening mammography. As a part of a quality improvement project, we have surveyed women undergoing mammography in 2 centers in Jerusalem to identify the prevalence, severity, and duration of mammography-associated pain, demographic risk factors, and the degree that this may undermine compliance with breast cancer screening. A 23-item questionnaire was administered to 399 women (32% at the Shaare Zedek Medical Center [SZMC] and 68% at the Rachel Nash Comprehensive Breast Clinic [HALA]). Of the total, 77% of the women reported that the procedure was painful. Of those reporting pain, 60% described pain intensity as moderate or severe. In 67%, the pain resolved within 10 minutes. By univariate analysis, the only significant predictor for pain during mammography was cyclic breast pain (P = 0.053). No significant correlation was identified for age, breast size, pre-mammography counseling, and examination center (SZMC vs. HALA). The prevalence of pre-mammography counseling or explanation was low (51%). Despite that, 61% of the respondents expected that mammography would be painful. Indeed, most of those who anticipated pain reported that the actual severity was not greater than the anticipated severity. Even among women who reported pain of moderate or greater severity, less than 5% expressed preference to receive pre-emptive analgesia prior to their next mammogram. A substantial minority of women acknowledged that the experience of their mammography invoked reactions that may impend future compliance; 26% reported anxiety and 12% reported pain as factors that may interfere with ongoing compliance with regular mammographic screening. These data serve to emphasize the need for appropriate pre-test counseling and suggest a possible role for post-test debriefing to address those factors which may interfere with future test compliance. © 2003 U.S. Cancer Pain Relief Committee.

528,2538,2837,Does mammography hurt?,Sapir R; Patlas M; Strano SD; Hadas-Halpern I; Cherny NI,,"The documented incidence of pain associated with screening mammography varies from 1% to 62%. Some researchers suggest that pain may undermine compliance with screening mammography. As a part of a quality improvement project, we have surveyed women undergoing mammography in 2 centers in Jerusalem to identify the prevalence, severity, and duration of mammography-associated pain, demographic risk factors, and the degree that this may undermine compliance with breast cancer screening. A 23-item questionnaire was administered to 399 women (32% at the Shaare Zedek Medical Center [SZMC] and 68% at the Rachel Nash Comprehensive Breast Clinic [HALA]). Of the total, 77% of the women reported that the procedure was painful. Of those reporting pain, 60% described pain intensity as moderate or severe. In 67%, the pain resolved within 10 minutes. By univariate analysis, the only significant predictor for pain during mammography was cyclic breast pain (P = 0.053). No significant correlation was identified for age, breast size, pre-mammography counseling, and examination center (SZMC vs. HALA). The prevalence of pre-mammography counseling or explanation was low (51%). Despite that, 61% of the respondents expected that mammography would be painful. Indeed, most of those who anticipated pain reported that the actual severity was not greater than the anticipated severity. Even among women who reported pain of moderate or greater severity, less than 5% expressed preference to receive pre-emptive analgesia prior to their next mammogram. A substantial minority of women acknowledged that the experience of their mammography invoked reactions that may impend future compliance; 26% reported anxiety and 12% reported pain as factors that may interfere with ongoing compliance with regular mammographic screening.

We investigated the following breast cancer patients: 13 receiving no tamoxifen (group A), 13 receiving tamoxifen 40 mg daily but without fatty liver (group B), and 13 receiving tamoxifen 40 mg daily with fatty liver (group C). Plasma lipids and diameter of LDL particles were measured. Susceptibility of LDL to oxidation was analyzed by incubation with CuSO4 while monitoring conjugated diene formation and assaying thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS). Plasma total and LDL cholesterol concentrations in groups B and C were significantly lower than those in group A. In group C, concentrations of plasma triglyceride (TG) and TBARS were significantly greater, but LDL particle diameter and lag time for LDL oxidation were significantly smaller than those in groups A and B. Plasma TG concentrations correlated negatively with computed tomography ratio of liver to spleen (r = -0.76; P < 0.001). LDL particle diameter correlated negatively with plasma TG (r = -0.62; P < 0.001) and TBARS (r = -0.44; P < 0.01), but positively with LDL lag time (r = 0.47; P < 0.01) Tamoxifen-reduced fatty liver in breast cancer patients may be atherogenic, via increased TG and consequent small, easily oxidized LDL particles."

Massive hepatic steatosis is an example of its side effects. Here we show risk factors for the development of massive hepatic steatosis and describe a representative clinical course of these patients treated with fibrates for the first time. Methods: Computed tomography (CT) numbers of the liver and spleen were measured and correlated to body mass index (BMI) and pregnanetriol/pregnanediol ratio in urine (P3/P2 ratio). Patients: We enrolled 56 premenopausal women treated with breast conservation treatment. They received oral tamoxifen (40 mg/day for 2 to 3 years) as adjuvant endocrine therapy with systemic chemotherapy. Results: Serum estradiol level in 48 of 56 patients treated with tamoxifen was less than 10 pg/ml. The ratio of hepatic CT number to splenic CT number<0.9 was related to increased BMI (>23.6 kg/sqm) and reduced P3/P2 ratio (<1). Fibrates are potent enough to improve hepatic steatosis in tamoxifen-induced hepatic steatosis. Conclusion: P3/P2 ratio<1 was related to sufficient blockade of estrogen receptor proven by the development of massive hepatic steatosis. Therefore, we propose that tamoxifen is not a mere antagonist of estrogen, but it may also suppress estrogen synthesis when estrogen receptor is blocked sufficiently. The undetectable level of serum estrogen in tamoxifen-treated premenopausal women may partially explain why tamoxifen was so effective in estrogen receptor-positive early breast cancer."

Methods: Six patients with hepatic tumors (metastases from colon cancer, n = 3; breast cancer, n = 2; hepatocellular carcinoma, n = 1) were examined. In-phase (IP) and opposed-phase (OP) T1-weighted spoiled gradient-echo images were obtained. CT during arterial portography (CTAP) and CT during hepatic arteriography (CTHA) were also performed. Pathologic confirmation was obtained in three patients with metastases from colon cancer. Results: In all six patients, peritumoral ringlike or wedge-shaped hyperintense areas in relation to the tumor and the surrounding steatotic liver parenchyma were clearly visualized on OP images alone. This area appeared as a perfusion defect on CTAP and ringlike or wedge-shaped enhancement on CTHA. Pathologically, the peritumoral hyperintense areas on OP images were compatible with the spared area of fatty liver. Conclusion: A peritumoral spared area can be demonstrated with OP images. The etiology of the phenomenon is correlated with decreased portal flow and increased arterial flow in the peritumoral hepatic parenchyma."

The remaining 718 non-fatty liver patients with colorectal cancer (NFL group) were compared to the FL group regarding clinicopathological aspects. Results: (1) There were only true patients who had liver metastasis in the FL group (1.7%), while the NFL group included 115 patients with liver metastasis (16.0%) (p < 0.01). (2) The five-year survival rate of the FL group was 95.7%, which was significantly higher than that in the NFL group (9.8%) (p < 0.001). (3) In the multivariate analysis, the fatty liver was identified as an independent prognostic factor. Conclusions: The FL group had a much better prognosis compared to the NFL group.
