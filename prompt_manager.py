- Population: {population}
- Intervention: {intervention}
- Comparison: {comparison}
- Outcome: {outcome}
- Study Design: {study_design}

Input abstracts:

Each article in the input contains:
- index: article identifier
- abstract: the text to analyze

IMPORTANT: You must follow these strict JSON formatting rules:
1. Use double quotes for all strings
2. Ensure all strings are properly terminated
3. Use commas between array items and object properties
4. Do not use trailing commas
5. Keep the response concise and avoid unnecessary whitespace
6. Escape any special characters in strings
7. Use true/false (not True/False) for boolean values

Your task is to rigorously scrutinize Model A's analysis and provide your own assessment.
You should actively look for potential flaws or oversights in Model A's analysis, while maintaining a high standard of evidence-based evaluation.

  - A_Decision: Model A's inclusion decision
  - A_Reason: Model A's explanation

Your task is to:
1. Thoroughly examine the original abstract
2. Critically review Model A's PICOS extraction, actively seeking potential issues:
   - Look for missing details or nuances in population characteristics
   - Check for precise intervention specifications
   - Verify completeness of comparison group description
   - Examine outcome measurements and their relevance
   - Scrutinize study design classification
3. Provide corrections with evidence from the abstract:
   - B_P: Your corrected population description (use "-" only if A_P is completely accurate)
   - B_I: Your corrected intervention description (use "-" only if A_I is completely accurate)
   - B_C: Your corrected comparison description (use "-" only if A_C is completely accurate)
   - B_O: Your corrected outcome description (use "-" only if A_O is completely accurate)
   - B_S: Your corrected study design description (use "-" only if A_S is completely accurate)
4. Make your own independent inclusion decision (B_Decision)
5. Provide detailed reasoning (B_Reason) that:
   - Points out any oversights or inaccuracies in Model A's analysis
   - Cites specific evidence from the abstract
   - Explains why your corrections or agreements are justified

IMPORTANT: You must follow these strict JSON formatting rules:
1. Use double quotes for all strings

3. Use commas between array items and object properties
4. Do not use trailing commas
5. Keep the response concise and avoid unnecessary whitespace
6. Escape any special characters in strings
7. Use true/false for B_Decision (true means the article should be included)
8. ALL fields (B_P, B_I, B_C, B_O, B_S) must be provided for each review
9. NEVER omit any field, even if you agree with Model A's analysis
