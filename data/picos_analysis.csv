We aimed to assess the efficacy of adjuvant atezolizumab plus bevacizumab versus active surveillance in patients with high-risk hepatocellular carcinoma. METHODS: In the global, open-label, phase 3 IMbrave050 study, adult patients with high-risk surgically resected or ablated hepatocellular carcinoma were recruited from 134 hospitals and medical centres in 26 countries in four WHO regions (European region, region of the Americas, South-East Asia region, and Western Pacific region). Patients were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio via an interactive voice-web response system using permuted blocks, using a block size of 4, to receive intravenous 1200 mg atezolizumab plus 15 mg/kg bevacizumab every 3 weeks for 17 cycles (12 months) or to active surveillance. The primary endpoint was recurrence-free survival by independent review facility assessment in the intention-to-treat population. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04102098. FINDINGS: The intention-to-treat population included 668 patients randomly assigned between Dec 31, 2019, and Nov 25, 2021, to either atezolizumab plus bevacizumab (n=334) or to active surveillance (n=334). At the prespecified interim analysis (Oct 21, 2022), median duration of follow-up was 17·4 months (IQR 13·9-22·1). Adjuvant atezolizumab plus bevacizumab was associated with significantly improved recurrence-free survival (median, not evaluable [NE]; [95% CI 22·1-NE]) compared with active surveillance (median, NE [21·4-NE]; hazard ratio, 0·72 [adjusted 95% CI 0·53-0·98]; p=0·012). Grade 3 or 4 adverse events occurred in 136 (41%) of 332 patients who received atezolizumab plus bevacizumab and 44 (13%) of 330 patients in the active surveillance group. Grade 5 adverse events occurred in six patients (2%, two of which were treatment related) in the atezolizumab plus bevacizumab group, and one patient (<1%) in the active surveillance group. Both atezolizumab and bevacizumab were discontinued because of adverse events in 29 patients (9%) who received atezolizumab plus bevacizumab. INTERPRETATION: Among patients at high risk of hepatocellular carcinoma recurrence following curative-intent resection or ablation, recurrence-free survival was improved in those who received atezolizumab plus bevacizumab versus active surveillance. To our knowledge, IMbrave050 is the first phase 3 study of adjuvant treatment for hepatocellular carcinoma to report positive results. However, longer follow-up for both recurrence-free and overall survival is needed to assess the benefit-risk profile more fully.

1,"Pembrolizumab in combination with gemcitabine and cisplatin compared with gemcitabine and cisplatin alone for patients with advanced biliary tract cancer (KEYNOTE-966): a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 3 trial.",Kelley RK; Ueno M; Yoo C; Finn RS; Furuse J; Ren Z; Yau T; Klümpen HJ; Chan SL; Ozaka M; Verslype C; Bouattour M; Park JO; Barajas O; Pelzer U; Valle JW; Yu L; Malhotra U; Siegel AB; Edeline J; Vogel A,"BACKGROUND: Biliary tract cancers, which arise from the intrahepatic or extrahepatic bile ducts and the gallbladder, generally have a poor prognosis and are rising in incidence worldwide. The standard-of-care treatment for advanced biliary tract cancer is chemotherapy with gemcitabine and cisplatin. Because most biliary tract cancers have an immune-suppressed microenvironment, immune checkpoint inhibitor monotherapy is associated with a low objective response rate. We aimed to assess whether adding the immune checkpoint inhibitor pembrolizumab to gemcitabine and cisplatin would improve outcomes compared with gemcitabine and cisplatin alone in patients with advanced biliary tract cancer. METHODS: KEYNOTE-966 was a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 3 trial done at 175 medical centres globally. Eligible participants were aged 18 years or older; had previously untreated, unresectable, locally advanced or metastatic biliary tract cancer; had disease measurable per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumours version 1.1; and had an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0 or 1. Eligible participants were randomly assigned (1:1) to pembrolizumab 200 mg or placebo, both administered intravenously every 3 weeks (maximum 35 cycles), in combination with gemcitabine (1000 mg/m(2) intravenously on days 1 and 8 every 3 weeks; no maximum duration) and cisplatin (25 mg/m(2) intravenously on days 1 and 8 every 3 weeks; maximum 8 cycles). Randomisation was done using a central interactive voice-response system and stratified by geographical region, disease stage, and site of origin in block sizes of four. The primary endpoint of overall survival was evaluated in the intention-to-treat population. The secondary endpoint of safety was evaluated in the as-treated population. This study is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04003636. FINDINGS: Between Oct 4, 2019, and June 8, 2021, 1564 patients were screened for eligibility, 1069 of whom were randomly assigned to pembrolizumab plus gemcitabine and cisplatin (pembrolizumab group; n=533) or placebo plus gemcitabine and cisplatin (placebo group; n=536). Median study follow-up at final analysis was 25·6 months (IQR 21·7-30·4). Median overall survival was 12·7 months (95% CI 11·5-13·6) in the pembrolizumab group versus 10·9 months (9·9-11·6) in the placebo group (hazard ratio 0·83 [95% CI 0·72-0·95]; one-sided p=0·0034 [significance threshold, p=0·0200]). In the as-treated population, the maximum adverse event grade was 3 to 4 in 420 (79%) of 529 participants in the pembrolizumab group and 400 (75%) of 534 in the placebo group; 369 (70%) participants in the pembrolizumab group and 367 (69%) in the placebo group had treatment-related adverse events with a maximum grade of 3 to 4. 31 (6%) participants in the pembrolizumab group and 49 (9%) in the placebo group died due to adverse events, including eight (2%) in the pembrolizumab group and three (1%) in the placebo group who died due to treatment-related adverse events. INTERPRETATION: Based on a statistically significant, clinically meaningful improvement in overall survival compared with gemcitabine and cisplatin without any new safety signals, pembrolizumab plus gemcitabine and cisplatin could be a new treatment option for patients with previously untreated metastatic or unresectable biliary tract cancer.

2,Four-year overall survival update from the phase III HIMALAYA study of tremelimumab plus durvalumab in unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma.,Sangro B; Chan SL; Kelley RK; Lau G; Kudo M; Sukeepaisarnjaroen W; Yarchoan M; De Toni EN; Furuse J; Kang YK; Galle PR; Rimassa L; Heurgué A; Tam VC; Van Dao T; Thungappa SC; Breder V; Ostapenko Y; Reig M; Makowsky M; Paskow MJ; Gupta C; Kurland JF; Negro A; Abou-Alfa GK,"BACKGROUND: In the phase III HIMALAYA study (NCT03298451) in unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (uHCC), STRIDE (Single Tremelimumab Regular Interval Durvalumab) significantly improved overall survival (OS) versus sorafenib; durvalumab monotherapy was noninferior to sorafenib for OS. Results reported herein are from a 4-year updated OS analysis of HIMALAYA. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Participants with uHCC and no previous systemic treatment were randomized to STRIDE (n = 393), durvalumab (n = 389), or sorafenib (n = 389). The updated data cut-off was 23 January 2023. OS and serious adverse events (AEs) were assessed. Additionally, baseline characteristics and subsequent therapies were analyzed in long-term survivors (≥36 months beyond randomization). RESULTS: For STRIDE, durvalumab, and sorafenib, median [95% confidence interval (CI)] follow-up was 49.12 months (46.95-50.17 months), 48.46 months (46.82-49.81 months), and 47.31 months (45.08-49.15 months), respectively. OS hazard ratio (95% CI) for STRIDE versus sorafenib was 0.78 (0.67-0.92). The 36-month OS rate for STRIDE was 30.7% versus 19.8% for sorafenib. The 48-month OS rate remained higher for STRIDE at 25.2%, versus 15.1% for sorafenib. The long-term OS benefit of STRIDE was observed across clinically relevant subgroups and was further improved in participants who achieved disease control. Long-term survivors with STRIDE (n = 103) included participants across clinically relevant subgroups, and 57.3% (59/103) had no reported subsequent anticancer therapy. No new serious treatment-related AEs occurred with STRIDE from the primary analysis (17.5%; 68/388). Durvalumab maintained OS noninferiority to sorafenib and no late-onset safety signals were identified. CONCLUSIONS: These data represent the longest follow-up to date in phase III studies in uHCC. The unprecedented 3- and 4-year OS rates reinforce the sustained long-term OS benefit of STRIDE versus sorafenib. STRIDE maintained a tolerable yet differentiated safety profile from other current uHCC therapies.

Therefore, a clinical study was conducted to compare the efficacy and safety of the anti-PD-1 antibody camrelizumab plus the VEGFR2-targeted TKI rivoceranib (also known as apatinib) versus sorafenib as first-line treatment for unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma. METHODS: This randomised, open-label, international phase 3 trial (CARES-310) was done at 95 study sites across 13 countries and regions worldwide. Patients with unresectable or metastatic hepatocellular carcinoma who had not previously received any systemic treatment were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive either camrelizumab 200 mg intravenously every 2 weeks plus rivoceranib 250 mg orally once daily or sorafenib 400 mg orally twice daily. Randomisation was done via a centralised interactive response system. The primary endpoints were progression-free survival, as assessed by the blinded independent review committee per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumours version 1.1, and overall survival in the intention-to-treat population. Safety was assessed in all patients who received at least one dose of the study drugs. We report the findings from the prespecified primary analysis for progression-free survival and interim analysis for overall survival. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT03764293). FINDINGS: Between June 28, 2019, and March 24, 2021, 543 patients were randomly assigned to the camrelizumab-rivoceranib (n=272) or sorafenib (n=271) group. At the primary analysis for progression-free survival (May 10, 2021), median follow-up was 7·8 months (IQR 4·1-10·6). Median progression-free survival was significantly improved with camrelizumab-rivoceranib versus sorafenib (5·6 months [95% CI 5·5-6·3] vs 3·7 months [2·8-3·7]; hazard ratio [HR] 0·52 [95% CI 0·41-0·65]; one-sided p<0·0001). At the interim analysis for overall survival (Feb 8, 2022), median follow-up was 14·5 months (IQR 9·1-18·7). Median overall survival was significantly extended with camrelizumab-rivoceranib versus sorafenib (22·1 months [95% CI 19·1-27·2] vs 15·2 months [13·0-18·5]; HR 0·62 [95% CI 0·49-0·80]; one-sided p<0·0001). The most common grade 3 or 4 treatment-related adverse events were hypertension (102 [38%] of 272 patients in the camrelizumab-rivoceranib group vs 40 [15%] of 269 patients in the sorafenib group), palmar-plantar erythrodysaesthesia syndrome (33 [12%] vs 41 [15%]), increased aspartate aminotransferase (45 [17%] vs 14 [5%]), and increased alanine aminotransferase (35 [13%] vs eight [3%]). Treatment-related serious adverse events were reported in 66 (24%) patients in the camrelizumab-rivoceranib group and 16 (6%) in the sorafenib group. Treatment-related death occurred in two patients: one patient in the camrelizumab-rivoceranib group (ie, multiple organ dysfunction syndrome) and one patient in the sorafenib group (ie, respiratory failure and circulatory collapse). INTERPRETATION: Camrelizumab plus rivoceranib showed a statistically significant and clinically meaningful benefit in progression-free survival and overall survival compared with sorafenib for patients with unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma, presenting as a new and effective first-line treatment option for this population.

4,Camrelizumab (a PD-1 inhibitor) plus apatinib (an VEGFR-2 inhibitor) and hepatic artery infusion chemotherapy for hepatocellular carcinoma in Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer stage C (TRIPLET): a phase II study.,Zhang TQ; Geng ZJ; Zuo MX; Li JB; Huang JH; Huang ZL; Wu PH; Gu YK,"Hepatic arterial infusion chemotherapy (HAIC) using a combination of oxaliplatin, fluorouracil, and leucovorin (FOLFOX) has shown promise for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients classified under Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC) stage C. In China, the combined therapy of camrelizumab and apatinib is now an approved first-line approach for inoperable HCC. This study (NCT04191889) evaluated the benefit of combining camrelizumab and apatinib with HAIC-FOLFOX for HCC patients in BCLC stage C. Eligible patients were given a maximum of six cycles of HAIC-FOLFOX, along with camrelizumab and apatinib, until either disease progression or intolerable toxicities emerged. The primary outcome measured was the objective response rate (ORR) based on the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) v1.1. Thirty-five patients were enrolled. Based on RECIST v1.1 criteria, the confirmed ORR stood at 77.1% (95% CI: 59.9% to 89.6%), with a disease control rate of 97.1% (95% CI: 85.1% to 99.9%). The median progression-free survival was 10.38 months (95% CI: 7.79 to 12.45).

5,Tislelizumab vs Sorafenib as First-Line Treatment for Unresectable Hepatocellular Carcinoma: A Phase 3 Randomized Clinical Trial.,Qin S; Kudo M; Meyer T; Bai Y; Guo Y; Meng Z; Satoh T; Marino D; Assenat E; Li S; Chen Y; Boisserie F; Abdrashitov R; Finn RS; Vogel A; Zhu AX,"IMPORTANCE: Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a leading cause of cancer-related mortality, and additional first-line treatments are needed. The programmed cell death protein 1 inhibitor tislelizumab demonstrated efficacy and a tolerable safety profile as second-line HCC treatment. OBJECTIVE: To investigate efficacy and safety of tislelizumab vs sorafenib tosylate for first-line treatment of unresectable HCC. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: The open-label, global, multiregional phase 3 RATIONALE-301 randomized clinical trial enrolled systemic therapy-naive adults with histologically confirmed HCC, Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer stage B or C disease, disease progression following (or patient was not amenable to) locoregional therapy, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 1 or less, and Child-Pugh class A, between December 27, 2017, and October 2, 2019. Data cutoff was July 11, 2022. INTERVENTION: Patients were randomized 1:1 to receive tislelizumab, 200 mg intravenously every 3 weeks, or sorafenib tosylate, 400 mg orally twice daily. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary end point was overall survival (OS); secondary end points included objective response rate, progression-free survival, duration of response, and safety. RESULTS: A total of 674 patients were included in the analysis (570 men [84.6%]; median age, 61 years [range, 23-86 years]). As of July 11, 2022, minimum study follow-up was 33 months. The primary end point of OS noninferiority of tislelizumab vs sorafenib was met in the intention-to-treat population (n = 674); median overall survival was 15.9 (95% CI, 13.2-19.7) months vs 14.1 (95% CI, 12.6-17.4) months, respectively (hazard ratio [HR], 0.85 [95.003% CI, 0.71-1.02]), and superiority of tislelizumab vs sorafenib was not met. The objective response rate was 14.3% (n = 49) for tislelizumab vs 5.4% (n = 18) for sorafenib, and median duration of response was 36.1 (95% CI, 16.8 to not evaluable) months vs 11.0 (95% CI, 6.2-14.7) months, respectively. Median progression-free survival was 2.1 (95% CI, 2.1-3.5) months vs 3.4 (95% CI, 2.2-4.1) months with tislelizumab vs sorafenib (HR, 1.11 [95% CI, 0.92-1.33]). The incidence of treatment-emergent adverse events (AEs) was 96.2% (325 of 338 patients) for tislelizumab and 100% (n = 324) for sorafenib. Grade 3 or greater treatment-related AEs were reported in 75 patients (22.2%) receiving tislelizumab and 173 (53.4%) receiving sorafenib. There was a lower incidence of treatment-related AEs leading to drug discontinuation (21 [6.2%] vs 33 [10.2%]) and drug modification (68 [20.1%] vs 187 [57.7%]) with tislelizumab vs sorafenib. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In RATIONALE-301, tislelizumab demonstrated OS benefit that was noninferior vs sorafenib, with a higher objective response rate and more durable responses, while median progression-free survival was longer with sorafenib.

6,Association between Liver MRI Proton Density Fat Fraction and Liver Disease Risk.,Xia T; Du M; Li H; Wang Y; Zha J; Wu T; Ju S,"Background A better understanding of the association between liver MRI proton density fat fraction (PDFF) and liver diseases might support the clinical implementation of MRI PDFF. Purpose To quantify the genetically predicted causal effect of liver MRI PDFF on liver disease risk. Materials and Methods This population-based prospective observational study used summary-level data mainly from the UK Biobank and FinnGen. Mendelian randomization analysis was conducted using the inverse variance-weighted method to explore the causal association between genetically predicted liver MRI PDFF and liver disease risk with Bonferroni correction. The individual-level data were downloaded between August and December 2020 from the UK Biobank. Logistic regression analysis was performed to validate the association between liver MRI PDFF polygenic risk score and liver disease risk. Mediation analyses were performed using multivariable mendelian randomization. Results Summary-level and individual-level data were obtained from 32 858 participants and 378 436 participants (mean age, 57 years ± 8 [SD]; 203 108 female participants), respectively. Genetically predicted high liver MRI PDFF was associated with increased risks of malignant liver neoplasm (odds ratio [OR], 4.5; P < .001), alcoholic liver disease (OR, 1.9; P < .001), fibrosis and cirrhosis of the liver (OR, 3.0; P < .004), fibrosis of the liver (OR, 3.6; P = .002), cirrhosis of the liver (OR, 3.8; P < .001), nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (OR, 7.7; P < .001), and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) (OR, 4.4; P < .001). Individual-level evidence supported these associations after grouping participants based on liver MRI PDFF polygenic risk score (all P < .004). The mediation analysis indicated that genetically predicted high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and waist-to-hip ratio (mediation effects, 25.1%-46.3%) were related to the occurrence of fibrosis and cirrhosis of the liver, cirrhosis of the liver, and NAFLD at liver MRI PDFF (all P < .05). Conclusion This study provided evidence of the association between genetically predicted liver MRI PDFF and liver health. © RSNA, 2023 Supplemental material is available for this article.

This study evaluated the pharmacokinetics, exposure-response, and exposure-pharmacodynamics relationships of tremelimumab in patients with unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (uHCC). PATIENTS AND METHODS: A previous tremelimumab population pharmacokinetic model was validated using data from parts 2 and 3 of Study 22. Exposure-response analyses explored relationships of tremelimumab exposure with efficacy and safety. Pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics relationships were evaluated using linear and nonlinear regression models. RESULTS: The observed pharmacokinetics of tremelimumab in uHCC were consistent with predictions; no significant covariates were identified. Tremelimumab exposure was not significantly associated with adverse events, objective response rate, or progression-free survival. Overall survival (OS) was longer for patients with tremelimumab exposure, minimum serum drug concentration (Cmin1) ≥ median versus Cmin1 < median (18.99 months vs. 10.97 months), but this exposure-survival analysis might be confounded with baseline characteristics of albumin level and neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio, which had a significant impact on OS (P = 0.0004 and 0.0001, respectively). The predicted Cmin1 of tremelimumab in STRIDE regimen (12.9 μg/mL) was greater than the estimated concentration of tremelimumab eliciting half-maximal increases (EC50 = 5.24 μg/mL) in CD8+Ki67+ T-cell counts.

Median age was 66·0 years (IQR 57·0-72·0), 644 (81%) of 794 were male, 150 (19%) were female, 345 (43%) were Asian, 345 (43%) were White, 22 (3%) were multiple races, 21 (3%) were American Indian or Alaska Native, 21 (3%) were Native Hawaiian or other Pacific Islander, 13 (2%) were Black or African American, and 46 (6%) did not have available race data. Median follow up as of data cutoff for the final analysis (June 21, 2022) was 32·1 months (IQR 29·4-35·3). Median overall survival was 21·2 months (95% CI 19·0-23·6; 252 [64%] of 395 died) with lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab versus 19·0 months (17·2-21·7; 282 [71%] of 399 died) with lenvatinib plus placebo (hazard ratio [HR] 0·84; 95% CI 0·71-1·00; stratified log-rank p=0·023). As of data cutoff for the progression-free survival final analysis (April 5, 2021), median progression-free survival was 8·2 months (95% CI 6·4-8·4; 270 events occurred [42 deaths; 228 progressions]) with lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab versus 8·0 months (6·3-8·2; 301 events occurred [36 deaths; 265 progressions]) with lenvatinib plus placebo (HR 0·87; 95% CI 0·73-1·02; stratified log-rank p=0·047). The most common treatment-related grade 3-4 adverse events were hypertension (69 [17%] of 395 patients in the lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab group vs 68 [17%] of 395 patients) in the lenvatinib plus placebo group), increased aspartate aminotransferase (27 [7%] vs 17 [4%]), and diarrhoea (25 [6%] vs 15 [4%]). Treatment-related deaths occurred in four (1%) patients in the lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab group (due to gastrointestinal haemorrhage and hepatorenal syndrome [n=1 each] and hepatic encephalopathy [n=2]) and in three (1%) patients in the lenvatinib plus placebo group (due to gastrointestinal haemorrhage, hepatorenal syndrome, and cerebrovascular accident [n=1 each]). INTERPRETATION: In earlier studies, the addition of pembrolizumab to lenvatinib as first-line therapy for advanced hepatocellular carcinoma has shown promising clinical activity; however, lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab did not meet prespecified significance for improved overall survival and progression-free survival versus lenvatinib plus placebo.

9,Aspirin for Metabolic Dysfunction-Associated Steatotic Liver Disease Without Cirrhosis: A Randomized Clinical Trial.,Simon TG; Wilechansky RM; Stoyanova S; Grossman A; Dichtel LE; Lauer GM; Miller KK; Hoshida Y; Corey KE; Loomba R; Chung RT; Chan AT,"IMPORTANCE: Aspirin may reduce severity of metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD) and lower the incidence of end-stage liver disease and hepatocellular carcinoma, in patients with MASLD. However, the effect of aspirin on MASLD is unknown. OBJECTIVE: To test whether low-dose aspirin reduces liver fat content, compared with placebo, in adults with MASLD. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This 6-month, phase 2, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial was conducted at a single hospital in Boston, Massachusetts. Participants were aged 18 to 70 years with established MASLD without cirrhosis. Enrollment occurred between August 20, 2019, and July 19, 2022, with final follow-up on February 23, 2023. INTERVENTIONS: Participants were randomized (1:1) to receive either once-daily aspirin, 81 mg (n = 40) or identical placebo pills (n = 40) for 6 months. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary end point was mean absolute change in hepatic fat content, measured by proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) at 6-month follow-up. The 4 key secondary outcomes included mean percentage change in hepatic fat content by MRS, the proportion achieving at least 30% reduction in hepatic fat, and the mean absolute and relative reductions in hepatic fat content, measured by magnetic resonance imaging proton density fat fraction (MRI-PDFF). Analyses adjusted for the baseline value of the corresponding outcome. Minimal clinically important differences for study outcomes were not prespecified. RESULTS: Among 80 randomized participants (mean age, 48 years; 44 [55%] women; mean hepatic fat content, 35% [indicating moderate steatosis]), 71 (89%) completed 6-month follow-up. The mean absolute change in hepatic fat content by MRS was -6.6% with aspirin vs 3.6% with placebo (difference, -10.2% [95% CI, -27.7% to -2.6%]; P = .009). Compared with placebo, aspirin treatment significantly reduced relative hepatic fat content (-8.8 vs 30.0 percentage points; mean difference, -38.8 percentage points [95% CI, -66.7 to -10.8]; P = .007), increased the proportion of patients with 30% or greater relative reduction in hepatic fat (42.5% vs 12.5%; mean difference, 30.0% [95% CI, 11.6% to 48.4%]; P = .006), reduced absolute hepatic fat content by MRI-PDFF (-2.7% vs 0.9%; mean difference, -3.7% [95% CI, -6.1% to -1.2%]; P = .004]), and reduced relative hepatic fat content by MRI-PDFF (-11.7 vs 15.7 percentage points; mean difference, -27.3 percentage points [95% CI, -45.2 to -9.4]; P = .003). Thirteen participants (32.5%) in each group experienced an adverse event, most commonly upper respiratory tract infections (10.0% in each group) or arthralgias (5.0% for aspirin vs 7.5% for placebo). One participant randomized to aspirin (2.5%) experienced drug-related heartburn. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this preliminary randomized clinical trial of patients with MASLD, 6 months of daily low-dose aspirin significantly reduced hepatic fat quantity compared with placebo. Further study in a larger sample size is necessary to confirm these findings.

10,Laparoscopic liver resection versus radiofrequency ablation for small hepatocellular carcinoma: randomized clinical trial.,Song J; Cao L; Ma K; Li J; Wang X; Chen J; Zheng S,"BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to compare the efficacy of laparoscopic liver resection versus radiofrequency ablation for treatment of small hepatocellular carcinoma. METHODS: This single-centre RCT was conducted at a tertiary referral centre in China. Patients with small hepatocellular carcinoma who had a single nodule no larger than 5 cm, or up to three nodules of 3 cm or smaller, were eligible. Patients were assigned randomly in a 1 : 1 ratio to either laparoscopic liver resection or radiofrequency ablation. Blinding was not attempted. Sample size calculations led to 75 patients per group. The primary outcome was overall survival, and the secondary outcome was recurrence-free survival. RESULTS: Seventy-five patients were included in each group. Overall survival (HR 1.26, 95% c.i. 0.69 to 2.30; P = 0.451) and recurrence-free survival (HR 1.34, 0.86 to 2.08; P = 0.189) did not differ between the resection and ablation groups. The 1-, 3- and 5-year overall survival rates were 94.7, 80.0, and 74.7% respectively after laparoscopic liver resection versus 93.3, 78.7, and 67.9% after radiofrequency ablation. Corresponding recurrence-free survival rates were 78.7, 61.3, and 51.6%, and 69.3, 53.3, and 41.0%, respectively. CONCLUSION: For small hepatocellular carcinoma, percutaneous radiofrequency ablation provides therapeutic effects similar to those of laparoscopic liver resection.

11,"Lenvatinib Combined With Transarterial Chemoembolization as First-Line Treatment for Advanced Hepatocellular Carcinoma: A Phase III, Randomized Clinical Trial (LAUNCH).",Peng Z; Fan W; Zhu B; Wang G; Sun J; Xiao C; Huang F; Tang R; Cheng Y; Huang Z; Liang Y; Fan H; Qiao L; Li F; Zhuang W; Peng B; Wang J; Li J; Kuang M,"PURPOSE: Lenvatinib (LEN) is a first-line therapy for patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC); however, it has shown modest survival benefits. Therefore, we aimed to compare clinical outcomes of LEN combined with transarterial chemoembolization (LEN-TACE) versus LEN monotherapy in patients with advanced HCC. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This was a multicenter, randomized, open-label, parallel group, phase III trial. Patients with primary treatment-naive or initial recurrent advanced HCC after surgery were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive LEN plus on-demand TACE (LEN-TACE) or LEN monotherapy. LEN was initiated within 3 days after random assignment (initial dose: 12 mg once daily for patients ≥ 60 kg; 8 mg once daily for patients < 60 kg). TACE was initiated one day after LEN initiation. The primary end point was overall survival (OS). RESULTS: Between June 2019 and July 2021, a total of 338 patients underwent random assignment at 12 centers in China: 170 to LEN-TACE and 168 to LEN. At a prespecified event-driven interim analysis after a median follow-up of 17.0 months, the median OS was significantly longer in the LEN-TACE group (17.8 v 11.5 months; hazard ratio, 0.45; P < .001). The median progression-free survival was 10.6 months in the LEN-TACE group and 6.4 months in the LEN group (hazard ratio, 0.43; P < .001). Patients in the LEN-TACE group had a higher objective response rate according to the modified RECIST (54.1% v 25.0%, P < .001). Multivariable analysis revealed that portal vein tumor thrombus and treatment allocation were independent risk factors for OS.

We aimed to develop and validate two novel prediction models using multivariate longitudinal data, with or without cell-free DNA (cfDNA) signatures. METHODS: A total of 13,728 patients from two nationwide multicenter prospective observational cohorts, the majority of whom had chronic hepatitis B, were enrolled. aMAP score, as one of the most promising HCC prediction models, was evaluated for each patient. Low-pass whole-genome sequencing was used to derive multi-modal cfDNA fragmentomics features. A longitudinal discriminant analysis algorithm was used to model longitudinal profiles of patient biomarkers and estimate the risk of HCC development. RESULTS: We developed and externally validated two novel HCC prediction models with a greater accuracy, termed aMAP-2 and aMAP-2 Plus scores. The aMAP-2 score, calculated with longitudinal data on the aMAP score and alpha-fetoprotein values during an up to 8-year follow-up, performed superbly in the training and external validation cohorts (AUC 0.83-0.84). The aMAP-2 score showed further improvement and accurately divided aMAP-defined high-risk patients into two groups with 5-year cumulative HCC incidences of 23.4% and 4.1%, respectively (p = 0.0065). The aMAP-2 Plus score, which incorporates cfDNA signatures (nucleosome, fragment and motif scores), optimized the prediction of HCC development, especially for patients with cirrhosis (AUC 0.85-0.89). Importantly, the stepwise approach (aMAP -> aMAP-2 -> aMAP-2 Plus) stratified patients with cirrhosis into two groups, comprising 90% and 10% of the cohort, with an annual HCC incidence of 0.8% and 12.5%, respectively (p <0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: aMAP-2 and aMAP-2 Plus scores are highly accurate in predicting HCC. The stepwise application of aMAP scores provides an improved enrichment strategy, identifying patients at a high risk of HCC, which could effectively guide individualized HCC surveillance. IMPACT AND IMPLICATIONS: In this multicenter nationwide cohort study, we developed and externally validated two novel hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) risk prediction models (called aMAP-2 and aMAP-2 Plus scores), using longitudinal discriminant analysis algorithm and longitudinal data (i.e., aMAP and alpha-fetoprotein) with or without the addition of cell-free DNA signatures, based on 13,728 patients from 61 centers across mainland China. Our findings demonstrated that the performance of aMAP-2 and aMAP-2 Plus scores was markedly better than the original aMAP score, and any other existing HCC risk scores across all subsets, especially for patients with cirrhosis. More importantly, the stepwise application of aMAP scores (aMAP -> aMAP-2 -> aMAP-2 Plus) provides an improved enrichment strategy, identifying patients at high risk of HCC, which could effectively guide individualized HCC surveillance.",False,"Does not meet the target criteria for intervention, comparison, outcome, or study design.",patients at risk of hepatocellular carcinoma,not specified,not specified,prediction of HCC development,observational study,False,"Does not meet the target criteria for intervention, comparison, outcome, or study design",-,-,-,-,-,,No disagreement between Model A and B,False

We aimed to investigate the risk of HCC across a multicentre AIH cohort and to identify predictive factors. METHODS: We performed a retrospective, observational, multicentric study of patients included in the International Autoimmune Hepatitis Group Retrospective Registry. The assessed clinical outcomes were HCC development, liver transplantation, and death. Fine and Gray regression analysis stratified by centre was applied to determine the effects of individual covariates; the cumulative incidence of HCC was estimated using the competing risk method with death as a competing risk. RESULTS: A total of 1,428 patients diagnosed with AIH from 1980 to 2020 from 22 eligible centres across Europe and Canada were included, with a median follow-up of 11.1 years (interquartile range 5.2-15.9). Two hundred and ninety-three (20.5%) patients had cirrhosis at diagnosis. During follow-up, 24 patients developed HCC (1.7%), an incidence rate of 1.44 cases/1,000 patient-years; the cumulative incidence of HCC increased over time (0.6% at 5 years, 0.9% at 10 years, 2.7% at 20 years, and 6.6% at 30 years of follow-up). Patients who developed cirrhosis during follow-up had a significantly higher incidence of HCC. The cumulative incidence of HCC was 2.6%, 4.6%, 5.6% and 6.6% at 5, 10, 15, and 20 years after the development of cirrhosis, respectively. Obesity (hazard ratio [HR] 2.94, p = 0.04), cirrhosis (HR 3.17, p = 0.01), and AIH/PSC variant syndrome (HR 5.18, p = 0.007) at baseline were independent risk factors for HCC development. CONCLUSIONS: HCC incidence in AIH is low even after cirrhosis development and is associated with risk factors including obesity, cirrhosis, and AIH/PSC variant syndrome. IMPACT AND IMPLICATIONS: The risk of developing hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in individuals with autoimmune hepatitis (AIH) seems to be lower than for other aetiologies of chronic liver disease. Yet, solid data for this specific patient group remain elusive, given that most of the existing evidence comes from small, single-centre studies. In our study, we found that HCC incidence in patients with AIH is low even after the onset of cirrhosis. Additionally, factors such as advanced age, obesity, cirrhosis, alcohol consumption, and the presence of the AIH/PSC variant syndrome at the time of AIH diagnosis are linked to a higher risk of HCC. Based on these findings, there seems to be merit in adopting a specialized HCC monitoring programme for patients with AIH based on their individual risk factors. Elsevier B.V.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: In this randomized, open-label, multicenter trial, histologically confirmed HCC patients with MVI were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive adjuvant FOLFOX-HAIC (treatment group) or routine follow-up (control group). The primary end point was disease-free survival (DFS) by intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis while secondary end points were overall survival, recurrence rate, and safety. RESULTS: Between June 2016 and August 2021, a total of 315 patients (ITT population) at five centers were randomly assigned to the treatment group (n = 157) or the control group (n = 158). In the ITT population, the median DFS was 20.3 months (95% CI, 10.4 to 30.3) in the treatment group versus 10.0 months (95% CI, 6.8 to 13.2) in the control group (hazard ratio, 0.59; 95% CI, 0.43 to 0.81; P = .001).

We aimed to assess the safety and antitumour activity of cadonilimab monotherapy, a bispecific PD-1/CTLA-4 antibody, in patients with advanced solid tumours. METHODS: This multicentre, open-label, phase 1b/2 trial was conducted across 30 hospitals in China. Patients aged 18 years or older with histologically or cytologically confirmed, unresectable advanced solid tumours, unsuccessful completion of at least one previous systemic therapy, and an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0 or 1 were eligible for inclusion. Patients who had previously received anti-PD-1, anti-PD-L1, or anti-CTLA-4 treatment were not eligible for inclusion. In the dose escalation phase of phase 1b, patients received intravenous cadonilimab at 6 mg/kg and 10 mg/kg every 2 weeks. In the dose expansion phase of phase 1b, cadonilimab at 6 mg/kg and a fixed dose of 450 mg were given intravenously every 2 weeks. In phase 2, cadonilimab at 6 mg/kg was administered intravenously every 2 weeks in three cohorts: patients with cervical cancer, oesophageal squamous cell carcinoma, and hepatocellular carcinoma. The primary endpoints were the safety of cadonilimab in phase 1b and objective response rate in phase 2, based on the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST), version 1.1. The safety analysis was done in all patients who received at least one dose of cadonilimab. Antitumour activity was assessed in the full analysis set for the cervical cancer cohort, and in all patients with measurable disease at baseline and who received at least one dose of cadonilimab in the oesophageal squamous cell carcinoma and hepatocellular carcinoma cohorts. The study is registered on ClinicalTrial.gov, NCT03852251, and closed to new participants; follow-up has been completed. FINDINGS: Between Jan 18, 2019, and Jan 8, 2021, 240 patients (83 [43 male and 40 female] in phase 1b and 157 in phase 2) were enrolled. Phase 2 enrolled 111 female patients with cervical cancer, 22 patients with oesophageal squamous cell carcinoma (15 male and seven female), and 24 patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (17 male and seven female). During dose escalation, no dose-limiting toxicities occurred. Grade 3-4 treatment-related adverse events occurred in 67 (28%) of 240 patients; the most frequent grade 3 or worse treatment-related adverse events were anaemia (seven [3%]), increased lipase (four [2%]), decreased bodyweight (three [1%]), decreased appetite (four [2%]), decreased neutrophil count (three [1%]), and infusion-related reaction (two [1%]). 17 (7%) patients discontinued treatment due to treatment-related adverse events. 54 (23%) of 240 patients reported serious treatment-related adverse events, including five patients who died (one due to myocardial infarction; cause unknown for four). In phase 2, in the cervical cancer cohort, with a median follow-up of 14·6 months (IQR 13·1-17·5), the objective response rate was 32·3% (32 of 99; 95% CI 23·3-42·5). In the oesophageal squamous cell carcinoma cohort, with a median follow-up of 17·9 months (IQR 4·0-15·1), the objective response rate was 18·2% (four of 22; 95% CI 5·2-40·3). In the hepatocellular carcinoma cohort, with a median follow-up of 19·6 months (IQR 8·7-19·8), the objective response rate was 16·7% (four of 24; 95% CI 4·7-37·4).

Combination therapy of tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) and anti-programmed cell death protein-1 (PD-1) antibodies has achieved a high tumor response rate in both the first-line and second-line treatment of advanced HCC. However, few studies have prospectively evaluated whether TKIs plus anti-PD-1 antibodies could convert unresectable intermediate-advanced HCC into resectable disease. METHODS: This single-arm, phase II study enrolled systemic therapy-naïve adult patients with unresectable Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer stage B or C HCC. Patients received oral lenvatinib one time per day plus intravenous anti-PD-1 agents every 3 weeks (one cycle). Tumor response and resectability were evaluated before the fourth cycle, then every two cycles. The primary endpoint was conversion success rate by investigator assessment. Secondary endpoints included objective response rate (ORR) by independent imaging review (IIR) assessment per modified RECIST (mRECIST) and Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors, V.1.1 (RECIST 1.1), progression-free survival (PFS) and 12-month recurrence-free survival (RFS) rate by IIR per mRECIST, R0 resection rate, overall survival (OS), and safety. Biomarkers were assessed as exploratory objectives. RESULTS: Of the 56 eligible patients enrolled, 53 (94.6%) had macrovascular invasion, and 16 (28.6%) had extrahepatic metastasis. The median follow-up was 23.5 months. The primary endpoint showed a conversion success rate of 55.4% (31/56). ORR was 53.6% per mRECIST and 44.6% per RECIST 1.1. Median PFS was 8.9 months, and median OS was 23.9 months. Among the 31 successful conversion patients, 21 underwent surgery with an R0 resection rate of 85.7%, a pathological complete response rate of 38.1%, and a 12-month RFS rate of 47.6%. Grade ≥3 treatment-related adverse events were observed in 42.9% of patients. Tumor immune microenvironment analysis of pretreatment samples displayed significant enrichment of CD8(+) T cells (p=0.03) in responders versus non-responders. CONCLUSION: Lenvatinib plus anti-PD-1 antibodies demonstrate promising efficacy and tolerable safety as conversion therapy in unresectable HCC.

Eligible patients were those aged 18 years or older with an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status 0-1, Child-Pugh liver function score A5 to B7, tumour size of at least 5 cm, a maximum of three tumour lesions, and adequate hepatic, renal, and bone marrow function. Participants received TACE on day 1, followed by stereotactic body radiotherapy (27·5-40·0 Gy in five fractions) at day 28. Avelumab (10 mg/kg) was administered 14 days following stereotactic body radiotherapy and every 2 weeks thereafter. The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients deemed amenable to curative treatment, defined as those who had a sustained complete or partial treatment response for at least 2 months and if curative treatment could be performed (ie, resection, radiofrequency ablation, or transplantation), analysed by intention to treat. Safety was also analysed in the intention-to-treat population. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT03817736) and has been completed. FINDINGS: Between March 18, 2019, and Jan 27, 2021, 33 patients (32 [97%] men and one [3%] woman) were enrolled. The median sum of the largest diameters of lesions was 15·1 cm (IQR 8·3-14·9). 21 (64%) patients had macrovascular invasion (hepatic vein [n=13], branched portal vein [n=3], or both [n=5]). Median follow-up was 17·2 months (IQR 7·8-25·8). 18 (55%) patients were deemed amenable to curative treatment: four (12%) of 33 patients had curative treatment (resection [n=2] or radiofrequency ablation [n=2]), and 14 (42%) had a radiological complete response and opted for close surveillance. 11 (33%) of 33 patients had treatment-related adverse events that were grade 3 or worse. The most common treatment-related grade 3 or worse adverse event was transient increase in alanine aminotransferase or aspartate aminotransferase (five [15%]) after TACE. Five (15%) patients developed immune-related adverse events of grade 3 or worse (three had hepatitis, two had dermatitis). INTERPRETATION: To our knowledge, this is the first prospective trial using the combination of immunotherapy and locoregional treatment as conversion therapy for locally advanced unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma, with promising results. Future randomised trials with larger cohorts of patients are warranted.

SAFFRON-104 (NCT03941873) was a multicohort phase Ib/II study investigating sitravatinib with/without tislelizumab, an anti-programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) antibody, in patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) or gastric cancer/gastroesophageal junction cancer (GC/GEJC). METHODS: Eligible patients had histologically/cytologically confirmed advanced HCC or GC/GEJC. Phase I determined the recommended phase II dose (RP2D) of sitravatinib with/without tislelizumab. Phase II evaluated sitravatinib monotherapy in patients with pretreated HCC, and sitravatinib plus tislelizumab in anti-PD-(L)1-naïve or -treated HCC and anti-PD-(L)1-naïve GC/GEJC. Primary endpoints were safety/tolerability (phase I) and objective response rate (ORR) (phase II). RESULTS: At data cutoff (March 31, 2023), 111 patients were enrolled; 102 were efficacy-evaluable (median study follow-up 9.1 months [range: 0.7-36.9]). The RP2D of sitravatinib was determined as 120 mg orally once daily. In patients receiving sitravatinib monotherapy and sitravatinib in combination with tislelizumab, grade ≥ 3 treatment-related adverse events occurred in 14 (51.9%) and 42 (50.0%) patients, respectively. The ORR was 25% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 8.7-49.1) in patients with pretreated HCC receiving sitravatinib monotherapy.

A personalized therapeutic cancer vaccine (PTCV) may enhance responses to PD-1 inhibitors through the induction of tumor-specific immunity. We present results from a single-arm, open-label, phase 1/2 study of a DNA plasmid PTCV (GNOS-PV02) encoding up to 40 neoantigens coadministered with plasmid-encoded interleukin-12 plus pembrolizumab in patients with advanced HCC previously treated with a multityrosine kinase inhibitor. Safety and immunogenicity were assessed as primary endpoints, and treatment efficacy and feasibility were evaluated as secondary endpoints. The most common treatment-related adverse events were injection-site reactions, observed in 15 of 36 (41.6%) patients. No dose-limiting toxicities or treatment-related grade ≥3 events were observed. The objective response rate (modified intention-to-treat) per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors 1.1 was 30.6% (11 of 36 patients), with 8.3% (3 of 36) of patients achieving a complete response. Clinical responses were associated with the number of neoantigens encoded in the vaccine. Neoantigen-specific T cell responses were confirmed in 19 of 22 (86.4%) evaluable patients by enzyme-linked immunosorbent spot assays. Multiparametric cellular profiling revealed active, proliferative and cytolytic vaccine-specific CD4(+) and CD8(+) effector T cells. T cell receptor β-chain (TCRβ) bulk sequencing results demonstrated vaccination-enriched T cell clone expansion and tumor infiltration. Single-cell analysis revealed posttreatment T cell clonal expansion of cytotoxic T cell phenotypes. TCR complementarity-determining region cloning of expanded T cell clones in the tumors following vaccination confirmed reactivity against vaccine-encoded neoantigens.

Our study aimed to estimate the global burden and trends of liver cancer attributable to comorbid T2DM among people living with HBV from 1990 to 2019. METHODS: We calculated the population attributable fractions (PAFs) of liver cancer attributable to comorbid T2DM among the burden of HBV-related liver cancer. We applied the PAFs to the burden of HBV-related liver cancer derived from the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) 2019 database to obtain the burden of liver cancer attributable to HBV-T2DM comorbidity. The prevalence, disability-adjusted life year (DALY), and deaths of liver cancer attributable to the comorbidity were assessed at the global, regional, and country levels and then stratified by the sociodemographic index (SDI), sex, and age group. Estimated annual percentage changes (EAPCs) were calculated to quantify the temporal trends. RESULTS: In 2019, the global age-standardized prevalence and DALY rates of liver cancer attributable to HBV-T2DM comorbidity were 9.9 (8.4-11.5) and 182.4 (154.9-212.7) per 10,000,000 individuals, respectively. High-income Asia Pacific and East Asia had the highest age-standardized prevalence and DALY rates of liver cancer attributable to HBV-T2DM comorbidity, respectively. From 1990 to 2019, age-standardized prevalence and DALY rates increased in 16 out of 21 GBD regions. High-income North America had the largest annual increases in both age-standardized prevalence rates (EAPC = 6.07; 95% UI, 5.59 to 6.56) and DALY rates (EAPC = 4.77; 95% UI, 4.35 to 5.20), followed by Australasia and Central Asia. Across all SDI regions, the high SDI region exhibited the most rapid increase in age-standardized prevalence and DALY rates from 1990 to 2019. Additionally, men had consistently higher disease burdens than women across all age groups. The patterns of mortality burden and trends are similar to those of DALYs.

Adjuvant immunotherapy is considered a promising avenue. This multicenter, open-label, randomized, controlled, phase 2 trial was conducted at six hospitals in China to assess the efficacy and safety of adjuvant sintilimab, a programmed cell death protein 1 inhibitor, in these patients. Eligible patients with HCC with MVI were randomized (1:1) into the sintilimab or active surveillance group. The sintilimab group received intravenous injections every 3 weeks for a total of eight cycles. The primary endpoint was recurrence-free survival (RFS) in the intention-to-treat population. Key secondary endpoints included overall survival (OS) and safety. From September 1, 2020, to April 23, 2022, a total of 198 eligible patients were randomly allocated to receive adjuvant sintilimab (n = 99) or undergo active surveillance (n = 99). After a median follow-up of 23.3 months, the trial met the prespecified endpoints. Sintilimab significantly prolonged RFS compared to active surveillance (median RFS, 27.7 versus 15.5 months; hazard ratio 0.534, 95% confidence interval 0.360-0.792; P = 0.002). Further follow-up is needed to confirm the difference in OS. In the sintilimab group, 12.4% of patients experienced grade 3 or 4 treatment-related adverse events, the most common of which were elevated alanine aminotransferase levels (5.2%) and anemia (4.1%).

To overcome diagnostic and therapeutic challenges, a better mechanistic understanding of irAE-n is paramount. METHODS: In this observational cohort study, we collected serum and peripheral blood samples from 34 consecutive cancer patients with irAE-n (during acute illness) and 49 cancer control patients without irAE-n (pre- and on-ICI treatment, n = 44 without high-grade irAEs, n = 5 with high-grade nonneurologic irAEs). Patients received either anti-programmed cell death protein (PD)-1 or anti-PD ligand-1 monotherapy or anti-PD-1/anti-cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated protein-4 combination therapy. Most common cancers were melanoma, lung cancer, and hepatocellular carcinoma. Peripheral blood immune profiling was performed using 48-marker single-cell mass cytometry and a multiplex cytokine assay. RESULTS: During acute illness, patients with irAE-n presented higher frequencies of cluster of differentiation (CD)8+ effector memory type (EM-)1 and central memory (CM) T cells compared to controls without irAEs. Multiorgan immunotoxicities (neurologic + nonneurologic) were associated with higher CD8+ EM1 T cell counts. While there were no B cell changes in the overall cohort, we detected a marked decrease of IgD- CD11c+ CD21low and IgD- CD24+ CD21high B cells in a subgroup of patients with autoantibody-positive irAE-n. We further identified signatures indicative of enhanced chemotaxis and inflammation in irAE-n patients and discovered C-X-C motif chemokine ligand (CXCL)10 as a promising marker to diagnose high-grade immunotoxicities such as irAE-n. CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrate profound and partly subgroup-specific immune cell dysregulation in irAE-n patients, which may guide future biomarker development and targeted treatment approaches.

25,Treatment of localized hepatocellular carcinoma: resection vs. ablation vs. radiation.,Anderson C; Chin HM; Hoverson J; Court C; Wagner T; Newman NB,"Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a common malignancy with many patients presenting with local disease. As of date, the use of radiation is not included in the commonly utilized Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC) classification but is in the National Comprehensive Cancer Network guidelines. Radiation can volumetrically cover the entire tumor and with novel technologic advances can be administered non-invasively with excellent clinical outcomes with few adverse events. The gold standard for localized early HCC (such as BCLC-A) is resection or transplantation. In patients who are not candidates for surgical treatment, locoregional therapy should be considered as an optimal therapy for these patients. Tumor ablation techniques such as microwave ablation (MWA) and radiofrequency ablation (RFA) are excellent tools to control local disease or bridge to transplantation. Should these not be possible though then ablation with external beam radiation is also capable of yielding comparable local control and serve as a bridge to transplant without worse rates of adverse events. For tumors that meet Milan criteria for transplantation, in comparison to transarterial chemoembolization (TACE), there is considerable randomized evidence demonstrating better local control, less adverse events, better progression-free survival (PFS), and less costly. It can be utilized as a bridge in Barcelona liver class B. For larger localized tumors though (extrahepatic disease or vascular invasion like BCLC-C), stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) is shown via a randomized clinical trial to have a survival benefit, local control benefit, and no worse adverse events compared to systemic therapy. In this setting, it should be considered the local consolidation standard of care.",False,No comparison to standard therapy or placebo specified; study design not specified,patients with localized early HCC,radiation therapy,not specified,local control and adverse events,not specified,False,No comparison to standard therapy or placebo specified; study design not specified,-,-,-,-,-,,No disagreement between Model A and B,False

Forty-two patients received nivolumab 480 mg every 4 weeks and regorafenib 80 mg daily (3-weeks-on/1-week-off schedule). The primary endpoint was the investigator-assessed objective response rate (ORR) per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) version 1.1.

The aim of this study was to determine whether radiotherapy improves hepatic pain from cancer. METHODS: In this open-label, randomised, controlled, phase 3 trial (CCTG HE1) done in nine cancer centres across Canada, we included patients aged 18 years or older with hepatocellular carcinoma or liver metastases, who were refractory to standard treatment, with an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0-3, with life expectancy of more than 3 months, and pain or discomfort at its worst in the past 24 hours on the Brief Pain Inventory (BPI) of at least 4 out of 10, which was stable for up to 7 days before randomisation. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1), via a minimisation method after stratification by centre and type of cancer (hepatocellular carcinoma vs liver metastases), to single-fraction radiotherapy (8 Gy) to the liver with 8 mg ondansetron (or equivalent) orally and 4 mg dexamethasone orally given 1-2 h before radiotherapy plus best supportive care (including non-opioid or opioid analgesia, or dexamethasone, or a combination of these) or best supportive care alone. The primary endpoint was improvement in patient-reported liver cancer pain or discomfort of at least 2 points on worst pain intensity on the BPI at 1 month after randomisation. All patients with both baseline and 1-month assessments were included in the primary endpoint analysis. Safety was assessed in all patients randomly assigned to treatment. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT02511522, and is complete. FINDINGS: Between July 25, 2015, and June 2, 2022, 66 patients were screened and randomly assigned to radiotherapy plus best supportive care (n=33) or best supportive care (n=33). Median age was 65 years (IQR 57-72), 37 (56%) of 66 patients were male, 29 (44%) were female, 43 (65%) had liver metastases, and 23 (35%) had hepatocellular carcinoma (data on race and ethnicity were not collected). As of data cutoff (Sept 8, 2022), median follow-up was 3·2 months (95% CI 3·0-3·4). 24 (73%) of 33 in the radiotherapy plus best supportive care group and 18 (55%) of 33 in the best supportive care only group completed baseline and 1-month assessments. An improvement in hepatic pain of at least 2 points in worst pain intensity on the BPI at 1 month was seen in 16 (67%) of 24 patients in the radiotherapy plus best supportive care group versus four (22%) of 18 patients in the best supportive care group (p=0·0042).

OBJECTIVE: To investigate which OAD is associated with the best patient outcomes in NAFLD and type 2 diabetes (T2D). DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This retrospective nonrandomized interventional cohort study used the National Health Information Database, which provided population-level data for Korea. This study involved patients with T2D and concomitant NAFLD. EXPOSURES: Receiving either sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors, thiazolidinediones, dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitors, or sulfonylureas, each combined with metformin for 80% or more of 90 consecutive days. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The main outcomes were NAFLD regression assessed by the fatty liver index and composite liver-related outcome (defined as liver-related hospitalization, liver-related mortality, liver transplant, and hepatocellular carcinoma) using the Fine-Gray model regarding competing risks. RESULTS: In total, 80 178 patients (mean [SD] age, 58.5 [11.9] years; 43 007 [53.6%] male) were followed up for 219 941 person-years, with 4102 patients experiencing NAFLD regression. When compared with sulfonylureas, SGLT2 inhibitors (adjusted subdistribution hazard ratio [ASHR], 1.99 [95% CI, 1.75-2.27]), thiazolidinediones (ASHR, 1.70 [95% CI, 1.41-2.05]), and DPP-4 inhibitors (ASHR, 1.45 [95% CI, 1.31-1.59]) were associated with NAFLD regression. SGLT2 inhibitors were associated with a higher likelihood of NAFLD regression when compared with thiazolidinediones (ASHR, 1.40 [95% CI, 1.12-1.75]) and DPP-4 inhibitors (ASHR, 1.45 [95% CI, 1.30-1.62]). Only SGLT2 inhibitors (ASHR, 0.37 [95% CI, 0.17-0.82]), not thiazolidinediones or DPP-4 inhibitors, were significantly associated with lower incidence rates of adverse liver-related outcomes when compared with sulfonylureas. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: The results of this cohort study suggest that physicians may lean towards prescribing SGLT2 inhibitors as the preferred OAD for individuals with NAFLD and T2D, considering their potential benefits in NAFLD regression and lower incidences of adverse liver-related outcomes. This observational study should prompt future research to determine whether prescribing practices might merit reexamination.",False,Population does not match; no comparison to standard therapy or placebo specified; study design is not randomized controlled trial,patients with T2D and concomitant NAFLD,"SGLT2 inhibitors, thiazolidinediones, DPP-4 inhibitors, or sulfonylureas",not specified,NAFLD regression and liver-related outcomes,retrospective nonrandomized interventional cohort study,False,Population does not match; no comparison to standard therapy or placebo specified; study design is not randomized controlled trial,-,-,-,-,-,,No disagreement between Model A and B,False

Morbidity and mortality in cirrhosis patients are linked to portal hypertension, sarcopenia, and hepatocellular carcinoma. Although conventional cirrhosis management centered on treating complications, contemporary approaches prioritize preemptive measures. This study aims to formulate novel blood- and imaging-centric methodologies for monitoring liver cirrhosis patients. METHODS: In this prospective study, 150 liver cirrhosis patients will be enrolled from three Swedish liver clinics. Their conditions will be assessed through extensive blood-based markers and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The MRI protocol encompasses body composition profile with Muscle Assement Score, portal flow assessment, magnet resonance elastography, and a abbreviated MRI for HCC screening. Evaluation of lifestyle, muscular strength, physical performance, body composition, and quality of life will be conducted. Additionally, DNA, serum, and plasma biobanking will facilitate future investigations. DISCUSSION: The anticipated outcomes involve the identification and validation of non-invasive blood- and imaging-oriented biomarkers, enhancing the care paradigm for liver cirrhosis patients. Notably, the temporal evolution of these biomarkers will be crucial for understanding dynamic changes. TRIAL REGISTRATION: Clinicaltrials.gov, registration identifier NCT05502198.

30,"Endoscopic variceal ligation versus propranolol for the primary prevention of oesophageal variceal bleeding in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma: an open-label, two-centre, randomised controlled trial.",Yang TC; Chen WC; Hou MC; Chen PH; Lee PC; Chang CY; Lu HS; Chen YJ; Hsu SJ; Huang HC; Luo JC; Huang YH; Lee FY,"OBJECTIVE: This randomised trial aimed to address whether endoscopic variceal ligation (EVL) or propranolol (PPL) is more effective at preventing initial oesophageal variceal bleeding (EVB) in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). DESIGN: Patients with HCC and medium-to-large oesophageal varices (EVs) but without previous EVB were randomised to receive EVL (every 3-4 weeks until variceal eradication) or PPL (up to 320 mg daily) at a 1:1 ratio. Long-term follow-up data on EVB, other upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB), non-bleeding liver decompensation, overall survival (OS) and adverse events (AEs) were analysed using competing risk regression. RESULTS: Between June 2011 and April 2021, 144 patients were randomised to receive EVL (n=72) or PPL (n=72). In the EVL group, 7 patients experienced EVB, and 30 died; in the PPL group, 19 patients had EVB, and 40 died. The EVL group had a lower cumulative incidence of EVB (Gray's test, p=0.009) than its counterpart, with no mortality difference (Gray's test, p=0.085). For patients with Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC) stage A/B, EVL was better than PPL in reducing EVB (p<0.001) and mortality (p=0.003). For patients beyond BCLC stage B, between-group outcomes were similar. Other UGIB, non-bleeding liver decompensation and AEs did not differ between groups. A competing risk regression model confirmed the prognostic value of EVL. CONCLUSION: EVL is superior to PPL in preventing initial EVB in patients with HCC. The benefits of EVL on EVB and OS may be limited to patients with BCLC stage A/B and not to those with BCLC stage C/D. TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: NCT01970748. permissions.

METHODS: In this phase 2-3, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial, we assigned patients who had mild-to-moderate coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) and onset of symptoms within the past 3 days in a 1:1 ratio to receive 750 mg of simnotrelvir plus 100 mg of ritonavir or placebo twice daily for 5 days. The primary efficacy end point was the time to sustained resolution of symptoms, defined as the absence of 11 Covid-19-related symptoms for 2 consecutive days. Safety and changes in viral load were also assessed. RESULTS: A total of 1208 patients were enrolled at 35 sites in China; 603 were assigned to receive simnotrelvir and 605 to receive placebo. Among patients in the modified intention-to-treat population who received the first dose of trial drug or placebo within 72 hours after symptom onset, the time to sustained resolution of Covid-19 symptoms was significantly shorter in the simnotrelvir group than in the placebo group (180.1 hours [95% confidence interval {CI}, 162.1 to 201.6] vs. 216.0 hours [95% CI, 203.4 to 228.1]; median difference, -35.8 hours [95% CI, -60.1 to -12.4]; P = 0.006 by Peto-Prentice test). On day 5, the decrease in viral load from baseline was greater in the simnotrelvir group than in the placebo group (mean difference [±SE], -1.51±0.14 log(10) copies per milliliter; 95% CI, -1.79 to -1.24). The incidence of adverse events during treatment was higher in the simnotrelvir group than in the placebo group (29.0% vs. 21.6%). Most adverse events were mild or moderate.

This phase I/IIa pilot trial evaluated preliminary efficacy and safety of combination of radioembolization with yttrium-90 microspheres (Y90-radioembolization) and durvalumab in patients with locally advanced unresectable HCC. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients with Child-Pugh score ≤ 7 and locally advanced HCC, defined as Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC) stage B HCC or BCLC-C disease without extrahepatic metastases, received Y90-radioembolization followed by intravenous durvalumab 1,500 mg 7 to 14 days after Y90-radioembolization and every 4 weeks thereafter. Primary endpoint was time to progression (TTP) assessed by modified RECIST (mRECIST). Secondary endpoints included overall survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS), objective response rate (ORR) determined by mRECIST, and safety. RESULTS: All 24 patients enrolled received Y90-radioembolization and 23 received at least one dose of durvalumab. Median follow-up duration was 19.0 months (range, 2.2-24.2). Median TTP was 15.2 months [95% confidence interval (CI), 6.1-not estimated]. Median OS was not reached and 18-month OS rate was 58.3% (95% CI, 36.4-75.0). Median PFS was 6.9 months (95% CI, 5.4-15.2). Seven (29.2%) patients had a complete response and 13 (54.2%) had a partial response; ORR was 83.3% (95% CI, 62.6-95.3). Eleven (47.8%) patients experienced any-grade treatment-related adverse events. Two (8.7%) patients had grade 3 treatment-related adverse events (neutropenia and fever).

We conducted a retrospective multi-centre study to compare the clinical efficacy and safety of lenvatinib and atezolizumab with bevacizumab as a first-line treatment for patients with unresectable HCC in the real-world scenario. METHODS: Clinical features of lenvatinib and atezolizumab plus bevacizumab patients were balanced through inverse probability of treatment weighting (IPTW) methodology, which weights patients' characteristics and measured outcomes of each patient in both treatment arms. Overall survival (OS) was the primary end-point. RESULTS: The analysis included 1341 patients who received lenvatinib, and 864 patients who received atezolizumab plus bevacizumab. After IPTW adjustment, atezolizumab plus bevacizumab did not show a survival advantage over lenvatinib HR 0.97 (p = 0.739). OS was prolonged by atezolizumab plus bevacizumab over lenvatinib in viral patients (HR: 0.76; p = 0.024).

METHODS: In cohort 6 of the multicohort, open-label, phase I/II CheckMate 040 study, patients who were treatment-naive, sorafenib-intolerant, or had progressed on sorafenib were randomly assigned 1:1 to nivolumab 240 mg once every 2 weeks plus cabozantinib 40 mg once daily (doublet arm); or nivolumab 3 mg/kg every 2 weeks plus cabozantinib 40 mg once daily with ipilimumab 1 mg/kg once every 6 weeks (triplet arm). Primary objectives were safety and tolerability, objective response rate, and duration of response by investigator assessment per RECIST v1.1. Secondary objectives included progression-free survival (by blinded independent central review) and overall survival. RESULTS: Seventy-one patients were randomly assigned: 36 to the doublet arm and 35 to the triplet arm. After 32.0-month median follow-up, objective response rate (95% CI) was 17% (6 to 33) and 29% (15 to 46) in the doublet and triplet arms, respectively. Median (95% CI) duration of response was 8.3 (6.9 to not estimable) months in the doublet arm and not reached (0.0 to not estimable) in the triplet arm. Median progression-free survival was 5.1 and 4.3 months, and median overall survival was 20.2 and 22.1 months for the doublet and triplet arms, respectively. Grade 3-4 treatment-related adverse events occurred in 50% and 74% of patients and treatment-related adverse events leading to discontinuation were reported for 11% and 23% in the doublet and triplet arms, respectively.

35,Evaluation of the interest to combine a CD4 Th1-inducer cancer vaccine derived from telomerase and atezolizumab plus bevacizumab in unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma: a randomized non-comparative phase II study (TERTIO - PRODIGE 82).,Vienot A; Jacquin M; Rebucci-Peixoto M; Pureur D; Ghiringhelli F; Assenat E; Hammel P; Rosmorduc O; Stouvenot M; Allaire M; Bouattour M; Regnault H; Fratte S; Raymond E; Soularue E; Husson-Wetzel S; Di Martino V; Muller A; Clairet AL; Fagnoni-Legat C; Adotevi O; Meurisse A; Vernerey D; Borg C,"BACKGROUND: Several cancer immunotherapies that target the PD-L1/PD-1 pathway show promising clinical activity in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). However, the standard of care in first-line treatment with atezolizumab (anti-PD-L1 therapy) in combination with bevacizumab is associated with a limited objective response rate. Telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT) activation meets the criteria of oncogenic addiction in HCC and could be actionable therapeutic target and a relevant tumor antigen. Therefore we hypothesized that combining anti-PD-1/PD-L1 therapy with an anti-telomerase vaccine might be an attractive therapy in HCC. UCPVax is a therapeutic cancer vaccine composed of two separate peptides derived from telomerase (human TERT). UCPVax has been evaluated in a multicenter phase I/II study in non-small cell lung cancers and has demonstrated to be safe and immunogenic, and is under evaluation in combination with atezolizumab in a phase II clinical trial in tumors where telomerase reactivation contributes to an oncogene addiction (HPV(+) cancers). The aim of the TERTIO study is to determine the clinical interest and immunological efficacy of a treatment combining the CD4 helper T-inducer cancer anti-telomerase vaccine (UCPVax) with atezolizumab and bevacizumab in unresectable HCC in a multicenter randomized phase II study. METHODS: Patients with locally advanced, metastatic or unresectable HCC who have not previously received systemic anti-cancer treatment are eligible. The primary end point is the objective response rate at 6 months. Patients will be allocated to a treatment arm with a randomization 2:1. In both arms, patients will receive atezolizumab at fixed dose of 1200 mg IV infusion and bevacizumab at fixed dose of 15 mg/kg IV infusion, every 3 weeks, according to the standard of care. In the experimental arm, these treatments will be combined with the UCPVax vaccine at 0.5 mg subcutaneously. DISCUSSION: Combining anti-PD-1/PD-L1 therapy with an anti-telomerase vaccine gains serious consideration in HCC, in order to extend the clinical efficacy of anti-PD-1/PD-L1. Indeed, anti-cancer vaccines can induce tumor-specific T cell expansion and activation and therefore restore the cancer-immunity cycle in patients lacking pre-existing anti-tumor responses. Thus, there is a strong rational to combine immune checkpoint blockade therapy and anticancer vaccine (UCPVax) in order to activate antitumor T cell immunity and bypass the immunosuppression in the tumor microenvironment in HCC. This pivotal proof of concept study will evaluate the efficacy and safety of the combination of a CD4 Th1-inducer cancer vaccine derived from telomerase (UCPVax) and atezolizumab plus bevacizumab in unresectable HCC, as well as confirming their synergic mechanism, and settling the basis for a new combination for future clinical trials.

Nivolumab monotherapy demonstrated clinical benefit with an acceptable safety profile in patients with aHCC in the CheckMate 040 study. Five-year follow-up of the sorafenib-naive and sorafenib-experienced groups of CheckMate 040 is presented here. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients received nivolumab monotherapy at dose levels of 0.1-10.0 mg/kg (dose-escalation phase) or 3 mg/kg (dose-expansion phase) every 2 weeks until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Primary endpoints were safety and tolerability (dose escalation), and objective response rate (ORR) by blinded independent central review (BICR) and by investigator as per RECIST version 1.1 (dose expansion). RESULTS: Eighty sorafenib-naive and 154 sorafenib-experienced patients were treated. Minimum follow-up in both groups was 60 months. ORR as per BICR was 20% [95% confidence interval (CI) 12% to 30%] and 14% (95% CI 9% to 21%) in the sorafenib-naive and sorafenib-experienced groups, respectively. Responses occurred regardless of HCC etiology or baseline tumor cell programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression levels. Median overall survival (OS) was 26.6 months (95% CI 16.6-30.6 months) and 15.1 months (95% CI 13.0-18.2 months) in sorafenib-naive and sorafenib-experienced patients, respectively. The 3-year OS rates were 28% in the sorafenib-naive and 20% in the sorafenib-experienced groups; 5-year OS rates were 14% and 12%, respectively. No new safety signals were identified; grade 3/4 treatment-related adverse events were observed in 33% and 21% of patients in the sorafenib-naive and sorafenib-experienced groups, respectively. Biomarker analyses showed that baseline PD-L1 expression ≥1% was associated with higher ORR and longer OS compared with PD-L1 <1%. In the sorafenib-naive group, patients with OS ≥3 years exhibited higher baseline CD8 T-cell density compared with those with OS <1 year.

We conducted a phase II multicentre study on cabozantinib after ICI treatment in HCC. METHODS: This is an investigator-initiated, single-arm, clinical trial involving academic centres in Hong Kong and Korea. Key eligibility criteria included diagnosis of HCC, refractoriness to prior ICI-based treatment, and Child-Pugh A liver function. A maximum of two prior lines of therapy were allowed. All patients were commenced on cabozantinib at 60 mg/day. The primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS). RESULTS: Forty-seven patients were recruited from Oct 2020 to May 2022; 27 and 20 patients had received one and two prior therapies, respectively. Median follow-up was 11.2 months. The median PFS was 4.1 months (95% CI 3.3-5.3). The median overall survival (OS) was 9.9 months (95% CI 7.3-14.4), and the 1-year OS rate was 45.3%. Partial response and stable disease occurred in 3 (6.4%) and 36 (76.6%) patients, respectively. When used as a second-line treatment (n = 27), cabozantinib was associated with a median PFS and OS of 4.3 (95% CI 3.3-6.7) and 14.3 (95% CI 8.9-NR) months, respectively. The corresponding median PFS and OS were 4.3 (95% CI 3.3-11.0) and 14.3 (95% CI 9.0-NR) months, respectively, for those receiving ICI-based regimens with proven benefits (n = 17). The most common grade 3-4 treatment-related adverse event was thrombocytopenia (6.4%). The median dose of cabozantinib was 40 mg/day. The number of prior therapies was an independent prognosticator (one vs. two; hazard ratio = 0.37; p = 0.03). CONCLUSIONS: Cabozantinib demonstrated efficacy in patients who had received prior ICI regimens; survival data for second-line cabozantinib following first-line ICI regimens provide a reference for future clinical trial design. The number of prior lines of treatment may be considered a stratification factor in randomised studies. IMPACT AND IMPLICATIONS: Prospective data on systemic treatment following prior immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) therapy for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) are lacking. This phase II clinical trial provides efficacy and safety data on cabozantinib in patients who had received prior ICI-based treatment. Exploratory analyses showed that the performance of cabozantinib differed significantly when used as a second- or third-line treatment. The above data could be used as a reference for clinical practice and the design of future clinical trials on subsequent treatment lines following ICIs. GOV IDENTIFIER: NCT04588051. Elsevier B.V.

39,Hepatocellular Carcinoma in Ceará: Epidemiology and Treatment in a Reference Liver Transplant Center in Northeast Brazil.,Costa PEG; Garcia JHP; Coelho GR; Barros MAP; Hyppolito EB; Pereira KB; Rocha TDDS; Costa GCG,"Hepatocellular carcinoma remains a significant worldwide malignancy and an important cause of cancer-related death. The incidence is increasing globally. In Latin America, there is no consistent data on the epidemiology of hepatocellular carcinoma. However, Brazil is considered a country with an intermediate incidence of this liver neoplasm. In the state of Ceará, situated in the northeast region of Brazil, there are no consistent clinical and epidemiologic data on the actual incidence and the treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma. The purpose of this article is to describe epidemiologic characteristics and treatment forms of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma who were treated in a Liver Transplant Center. A retrospective observational study was conducted using the database from the register of 299 patients with hepatocellular carcinoma between June 2004 and February 2022. Only patients born in Ceará were included. Therefore, most patients were eligible, based on the Milan Criteria, to undergo liver transplantation with a Model End Stage Liver Disease score of 12.48 ± 4.66 points, and the waiting list time was approximately 7 months with 8.7% hepatocellular carcinoma recurrence after liver transplant. A total of 38.5 % of cases were outside the Milan criteria at the time of cancer diagnosis, and transarterial chemoembolization was the main treatment choice. In conclusion, the diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma in Ceará mainly occurs in male patients with hepatitis C or alcoholism, with a mean age of 61.55 years and a previous diagnosis of liver disease. Liver transplantation was the best curative therapeutic form in patients with cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma in Ceará, where a significant number of patients were diagnosed with intermediate and advanced-stage hepatocellular carcinoma, so public health policies are important for the screening and monitoring of liver disease.",False,study design does not match randomized controlled trial,"patients with hepatocellular carcinoma in Ceará, Brazil","liver transplantation, transarterial chemoembolization",not specified,"hepatocellular carcinoma recurrence, treatment outcomes",retrospective observational study,False,Study design is retrospective and not a randomized controlled trial,-,-,-,-,-,,No disagreement between Model A and B,False

We aim to characterize the clinical aspects of alcoholic liver disease-related HCC by a retrospective observational study that included all consequent patients diagnosed with MRI or histologically verified HCC in participating centers from 2010 to 2016. A total of 429 patients were included in the analysis, of which 412 patients (96%) had cirrhosis at the time of diagnosis. The most common etiologies were alcoholic liver disease (ALD) (48.3%), chronic hepatitis C (14.9%), NAFLD (12.6%), and chronic hepatitis B (10%). Patients with ALD-related HCC were more commonly males, more commonly had cirrhosis that was in more advanced stages, and had poorer performance status. Despite these results, no differences were observed in the overall (median 8.1 vs. 8.5 months) and progression-free survival (median 4.9 vs. 5.7 months). ALD-HCC patients within BCLC stage 0-A less frequently received potentially curative treatment as compared to the control HCC patients (62.2% vs. 87.5%, p = 0.017); and in patients with ALD-HCC liver function (MELD score) seemed to have a stronger influence on the prognosis compared to the control group HCC. Systemic inflammatory indexes were strongly associated with survival in the whole cohort. In conclusion, alcoholic liver disease is the most common cause of hepatocellular carcinoma in Slovakia, accounting for almost 50% of cases; and patients with ALD-related HCC more commonly had cirrhosis that was in more advanced stages and had poorer performance status, although no difference in survival between ALD-related and other etiology-related HCC was observed.",False,Intervention and comparison not specified; study design does not match,patients with hepatocellular carcinoma,not specified,not specified,overall and progression-free survival,retrospective observational study,False,Intervention and comparison not specified.

41,Patient-Reported Outcomes From the Phase III HIMALAYA Study of Tremelimumab Plus Durvalumab in Unresectable Hepatocellular Carcinoma.,Sangro B; Galle PR; Kelley RK; Charoentum C; De Toni EN; Ostapenko Y; Heo J; Cheng AL; Wilson Woods A; Gupta C; Abraham J; McCoy CL; Patel N; Negro A; Vogel A; Abou-Alfa GK,"PURPOSE: In the phase III HIMALAYA study (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT03298451) in unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (uHCC), the Single Tremelimumab Regular Interval Durvalumab (STRIDE) regimen significantly improved overall survival versus sorafenib, and durvalumab monotherapy was noninferior to sorafenib. Patient-reported outcomes (PROs), a secondary outcome from HIMALAYA, are reported here. METHODS: Participants were randomly assigned to receive STRIDE, durvalumab, or sorafenib. PROs were assessed (preplanned secondary outcome) using the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer 30-item Quality of Life Questionnaire and the 18-item HCC module. Time to deterioration (TTD), change from baseline and improvement rate in global health status/quality of life (GHS/QoL), functioning, and disease-related symptoms were analyzed. RESULTS: In total, 1,171 participants were randomly assigned to STRIDE (n = 393), durvalumab (n = 389), or sorafenib (n = 389) and were evaluable for PRO assessments. Across treatment arms, compliance rates for PROs were >77% at baseline and >70% overall. Baseline scores were comparable across treatment arms. TTD in GHS/QoL, physical functioning, fatigue, appetite loss, and abdominal pain was numerically longer for both STRIDE and durvalumab versus sorafenib. Clinically meaningful deterioration in PROs was not observed in any treatment arm. However, TTD in nausea and abdominal swelling was numerically longer for STRIDE versus sorafenib, and the likelihood of clinically meaningful improvement in GHS/QoL, role, emotional and social functioning, and disease-related symptoms was greater with STRIDE and durvalumab versus sorafenib. PROs with STRIDE and durvalumab were generally similar. CONCLUSION: Compared with sorafenib, STRIDE and durvalumab were associated with clinically meaningful, patient-centered GHS/QoL, functioning, and symptom benefits in people with uHCC. These findings support the benefits of the STRIDE regimen compared with sorafenib for a diverse population reflective of the global uHCC population.",True,Matches all PICOS criteria,patients with unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma,"STRIDE regimen, durvalumab",sorafenib,patient-reported outcomes including quality of life,randomized controlled trial,True,"Matches all PICOS criteria.

42,Development and evaluation of nomograms and risk stratification systems to predict the overall survival and cancer-specific survival of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma.,Kang X; Liu X; Li Y; Yuan W; Xu Y; Yan H,"Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the most common type of primary liver cancer, and patients with HCC have a poor prognosis and low survival rates. Establishing a prognostic nomogram is important for predicting the survival of patients with HCC, as it helps to improve the patient's prognosis. This study aimed to develop and evaluate nomograms and risk stratification to predict overall survival (OS) and cancer-specific survival (CSS) in HCC patients. Data from 10,302 patients with initially diagnosed HCC were extracted from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database between 2010 and 2017. Patients were randomly divided into the training and validation set. Kaplan-Meier survival, LASSO regression, and Cox regression analysis were conducted to select the predictors of OS. Competing risk analysis, LASSO regression, and Cox regression analysis were conducted to select the predictors of CSS. The validation of the nomograms was performed using the concordance index (C-index), the Akaike information criterion (AIC), the Bayesian information criterion (BIC), Net Reclassification Index (NRI), Discrimination Improvement (IDI), the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve, calibration curves, and decision curve analyses (DCAs). The results indicated that factors including age, grade, T stage, N stage, M stage, surgery, surgery to lymph node (LN), Alpha-Fetal Protein (AFP), and tumor size were independent predictors of OS, whereas grade, T stage, surgery, AFP, tumor size, and distant lymph node metastasis were independent predictors of CSS. Based on these factors, predictive models were built and virtualized by nomograms. The C-index for predicting 1-, 3-, and 5-year OS were 0.788, 0.792, and 0.790. The C-index for predicting 1-, 3-, and 5-year CSS were 0.803, 0.808, and 0.806. AIC, BIC, NRI, and IDI suggested that nomograms had an excellent predictive performance with no significant overfitting. The calibration curves showed good consistency of OS and CSS between the actual observation and nomograms prediction, and the DCA showed great clinical usefulness of the nomograms. The risk stratification of OS and CSS was built that could perfectly classify HCC patients into three risk groups. Our study developed nomograms and a corresponding risk stratification system predicting the OS and CSS of HCC patients.

The aim of this study was to construct and validate a novel nomogram model for predicting early relapse and survival after hepatectomy for HCC. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We conducted a large-scale, multicenter retrospective analysis of 1,505 patients with surgically treated HCC from 4 medical centers. All patients were randomly divided into either the training cohort (n=1,053) or the validation cohort (n=452) in a 7:3 ratio. A machine learning-based nomogram model for prediction of HCC was established by integrating multiple risk factors that influence early relapse and survival, which were identified from preoperative clinical data and postoperative pathologic characteristics of the patients. RESULTS: The median time to early relapse was 7 months, whereas the median time from early relapse to death was only 19 months. The concordance indexes of the postoperative nomogram for predicting disease-free survival and overall survival were 0.741 and 0.739, respectively, with well-calibrated curves demonstrating good consistency between predicted and observed outcomes. Moreover, the accuracy and predictive performance of the postoperative nomograms were significantly superior to those of the preoperative nomogram and the other 7 HCC staging systems. The patients in the intermediate- and high-risk groups of the model had significantly higher probabilities of early and critical recurrence (P<.001), whereas those in the low-risk group had higher probabilities of late and local recurrence (P<.001).

44,Impact of virtual reality education on disease-specific knowledge and anxiety for hepatocellular carcinoma patient scheduled for liver resection: a randomized controlled study.,Yang J; Rhu J; Lim S; Kang D; Lee H; Choi GS; Kim JM; Joh JW,"PURPOSE: Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a significant health concern, and the complexity of liver anatomy poses challenges in conveying radiologic findings and surgical plans to patients. This study aimed to evaluate the impact of a virtual reality (VR) education program on anxiety and knowledge in HCC patients undergoing hepatic resection. METHOD: From 1 January 2022 to 28 February 2023, 88 patients were enrolled in a randomized controlled trial, divided into the VR group ( n =44) and the control group ( n =44). The VR group received patient-specific 3D liver model education through a VR platform, while the control group underwent conventional explanation processes. Both groups completed preintervention and postintervention questionnaires assessing anxiety (using STAI-X-1, STAI-X-2, and VAS) and knowledge about liver resection. Comparison of the questionnaires were performed between the two groups. Multivariable logistic regression was performed to analyze factor related to decrease in anxiety. RESULT: While there was no significant difference in preintervention anxiety and knowledge scores between the two groups, the VR group exhibited significant reduction in STAI-X-1 scores (-4.14±7.5) compared to the control group (-0.84±5.7, P =0.023), as well as knowledge scores (17.20±2.6) compared to the control group (13.42±3.3, P <0.001). In the multivariable logistic regression model, VR education showed significant impact on decrease in STAI-X-1 score, postintervention. (OR=2.902, CI=1.097-7.674, P =0.032). CONCLUSION: The VR education program significantly improved knowledge and reduced anxiety among HCC patients compared to conventional methods.

45,Predicting Post-hepatectomy Liver Failure Preoperatively for Child-Pugh A5 Hepatocellular Carcinoma Patients by Liver Stiffness.,Huang J; Long H; Peng J; Zhong X; Shi Y; Xie X; Kuang M; Lin M,"BACKGROUND: Post-hepatectomy liver failure (PHLF) represents the major source of mortality after liver resection (LR) in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients. Child-Pugh (CP) score 5 is always considered to indicate a normal liver function but represents a heterogeneous population with a considerable number suffering from PHLF. The present study aimed to access the ability of liver stiffness (LS) measured by two-dimensional shear wave elastography (2D-SWE) to predict PHLF in HCC patients with a CP score of 5. METHODS: From August 2018 to May 2021, 146 HCC patients with a CP score of 5 who underwent LR were reviewed. The patients were randomly divided into training (n = 97) and validation (n = 49) groups. Logistic analyses were conducted for the risk factors and a linear model was built to predict the development of PHLF. The discrimination and calibration were assessed in the training and validation cohorts by the areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). RESULTS: Analyses revealed that the minimum of LS (Emin) higher than 8.05 (p = 0.006, OR = 4.59) and future liver remnant / estimated total liver volume (FLR/eTLV) (p < 0.001, OR < 0.01) were independent predictors of PHLF in HCC patients with CP score 5, and the AUC calculated by the model based on them for differentiation of PHLF in the training and validation group was 0.78 and 0.76, respectively. CONCLUSION: LS was associated with the development of PHLF.

However, survival remains poor with only a subset of patients deriving benefit. This trial investigated the safety and efficacy of stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) with immunotherapy in HCC. METHODS AND MATERIALS: In this multicenter phase 1 randomized trial, patients with advanced or unresectable HCC received liver SBRT (40 Gy in 5 fractions) followed by either nivolumab alone or nivolumab plus ipilimumab. The primary endpoint was dose-limiting toxicity occurring within 6 months of SBRT. Secondary endpoints included overall response rate, progression-free survival, overall survival (OS), distant disease control, and local control of the irradiated tumor. Disease status and response endpoints were assessed radiographically every 8 weeks until progression or initiation of nonprotocol therapy. Response was determined using both RECIST (Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors) 1.1 and iRECIST. RESULTS: Fourteen patients were enrolled across 3 centers. Thirteen patients were evaluated for study endpoints. The study was closed early because of slow accrual. The median follow-up time was 42.7 months. Dose-limiting toxicities within 6 months occurred in 2 (15.4%) of 13 patients: 1 of 6 patients in the nivolumab arm (16.7%; 90% confidence interval [CI], 0.9%-58.2%) and 1 of 7 patients in the nivolumab plus ipilimumab arm (14.3%; 90% CI, 0.7%-52.1%). Grade 3 adverse events occurred in 8 (61.6%), 5 (71.4%), and 3 (50.0%) patients in the overall nivolumab plus ipilimumab and nivolumab cohorts. Grade 3 hepatotoxicity occurred in 4 (30.8%), 3 (42.9%), and 1 (16.7%) patients in the respective cohorts. Clinical outcomes favored the nivolumab plus ipilimumab arm compared with nivolumab alone, including an overall response rate of 57% (4 of 7 patients; 90% CI, 23%-87%) versus 0% (0 of 6 patients; 90% CI, 0%-39%), median progression-free survival of 11.6 months (90% CI, 4.5 months to not reached) versus 2.7 months (90% CI, 1.3-4.7 months), and median OS of 41.6 months (90% CI, 4.5 months to not reached) versus 4.7 months (90% CI, 2.0-16.2 months) (all P < .05). With combination immunotherapy, 3-year OS was 57% (90% CI, 23%-81%), with 2 patients alive after 42.7 months without progression and negative PET.

Therefore, the authors aim to investigate whether neoadjuvant systemic therapy allows safely administered and effectively reduces post-LT recurrence for those patients. METHODS: In this prospective, randomized, open-label, pilot study, patients with HCC exceeding the MC were randomly assigned to PLENTY or control group before LT. The primary endpoint of the study was the recurrence-free survival after LT. RESULTS: Twenty-two patients were enrolled and randomly assigned: 11 to the PLENTY group and 11 to the control group. The 30-month tumor-specific RFS was 37.5% in the PLENTY group and 12.5% in the control group. The 12-month tumor-specific RFS after LT was significantly improved in the PLENTY group (87.5%) compared to the control group (37.5%) ( P =0·0022). The objective response rate in the PLENTY group was 30 and 60% when determined by RECIST 1.1 and mRECIST, respectively. Six patients (60%) had significant tumor necrosis, including three (30%) who had complete tumor necrosis at histopathology. No acute allograft rejection after LT occurred in the PLENTY and Control group. CONCLUSION: Neoadjuvant pembrolizumab plus lenvatinib before LT appears to be safe and feasible, associated with significantly better RFS for patients exceeding the MC.

OBJECTIVE: To investigate the feasibility of SBRT before deceased donor liver transplant (DDLT) for previously untreated unresectable HCC. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: In this phase 2 nonrandomized controlled trial conducted between June 1, 2015, and October 18, 2019, 32 eligible patients within UCSF (University of California, San Francisco) criteria underwent dual-tracer (18F-fluorodeoxyglucose and 11C-acetate [ACC]) positron emission tomography with computed tomography (PET-CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with gadoxetate followed by SBRT of 35 to 50 Gy in 5 fractions, and the same imaging afterward while awaiting DDLT. Statistical analysis was performed on an intention-to-treat basis between October 1 and 31, 2023. INTERVENTION: Patients received SBRT followed by DDLT when matched deceased donor grafts were available. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Coprimary end points were progression-free survival (PFS) and objective response rates (ORRs) by the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors, version 1.1 (RECIST 1.1), modified RECIST (mRECIST), and PET Response Criteria in Solid Tumors (PERCIST). Secondary end points were local control rate, overall survival (OS), and safety. RESULTS: A total of 32 patients (median age, 59 years [IQR, 54-63 years]; 22 men [68.8%]) with 56 lesions received SBRT. After a median follow-up of 74.6 months (IQR, 40.1-102.9 months), the median PFS was 17.6 months (95% CI, 6.6-28.6 months), and the median OS was 60.5 months (95% CI, 29.7-91.2 months). The 5-year PFS was 39.9% (95% CI, 19.9%-59.9%), and the 5-year OS was 51.3% (95% CI, 31.7%-70.9%). In terms of number of patients, ORRs were 62.5% ([n = 20] 95% CI, 54.2%-68.7%) by RECIST 1.1, 71.9% ([n = 23] 95% CI, 63.7%-79.0%) by mRECIST, and 78.1% ([n = 25] 95% CI, 73.2%-86.7%) by PERCIST. In terms of number of lesions, ORRs were 75.0% ([n = 42] 95% CI, 61.6%-80.8%) by RECIST 1.1, 83.9% ([n = 47] 95% CI, 74.7%-90.6%) by mRECIST, and 87.5% ([n = 49] 95% CI, 81.3%-98.6%) by PERCIST. Twenty patients with 36 lesions received DDLT, of whom 15 patients (75.0%) with 21 lesions (58.3%) exhibited pathologic complete response. Multivariable analyses revealed that pretreatment metabolic tumor volume (MTV) based on ACC (hazard ratio [HR], 1.06 [95% CI, 1.01-1.10]; P = .01) and complete metabolic response (CMR) by PERCIST (HR, 0.31 [95% CI, 0.10-0.96]; P = .04) were associated with PFS, while pretreatment MTV based on ACC (HR, 1.07 [95% CI, 1.03-1.16]; P = .01), total lesion activity based on ACC (HR, 1.01 [95% CI, 1.00-1.02]; P = .02), and CMR by PERCIST (HR, 0.21 [95% CI, 0.07-0.73]; P = .01) were associated with OS. Toxic effects associated with SBRT were reported for 9 patients (28.1%), with 1 grade 3 event.

50,Construction of web-based prediction nomogram models for cancer-specific survival in patients at stage IV of hepatocellular carcinoma depending on SEER database.,Zhan G; Cao P; Peng H,"OBJECTIVES: Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) prognosis involves multiple clinical factors. Although nomogram models targeting various clinical factors have been reported in early and locally advanced HCC, there are currently few studies on complete and effective prognostic nomogram models for stage IV HCC patients. This study aims to creat nomograms for cancer-specific survival (CSS) in patients at stage IV of HCC and developing a web predictive nomogram model to predict patient prognosis and guide individualized treatment. METHODS: Clinicopathological information on stage IV of HCC between January, 2010 and December, 2015 was collected from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database. The patients at stage IV of HCC were categorized into IVA (without distant metastases) and IVB (with distant metastases) subgroups based on the presence of distant metastasis, and then the patients from both IVA and IVB subgroups were randomly divided into the training and validation cohorts in a 7꞉3 ratio. Univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses were used to analyze the independent risk factors that significantly affected CSS in the training cohort, and constructed nomogram models separately for stage IVA and stage IVB patients based on relevant independent risk factors. Two nomogram's accuracy and discrimination were evaluated by receiver operator characteristic (ROC) curves and calibration curves. Furthermore, web-based nomogram models were developed specifically for stage IVA and stage IVB HCC patients by R software. A decision analysis curve (DCA) was used to evaluate the clinical utility of the web-based nomogram models. RESULTS: A total of 3 060 patients were included in this study, of which 883 were in stage IVA, and 2 177 were in stage IVB. Based on multivariate analysis results, tumor size, alpha-fetoprotein (AFP), T stage, histological grade, surgery, radiotherapy, and chemotherapy were independent prognostic factors for patients with stage IVA of HCC; and tumor size, AFP, T stage, N stage, histological grade, lung metastasis, surgery, radiotherapy, and chemotherapy were independent prognostic factors for patients with stage IVB HCC. In stage IVA patients, the 3-, 6-, 9-, 12-, 15-, and 18-month areas under the ROC curves for the training cohort were 0.823, 0.800, 0.772, 0.784, 0.784, and 0.786, respectively; and the 3-, 6-, 9-, 12-, 15-, and 18-month areas under the ROC curves for the validation cohort were 0.793, 0.764, 0.739, 0.773, 0.798, and 0.799, respectively. In stage IVB patients, the 3-, 6-, 9-, and 12-month areas under the ROC curves for the training cohort were 0.756, 0.750, 0.755, and 0.743, respectively; and the 3-, 6-, 9-, and 12-month areas under the ROC curves for the validation cohort were 0.744, 0.747, 0.775, and 0.779, respectively; showing that the nomograms had an excellent predictive ability.

Herein, we aimed to validate objective response as an independent predictor of OS in individuals with unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) receiving systemic anti-angiogenic therapy. METHODS: We investigated the association between objective response (investigator-assessed mRECIST, independent radiologic review [IRR] mRECIST and RECIST v1.1) and OS in REFLECT, a phase III study of lenvatinib vs. sorafenib. We conducted landmark analyses (Simon-Makuch) of OS by objective response at 2, 4, and 6 months after randomization. RESULTS: Median OS was 21.6 months (95% CI 18.6-24.5) for responders (investigator-assessed mRECIST) vs. 11.9 months (95% CI 10.7-12.8) for non-responders (hazard ratio [HR] 0.61; 95% CI 0.49-0.76; p <0.001). Objective response by IRR per mRECIST and RECIST v1.1 supported the association with OS (HR 0.61; 95% CI 0.51-0.72; p <0.001 and HR 0.50; 95% CI 0.39-0.65; p <0.001, respectively). OS was significantly prolonged for responders vs. non-responders (investigator-assessed mRECIST) at the 2-month (HR 0.61; 95% CI 0.49-0.76; p <0.001), 4-month (HR 0.63; 95% CI 0.51-0.80; p <0.001), and 6-month (HR 0.68; 95% CI 0.54-0.86; p <0.001) landmarks. Results were similar when assessed by IRR, with both mRECIST and RECIST v1.1. An exploratory multivariate Cox regression analysis identified objective response by investigator-assessed mRECIST (HR 0.55; 95% CI 0.44-0.68; p <0.0001) and IRR-assessed RECIST v1.1 (HR 0.49; 95% CI, 0.38-0.64; p <0.0001) as independent predictors of OS in individuals with unresectable HCC. CONCLUSIONS: Objective response was an independent predictor of OS in individuals with unresectable HCC in REFLECT; additional studies are needed to confirm surrogacy. Participants achieving a complete or partial response by mRECIST or RECIST v1.1 had significantly longer survival vs. those with stable/progressive/non-evaluable disease. GOV NUMBER: NCT01761266. IMPACT AND IMPLICATIONS: This analysis of data taken from a completed clinical trial (REFLECT) looked for any link between objective response and overall survival time in individuals with unresectable HCC receiving anti-angiogenic treatments. Significantly longer median overall survival was found for responders (21.6 months) vs. non-responders (11.9 months). Overall survival was also significantly longer for responders vs. non-responders (based on objective response status at 2, 4, and 6 months) in the landmark analysis. Our results indicate that objective response is an independent predictor of overall survival in this setting, confirming its validity as a rapid marker of efficacy that can be applied in phase II trials; however, further validation is required to determine is validity for other systemic treatments (e.g. immunotherapies), or as a surrogate of overall survival.",False,"Does not match target criteria: intervention is not immunotherapy or targeted therapy, no comparison, not a randomized controlled trial.",individuals with unresectable HCC,systemic anti-angiogenic therapy,not specified,overall survival,phase III study,False,"While it involves anti-angiogenic therapy, there is no direct comparison to immunotherapy or targeted therapy.

52,Nonadherence to oral cancer chemotherapy in hepatocellular carcinoma: prevalence and predictive factors in Vietnam.,Ky TD; Loan NT; Thinh NT; Binh MT,"PURPOSE: Standard oral cancer chemotherapy (OCT) or targeted therapy (OTT) has expanded the treatment methods for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). However, its principal nonadherence causes a reduction in efficacy. We aimed to evaluate the status of nonadherence and influencing factors among outpatient patients with HCC. PATIENTS AND METHODS: In 2021, a prospective observational study was conducted on 384 patients with either old or newly diagnosed HCC treated with OTT. Nonadherence to OCT was determined using the eight-item Morisky Medication Adherence Scale, with a score < 6 points. The patients were finished with a six-month follow-up investigation by questionnaires. RESULTS: 54,8% of HCC outpatients were nonadherent to OCT, with a mean Morisky score of 5.19. They dropped out of the treatment mainly because of drug side effects, such as fatigue (72.4%), hand-foot syndrome (42.7%), diarrhea (38.3%), nausea (25%), insomnia (24.7%), abdominal pain (12%), and anxiety about these adverse events (65.9%). Additionally, financial difficulties and low relative copayments were significantly correlated with the noncompliant treatment of patients (OR = 2.29, 95% CI = 1.32-3.98, P = 0.003; OR = 4.36, 95% CI = 0.95-19.93, P = 0.039, respectively). Moreover, inadequate individual information about the clinical course, the art of treatment, and medication usage instructions were suggestive barriers to adherence to treatment (OR = 1.96, 95% CI = 1.08-3.55, P = 0.024; OR = 1.86, 95% CI = 1.1-3.14, P = 0.02; OR = 2.34, 95% CI = 1.29-4.26, P = 0.004, respectively). Finally, a low level of trust in doctors was an essential factor in nonadherence (Mean of the Anderson Trust in Physician Scale scores counted 38.12 vs. 43.97, respectively for non-adherence vs. adherence, P = 0.00001). CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests a high rate of primary nonadherence to standard oral targeted therapy among HCC outpatient patients because of drug side effects, patient awareness of treatment, and lack of confidence in healthcare providers. Close supervision, proper medication instructions, appropriate dosage reductions, and comprehensive patient counseling might be necessary to control nonadherence.",False,"Does not match target criteria: no comparison, outcome is not survival or response rate, not a randomized controlled trial.",outpatient patients with HCC,oral targeted therapy,not specified,nonadherence status,prospective observational study,False,The study focuses on nonadherence to oral targeted therapy rather than survival or response rates.

In the initial analysis, cabozantinib plus atezolizumab significantly prolonged progression-free survival versus sorafenib. Here, we report the pre-planned final overall survival analysis and updated safety and efficacy results following longer follow-up. METHODS: COSMIC-312 was an open-label, randomised, phase 3 study done across 178 centres in 32 countries. Patients aged 18 years or older with previously untreated advanced hepatocellular carcinoma were eligible. Patients must have had measurable disease per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumours version 1.1 (RECIST 1.1), and adequate marrow and organ function, including Child-Pugh class A liver function; those with fibrolamellar carcinoma, sarcomatoid hepatocellular carcinoma, or combined hepatocellular cholangiocarcinoma were ineligible. Patients were randomly assigned (2:1:1) using a web-based interactive response system to a combination of oral cabozantinib 40 mg once daily plus intravenous atezolizumab 1200 mg every 3 weeks, oral sorafenib 400 mg twice daily, or oral single-agent cabozantinib 60 mg once daily. Randomisation was stratified by disease aetiology, geographical region, and presence of extrahepatic disease or macrovascular invasion. Dual primary endpoints were for cabozantinib plus atezolizumab versus sorafenib: progression-free survival per RECIST 1.1, as assessed by a blinded independent radiology committee, in the first 372 randomly assigned patients (previously reported) and overall survival in all patients randomly assigned to cabozantinib plus atezolizumab or sorafenib. The secondary endpoint was progression-free survival in all patients randomly assigned to cabozantinib versus sorafenib. Outcomes in all randomly assigned patients, including final overall survival, are presented. Safety was assessed in all randomly assigned patients who received at least one dose of study drug. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03755791. FINDINGS: Between Dec 7, 2018, and Aug 27, 2020, 432 patients were randomly assigned to combination treatment, 217 to sorafenib, and 188 to single-agent cabozantinib, and included in all efficacy analyses. 704 (84%) patients were male and 133 (16%) were female. 824 of these patients received at least one dose of study treatment and were included in the safety population. Median follow-up was 22·1 months (IQR 19·3-24·8). Median overall survival was 16·5 months (96% CI 14·5-18·7) for the combination treatment group and 15·5 months (12·2-20·0) for the sorafenib group (hazard ratio [HR] 0·98 [0·78-1·24]; stratified log-rank p=0·87). Median progression-free survival was 6·9 months (99% CI 5·7-8·2) for the combination treatment group, 4·3 months (2·9-6·1) for the sorafenib group, and 5·8 months (99% CI 5·4-8·2) for the single-agent cabozantinib group (HR 0·74 [0·56-0·97] for combination treatment vs sorafenib; HR 0·78 [99% CI 0·56-1·09], p=0·05, for single-agent cabozantinib vs sorafenib). Grade 3 or 4 adverse events occurred in 281 (66%) of 429 patients in the combination treatment group, 100 (48%) of 207 patients in the sorafenib group, and 108 (57%) of 188 patients in the single-agent cabozantinib group; the most common were hypertension (37 [9%] vs 17 [8%] vs 23 [12%]), palmar-plantar erythrodysaesthesia (36 [8%] vs 18 [9%] vs 16 [9%]), aspartate aminotransferase increased (42 [10%] vs eight [4%] vs 17 [9%]), and alanine aminotransferase increased (40 [9%] vs six [3%] vs 13 [7%]). Serious adverse events occurred in 223 (52%) patients in the combination treatment group, 84 (41%) patients in the sorafenib group, and 87 (46%) patients in the single agent cabozantinib group. Treatment-related deaths occurred in six (1%) patients in the combination treatment group (encephalopathy, hepatic failure, drug-induced liver injury, oesophageal varices haemorrhage, multiple organ dysfunction syndrome, and tumour lysis syndrome), one (<1%) in the sorafenib group (general physical health deterioration), and four (2%) in the single-agent cabozantinib group (asthenia, gastrointestinal haemorrhage, sepsis, and gastric perforation). INTERPRETATION: First-line cabozantinib plus atezolizumab did not improve overall survival versus sorafenib in patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma. The progression-free survival benefit of the combination versus sorafenib was maintained, with no new safety signals.

54,Spleen to non-cancerous liver volume ratio predicts liver cirrhosis in hepatocellular carcinoma patients.,Geng Y; Shao WQ; Lin J,"PURPOSE: To investigate the performance of spleen to non-cancerous liver volume ratio (STnLR) for diagnosing liver cirrhosis in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) during preoperative evaluation. METHODS: Patients were randomly divided into experiment group and validation group. Patients were grouped into cirrhosis group and non-cirrhosis group according to Scheuer staging. Patients' routine image data were reconstructed using a three-dimensional system. STnLR, spleen to liver volume ratio (STLR), spleen volume, aspartate aminotransferase to platelet ratio index (APRI), and fibrosis index based on the four factors (FIB-4) were calculated. Correlations between indices and cirrhosis were measured by Spearman correlation analysis. Diagnostic performance was assessed and compared using receiver operating characteristic analysis. Accuracies of the models were analyzed in validation group. RESULTS: No statistical difference in demographic and clinical characteristics was observed between groups. In experiment group, STnLR had the strongest correlation (r = 0.5399, P < 0.0001), and STLR, spleen volume, APRI, and FIB-4 had moderate correlations (r = 0.4583, 0.4123, 0.3648, and 0.3405, P < 0.0001, < 0.0001, < 0.0001, and = 0.0002) with liver cirrhosis stage. AUROC of STnLR (0.8326) was not statistically higher than that for spleen volume (0.7542, P = 0.09832) and STLR (0.8046, P = 0.3034), but was significantly higher than that for APRI (0.7099, P = 0.02046) and FIB-4 (0.7294, P = 0.03987). In validation group, STnLR showed the highest AUROC value (0.8538) and highest Youden index (0.5869) among all models. CONCLUSION: STnLR is an accurate and stable volumetric model to diagnose hepatic cirrhosis in the HCC population, which is superior to APRI and FIB-4.

Sorafenib, an oral multi kinase inhibitor also promotes apoptosis and inhibits tumor angiogenesis. The efficacy of either agent alone is limited; however, preclinical studies demonstrate synergy with the combination of navitoclax and sorafenib. In this phase 1 study, we evaluated the combination of navitoclax and sorafenib in a dose escalation cohort of patients with refractory solid tumors, with an expansion cohort in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Maximum tolerated dose (MTD) was determined using the continual reassessment method. Navitoclax and sorafenib were administered continuously on days 1 through 21 of 21-day cycles. Ten patients were enrolled in the dose escalation cohort and 15 HCC patients were enrolled in the expansion cohort. Two dose levels were tested, and the MTD was navitoclax 150 mg daily plus sorafenib 400 mg twice daily. Among all patients, the most common grade 3 toxicity was thrombocytopenia (5 patients, 20%): there were no grade 4 or 5 toxicities. Patients received a median of 2 cycles (range 1-36 cycles) and all patients were off study treatment at data cut off. Six patients in the expansion cohort had stable disease, and there were no partial or complete responses. Drug-drug interaction between navitoclax and sorafenib was not observed. The combination of navitoclax and sorafenib did not increase induction of apoptosis compared with navitoclax alone. Navitoclax plus sorafenib is tolerable but showed limited efficacy in the HCC expansion cohort.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: In this biomolecular exploratory, phase II trial, eligible patients underwent the triple combination therapy of lenvatinib, toripalimab, plus FOLFOX chemotherapy. Primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS) rate at 6 months by RECIST v1.1. Single-nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq) of tumor biopsy samples was performed for exploratory biomarker analyses. RESULTS: Between November 19, 2019, and July 4, 2021, 30 patients were enrolled. The primary endpoint was a 6-month PFS rate of 66.7%, with a median PFS of 9.73 months [95% confidence interval (CI), 2.89-16.58]. The median overall survival (OS) was 14.63 months (95% CI, 11.77-17.50), with an objective response rate of 43.3%. Twenty-four (80.0%) patients exhibited high-risk features, among whom the median OS and PFS were 13.7 months (95% CI, 9.24-18.16) and 8.3 months (95% CI, 3.02-13.58), respectively.

58,Antidepressant Use and Mortality Among Patients With Hepatocellular Carcinoma.,Huang KL; Chen YL; Stewart R; Chen VC,"IMPORTANCE: Liver cancer, primarily hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), is the third leading cause of cancer deaths worldwide. Although some studies have proposed that antidepressants may have apoptotic effects on cancer, no study has examined the association between antidepressant use and HCC prognosis. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the association between antidepressant use and mortality risk in patients with HCC. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This population-based cohort study analyzed Taiwan's National Health Insurance Research Database, which covers 99% of Taiwan's population and includes comprehensive medical information. Patients with a new diagnosis of HCC between 1999 and 2017 were identified. Analysis took place in June 2023. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: All patients with HCC were followed up until 2018 to measure overall and cancer-specific mortality. To examine whether the timing of antidepressant use influenced the association with mortality, antidepressant use was examined before and after HCC diagnosis. Cox proportional hazards regression was performed to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) and the 95% CIs for the association between antidepressant use and overall mortality and cancer-specific mortality. RESULTS: The study cohort comprised 308 938 participants, primarily consisting of older individuals (131 991 [42.7%] were aged ≥65 years) with a higher proportion of male individuals (202 589 [65.6%]). Antidepressant use before the diagnosis of HCC was not associated with lower risks of overall mortality (adjusted HR, 1.10; 95% CI, 1.08-1.12) and cancer-specific mortality (adjusted HR, 1.06; 95% CI, 0.96-1.17). However, antidepressant use after a diagnosis of HCC was associated with a lower risk of overall mortality (adjusted HR, 0.69; 95% CI, 0.68-0.70) and cancer-specific mortality (adjusted HR, 0.63; 95% CI, 0.59-0.68). The observed associations were consistent across subgroups with different antidepressant classes and comorbidities, including hepatitis B virus or hepatitis C virus infection, liver cirrhosis, and alcohol use disorders.

59,National Liver Cancer Screening Trial (TRACER) study protocol.,Singal AG; Parikh ND; Kanwal F; Marrero JA; Deodhar S; Page-Lester S; Lopez C; Feng Z; Tayob N,"BACKGROUND: Professional guidelines recommend HCC screening in at-risk patients using semi-annual ultrasound with or without alpha-fetoprotein (AFP); however, this strategy has limited effectiveness due to low adherence and sensitivity. Increasing data support the potential role of blood-based biomarker panels, which could improve both aspects. The biomarker panel GALAD, comprised of sex, age, and 3 blood biomarkers (AFP, AFP-L3, and des-carboxy prothrombin des-carboxy prothrombin), has shown high sensitivity and specificity in biomarker phase II (case-control) and phase III (retrospective cohort) validation studies. However, prospective validation in a large phase IV biomarker clinical utility trial is necessary before its adoption in practice. METHODS: The National Liver Cancer Screening Trial is an adaptive pragmatic randomized phase IV trial, which began enrollment in January 2024, comparing ultrasound-based versus biomarker-based screening in 5500 patients with chronic hepatitis B infection or cirrhosis from any etiology. Eligible patients are randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to semi-annual screening with ultrasound ± alpha-fetoprotein (arm A) or semi-annual screening with GALAD (arm B). Randomization is stratified by enrollment site, liver disease severity (per Child-Pugh class), liver disease etiology (viral, nonviral, and noncirrhotic HBV), and sex. Patients are being recruited from 15 sites (a mix of tertiary care academic referral centers, safety-net health systems, and large community health systems) over a 3-year period, and the primary endpoint, reduction in late-stage HCC, will be assessed at the end of year 5.5. DISCUSSION: The results of this trial will inform the best strategy for HCC screening and early-stage detection in patients with chronic liver diseases. If GALAD shows superiority, HCC screening would primarily shift from an ultrasound-based strategy to the adoption of the biomarker panel. TRIAL REGISTRATION: NCT06084234.

This study aims to evaluate the clinical and cost effectiveness of an intervention involving a suite of strategies designed to assess and treat palliative care symptoms and needs in adult outpatients with HCC attending four New South Wales (NSW) metropolitan tertiary hospitals. METHODS: This trial will use a pragmatic cluster-based randomised-controlled design, with ambulatory HCC services as the clusters. HCC patients will be recruited if they have Barcelona Clinical Liver Cancer (BCLC) stage A disease with active tumour or a current or prior diagnosis of BCLC stage B or C disease regardless of tumour activity. Patients with BCLC stage D disease will be excluded as palliative care is the standard of care (SOC) in this group. Cluster sites will be randomised to the study intervention or control where patients are managed according to SOC. All participants will complete the liver-specific Edmonton Symptom Assessment Scale (ESAS) and European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire at regular ambulatory clinic appointments. At intervention sites, patients scoring ≥ 5 on any liver-specific ESAS symptom will be referred to palliative care physicians for consultation. The primary clinical outcome will be improvement in all symptoms scored ≥ 5 on the liver-specific ESAS by 50% within 3 months and the primary implementation outcome will recording the liver-specific ESAS in ≥ 80% of all participants attending clinic appointments. Caregivers of patients enrolled in the trial will be invited to perform Carer Support Needs Assessment Tool at each appointment. DISCUSSION: This trial will inform if earlier palliative care involvement significantly reduces the symptom burden associated with HCC. If found to be effective, earlier implementation of palliative care consultation should be included in HCC treatment guidelines. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ACTRN12623000010695.

Patterns of cause-specific mortality are evolving as the population with HIV ages. We aimed to investigate longitudinal trends in cause-specific mortality among people with HIV starting ART in Europe and North America. METHODS: In this collaborative observational cohort study, we used data from 17 European and North American HIV cohorts contributing data to the Antiretroviral Therapy Cohort Collaboration. We included data for people with HIV who started ART between 1996 and 2020 at the age of 16 years or older. Causes of death were classified into a single cause by both a clinician and an algorithm if International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision or Tenth Revision data were available, or independently by two clinicians. Disagreements were resolved through panel discussion. We used Poisson models to compare cause-specific mortality rates during the calendar periods 1996-99, 2000-03, 2004-07, 2008-11, 2012-15, and 2016-20, adjusted for time-updated age, CD4 count, and whether the individual was ART-naive at the start of each period. FINDINGS: Among 189 301 people with HIV included in this study, 16 832 (8·9%) deaths were recorded during 1 519 200 person-years of follow-up. 13 180 (78·3%) deaths were classified by cause: the most common causes were AIDS (4203 deaths; 25·0%), non-AIDS non-hepatitis malignancy (2311; 13·7%), and cardiovascular or heart-related (1403; 8·3%) mortality. The proportion of deaths due to AIDS declined from 49% during 1996-99 to 16% during 2016-20. Rates of all-cause mortality per 1000 person-years decreased from 16·8 deaths (95% CI 15·4-18·4) during 1996-99 to 7·9 deaths (7·6-8·2) during 2016-20. Rates of all-cause mortality declined with time: the average adjusted mortality rate ratio per calendar period was 0·85 (95% CI 0·84-0·86). Rates of cause-specific mortality also declined: the most pronounced reduction was for AIDS-related mortality (0·81; 0·79-0·83). There were also reductions in rates of cardiovascular-related (0·83, 0·79-0·87), liver-related (0·88, 0·84-0·93), non-AIDS infection-related (0·91, 0·86-0·96), non-AIDS-non-hepatocellular carcinoma malignancy-related (0·94, 0·90-0·97), and suicide or accident-related mortality (0·89, 0·82-0·95). Mortality rates among people who acquired HIV through injecting drug use increased in women (1·07, 1·00-1·14) and decreased slightly in men (0·96, 0·93-0·99). INTERPRETATION: Reductions of most major causes of death, particularly AIDS-related deaths among people with HIV on ART, were not seen for all subgroups. Interventions targeted at high-risk groups, substance use, and comorbidities might further increase life expectancy in people with HIV towards that in the general population.

62,Tumor burden score-AFP-albumin-bilirubin grade score predicts the survival of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma after liver resection.,Qiu ZC; Li C; Zhang Y; Xie F; Yu Y; Leng SS; Chen TH; Wen TF,"PURPOSE: There is little information regarding the overall survival (OS) predictive ability of the combination of tumor burden score (TBS), α-fetoprotein (AFP), and albumin-bilirubin (ALBI) grade for patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Here, we aimed to develop a model including TBS, AFP, and ALBI grade to predict HCC patient OS following liver resection. METHODS: Patients (N = 1556) from six centers were randomly divided 1:1 into training and validation sets. The X-Tile software was used to determine the optimal cutoff values. The time-dependent area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) was calculated to assess the prognostic ability of the different models. RESULTS: In the training set, tumor differentiation, TBS, AFP, ALBI grade, and Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC) stage were independently related to OS. According to the coefficient values of TBS, AFP, and ALBI grade, we developed the TBS-AFP-ALBI (TAA) score using a simplified point system (0, 2 for low/high TBS, 0, 1 for low/high AFP and 0,1 for ALBI grade 1/2). Patients were further divided into low TAA (TAA ≤ 1), medium TAA (TAA = 2-3), and high TAA (TAA= 4) groups. TAA scores (low: referent; medium, HR = 1.994, 95% CI = 1.492-2.666; high, HR = 2.413, 95% CI = 1.630-3.573) were independently associated with patient survival in the validation set. The TAA scores showed higher AUROCs than BCLC stage for the prediction of 1-, 3-, and 5-year OS in both the training and validation sets. CONCLUSION: TAA is a simple score that has better OS prediction performance than the BCLC stage in predicting OS for HCC patients after liver resection. part of Springer Nature.",False,"Intervention is surgical, not immunotherapy or targeted therapy; study design is not RCT.",patients with hepatocellular carcinoma,liver resection,not specified,overall survival,retrospective study,False,"The intervention is liver resection, not immunotherapy or targeted therapy.

Purpose To compare two-dimensional (2D) and three-dimensional (3D) CE US diagnostic performance with that of CE MRI or CT, the current clinical standard, in the detection of residual viable HCC after transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) in a prospective multicenter trial. Materials and Methods Participants aged at least 21 years with US-visible HCC scheduled for TACE were consecutively enrolled at one of three participating academic medical centers from May 2016 to March 2022. Each underwent baseline 2D and 3D CE US before TACE, 2D and 3D CE US 1-2 weeks and/or 4-6 weeks after TACE, and CE MRI or CT 4-6 weeks after TACE. CE US and CE MRI or CT were evaluated by three fellowship-trained radiologists for the presence or absence of viable tumors and were compared with reference standards of pathology (18%), angiography on re-treatment after identification of residual disease at 1-2-month follow-up imaging (31%), 4-8-month CE MRI or CT (42%), or short-term (approximately 1-2 months) CE MRI or CT if clinically decompensated and estimated viability was greater than 50% at imaging (9%). Diagnostic performance criteria, including sensitivity and specificity, were obtained for each modality and time point with generalized estimating equation analysis. Results A total of 132 participants were included (mean age, 64 years ± 7 [SD], 87 male). Sensitivity of 2D CE US 4-6 weeks after TACE was 91% (95% CI: 84, 95), which was higher than that of CE MRI or CT (68%; 95% CI: 58, 76; P < .001). Sensitivity of 3D CE US 4-6 weeks after TACE was 89% (95% CI: 81, 94), which was higher than that of CE MRI or CT (P < .001), with no evidence of a difference from 2D CE US (P = .22). CE MRI or CT had 85% (95% CI: 76, 91) specificity, higher than that of 4-6-week 2D and 3D CE US (70% [95% CI: 56, 80] and 67% [95% CI: 53, 78], respectively; P = .046 and P = .023, respectively). No evidence of differences in any diagnostic criteria were observed between 1-2-week and 4-6-week 2D CE US (P > .21). Conclusion The 2D and 3D CE US examinations 4-6 weeks after TACE revealed higher sensitivity in the detection of residual HCC than CE MRI or CT, albeit with lower specificity.

Therefore, we compared its postoperative complications and long-term outcomes between younger and older adult patients. METHODS: Patients who underwent hepatectomies for hepatocellular carcinoma (N = 883) were evaluated. Patients were divided into two groups: aged < 75 years (N = 593) and ≥ 75 years (N = 290). Short-term outcomes and prognoses were compared between the groups in the entire cohort. The same analyses were performed for the major hepatectomy cohort. RESULTS: In the entire cohort, no significant differences were found in complications between patients aged < 75 and ≥ 75 years, and the multivariate analysis did not reveal age as a prognostic factor for postoperative complications. However, overall survival was significantly worse in older patients, although no significant differences were noted in time to recurrence or cancer-specific survival. In the multivariate analyses of time to recurrence, overall survival, and cancer-specific survival, although older age was an independent poor prognostic factor for overall survival, it was not a prognostic factor for time to recurrence and cancer-specific survival. In the major hepatectomy subgroup, short- and long-term outcomes, including time to recurrence, overall survival, and cancer-specific survival, did not differ significantly between the age groups. In the multivariate analysis, age was not a significant prognostic factor for complications, time to recurrence, overall survival, or cancer-specific survival.

A previous retrospective study suggested that TACE plus sorafenib (SOR-TACE) may be a better therapeutic option compared with TACE alone. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the clinical outcomes of SOR-TACE vs TACE alone for patients with recurrent intermediate-stage HCC after R0 hepatectomy with positive MVI. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: In this phase 3, open-label, multicenter randomized clinical trial, patients with recurrent intermediate-stage HCC and positive MVI were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio via a computerized minimization technique to either SOR-TACE treatment or TACE alone. This trial was conducted at 5 hospitals in China, and enrolled patients from October 2019 to December 2021, with a follow-up period of 24 months. Data were analyzed from June 2023 to September 2023. INTERVENTIONS: Randomization to on-demand TACE (conventional TACE: doxorubicin, 50 mg, mixed with lipiodol and gelatin sponge particles [diameter: 150-350 μm]; drug-eluting bead TACE: doxorubicin, 75 mg, mixed with drug-eluting particles [diameter: 100-300 μm or 300-500 μm]) (TACE group) or sorafenib, 400 mg, twice daily plus on-demand TACE (SOR-TACE group) (conventional TACE: doxorubicin, 50 mg, mixed with lipiodol and gelatin sponge particles [diameter, 150-350 μm]; drug-eluting bead TACE: doxorubicin, 75 mg, mixed with drug-eluting particles [diameter: 100-300 μm or 300-500 μm]). MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary end point was overall survival by intention-to-treat analysis. Safety was assessed in patients who received at least 1 dose of study treatment. RESULTS: A total of 162 patients (median [range] age, 55 [28-75] years; 151 males [93.2%]), were randomly assigned to be treated with either SOR-TACE (n = 81) or TACE alone (n = 81). The median overall survival was significantly longer in the SOR-TACE group than in the TACE group (22.2 months vs 15.1 months; hazard ratio [HR], 0.55; P < .001). SOR-TACE also prolonged progression-free survival (16.2 months vs 11.8 months; HR, 0.54; P < .001), and improved the objective response rate when compared with TACE alone based on the modified Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors criteria (80.2% vs 58.0%; P = .002). Any grade adverse events were more common in the SOR-TACE group, but all adverse events responded well to treatment. No unexpected adverse events or treatment-related deaths occurred in this study. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: The results of this randomized clinical trial demonstrated that SOR-TACE achieved better clinical outcomes than TACE alone. These findings suggest that combined treatment should be used for patients with recurrent intermediate-stage HCC after R0 hepatectomy with positive MVI.

Here, we present 5-year results from this cohort. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients were randomized 1 : 1 : 1 to arm A [nivolumab 1 mg/kg plus ipilimumab 3 mg/kg Q3W (four doses)] or arm B [nivolumab 3 mg/kg plus ipilimumab 1 mg/kg Q3W (four doses)], each followed by nivolumab 240 mg Q2W, or arm C (nivolumab 3 mg/kg Q2W plus ipilimumab 1 mg/kg Q6W). The primary objectives were safety, tolerability, investigator-assessed objective response rate (ORR), and duration of response (DOR) per RECIST version 1.1. RESULTS: A total of 148 patients were randomized across treatment arms. At 60-month minimum follow-up (62.6-month median follow-up), the ORR was 34% (n = 17), 27% (n = 13), and 29% (n = 14) in arms A, B, and C, respectively. The median DOR was 51.2 months [95% confidence interval (CI) 12.6 months-not estimable (NE)], 15.2 months (95% CI 7.1 months-NE), and 21.7 months (95% CI 4.2 months-NE), respectively.

Currently, there are only a few therapeutic methods available for patients with advanced HCC and extrahepatic metastasis (EHM). Systemic chemotherapy, such as FOLFOX4 (infusions of fluorouracil, leucovorin, and oxaliplatin), has been reported for treating advanced HCC with EHM, but its effectiveness is very poor. In this randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study, we aimed to assess the efficacy and safety of FOLFOX4 with all-trans-retinoic acid (ATRA) as a palliative treatment for HCC patients with EHM, compared to FOLFOX4 with a placebo. The primary endpoint was overall survival (OS), and subsequently, an exploratory model was developed based on bioinformatics to predict the efficacy of FOLFOX4-ATRA treatment. A total of 108 patients were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive either FOLFOX4-ATRA or FOLFOX4-placebo. The intention-to-treat (ITT) population showed a median OS of 16.2 months for the FOLFOX4-ATRA group, compared with 10.7 months for the FOLFOX4-placebo group (HR 0.56, 95% CI 0.33-0.93; p = 0.025).

A panoramic understanding of its tumor evolution, in relation to its clinical trajectory, may provide novel prognostic and treatment strategies. METHODS: Through the Asia-Pacific Hepatocellular Carcinoma trials group (NCT03267641), we recruited one of the largest prospective cohorts of patients with HCC, with over 600 whole genome and transcriptome samples from 123 treatment-naïve patients. RESULTS: Using a multi-region sampling approach, we revealed seven convergent genetic evolutionary paths governed by the early driver mutations, late copy number variations and viral integrations, which stratify patient clinical trajectories after surgical resection. Furthermore, such evolutionary paths shaped the molecular profiles, leading to distinct transcriptomic subtypes. Most significantly, although we found the coexistence of multiple transcriptomic subtypes within certain tumors, patient prognosis was best predicted by the most aggressive cell fraction of the tumor, rather than by overall degree of transcriptomic ITH level - a phenomenon we termed the 'bad apple' effect. Finally, we found that characteristics throughout early and late tumor evolution provide significant and complementary prognostic power in predicting patient survival. CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, our study generated a comprehensive landscape of evolutionary history for HCC and provides a rich multi-omics resource for understanding tumor heterogeneity and clinical trajectories. IMPACT AND IMPLICATIONS: This prospective study, utilizing comprehensive multi-sector, multi-omics sequencing and clinical data from surgically resected hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), reveals critical insights into the role of tumor evolution and intra-tumor heterogeneity (ITH) in determining the prognosis of HCC. These findings are invaluable for oncology researchers and clinicians, as they underscore the influence of distinct evolutionary paths and the 'bad apple' effect, where the most aggressive tumor fraction dictates disease progression. These insights not only enhance prognostic accuracy post-surgical resection but also pave the way for personalized treatment strategies tailored to specific tumor evolutionary and transcriptomic profiles. The coexistence of multiple subtypes within the same tumor prompts a re-appraisal of the utilities of depending on single samples to represent the entire tumor and suggests the need for clinical molecular imaging. This research thus marks a significant step forward in the clinical understanding and management of HCC, underscoring the importance of integrating tumor evolutionary dynamics and multi-omics biomarkers into therapeutic decision-making.

METHODS: We included 98,786 postmenopausal women from the Women's Health Initiative-Observational Study and the usual diet arm of the Diet Modification trial. The DRRD score was derived from eight factors: high intakes of dietary fiber, coffee, nuts, polyunsaturated fatty acids, low intakes of red and processed meat, foods with high glycemic index, sugar-sweetened beverages (SSBs), and trans fat based on a validated Food-Frequency Questionnaire administered at baseline (1993-1998). Multivariable hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for liver cancer incidence and chronic liver disease mortality were estimated using Cox proportional hazards regression models. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: After a median follow-up of 22.0 years, 216 incident liver cancer cases and 153 chronic liver disease deaths were confirmed. A higher DRRD score was significantly associated with a reduced risk of developing liver cancer (HR(Tertile 3 vs. Tertile 1) = 0.69; 95% CI: 0.49-0.97; P(trend) = 0.03) and chronic liver disease mortality (HR(T3 vs. T1) = 0.54; 95% CI: 0.35-0.82; P(trend) = 0.003).

Here, we report the efficacy and safety of combining toripalimab, lenvatinib, and gemcitabine plus oxaliplatin (GEMOX) as first-line therapy for advanced ICC. Thirty patients with pathologically confirmed advanced ICC received intravenous gemcitabine (1 g/m(2)) on Days 1 and 8 and oxaliplatin (85 mg/m(2)) Q3W for six cycles along with intravenous toripalimab (240 mg) Q3W and oral lenvatinib (8 mg) once daily for one year. The expression of programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) and genetic status was investigated in paraffin-embedded tissues using immunohistochemistry and whole-exome sequencing (WES) analysis. The primary endpoint was the objective response rate (ORR). Secondary outcomes included safety, overall survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS), disease control rate (DCR) and duration of response (DoR). As of July 1, 2022, the median follow-up time was 23.5 months, and the ORR was 80%. Twenty-three patients achieved partial response, and one achieved complete response. Patients (21/30) with DNA damage response (DDR)-related gene mutations showed a higher ORR, while patients (14/30) with tumor area positivity ≥1 (PD-L1 staining) showed a trend of high ORR, but without significant difference. The median OS, PFS, and DoR were 22.5, 10.2, and 11.0 months, respectively. The DCR was 93.3%. Further, 56.7% of patients experienced manageable grade ≥3 adverse events (AEs), commonly neutropenia (40.0%) and leukocytopenia (23.3%).

72,Impact of Transarterial Chemoembolization or Hepatic Artery Infusion Chemotherapy on Liver Function after Hepatocellular Carcinoma Resection: An Observational Study.,Yue R; Liu X,"INTRODUCTION: Liver surgery leads to a high degree of heterogeneity in the prognosis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients. However, most previous studies focused on the postoperative therapeutic effects of other treatments, with relatively few studies on the impacts on liver function. This study investigated the impact of transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) and hepatic artery infusion chemotherapy (HAIC) on liver function after HCC resection from various angles. METHODS: 138 HCC patients were enrolled, including 27 patients who received TACE and 80 patients who received HAIC. Besides routine treatment such as liver protection and antiviral therapy, 31 patients received no other treatment. The different groups were compared with various biological parameters with four types of scoring methods. RESULTS: In the short term after TACE, the mean (±SD) alanine transaminase and aspartate transaminase values increased by 79.22 ± 117.43 U/L and 66.33 ± 94.54 U/L, respectively (p < 0.01). The mean (±SD) total bilirubin (TBIL) values increased by 4.02 ± 6.08 μmol/L (p < 0.01). The mean (±SD) albumin (ALB) values decreased by 3.54 ± 2.93 g/L (p < 0.001). The mean (±SD) albumin bilirubin (ALBI) scores increased by 0.39 ± 0.22 (p < 0.001). In the short term after HAIC, the mean (±SD) TBIL values increased by 2.11 ± 5.57 μmol/L (p < 0.01). The mean (±SD) ALB values decreased by 2.52 ± 3.26 g/L (p < 0.001), and the mean (±SD) ALBI scores increased by 0.21 ± 0.42 (p < 0.001). In both treatment groups, the long-term liver function was not significantly different from that before treatment and also from that of the untreated group (p > 0.05).

73,Machine Learning-Based Development of Nomogram for Hepatocellular Carcinoma to Predict Acute Liver Function Deterioration After Drug-Eluting Beads Transarterial Chemoembolization.,Li J; Zhang Y; Ye H; Hu L; Li X; Li Y; Yu P; Wu B; Lv P; Li Z,"RATIONALE AND OBJECTIVES: Acute liver function deterioration (ALFD) following drug-eluting beads transarterial chemotherapy embolism (DEB-TACE) was considered a risk factor for prognosis in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). In this study, we aimed to develop and validate a nomogram for the prediction of ALFD after DEB-TACE. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 288 patients with HCC from a single center were randomly divided into a training dataset (n = 201) and a validation dataset (n = 87). The univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were performed to determine risk factors for ALFD. The least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) was applied to identify the key risk factors and fit a model. The performance, calibration, and clinical utility of the predictive nomogram were assessed using receiver operating characteristic curves, calibration curves, and decision curve analysis (DCA). RESULTS: LASSO regression analysis determined six risk factors with fibrosis index based on four factors (FIB-4) as the independent factor for the occurrence of ALFD after DEB-TACE. Gamma-glutamyltransferase, FIB-4, tumor extent, and portal vein invasion were integrated into the nomogram. In both the training and validation cohorts, the nomogram demonstrated promising discrimination with AUC of 0.762 and 0.878, respectively. The calibration curves and DCA revealed good calibration and clinical utility of the predictive nomogram. CONCLUSION: The nomogram-based risk of ALFD stratification may improve clinical decision-making and surveillance protocols for patients with a high risk of ALFD after DEB-TACE. Elsevier Inc.

In advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), while extrahepatic lesions demonstrate objective response rates (ORR) of 20%-40%, only 10% of intrahepatic lesions respond. Although first-line atezolizumab/bevacizumab has shown survival benefits in advanced HCC, organ-specific responses remain unexplored. Therefore, we aimed to assess organ-specific responses in patients with advanced HCC receiving atezolizumab/bevacizumab. METHODS: This retrospective, multicenter, observational study included patients who received first-line atezolizumab/bevacizumab for advanced HCC. Patients with Child-Pugh class A, measurable tumour lesions and serial imaging available for response evaluation were eligible. RESULTS: Between May 2020 and June 2021, 131 patients (median age: 62) from three cancer referral institutions were included. Ninety-one had hepatitis B (69.5%), 108 were at Barcelona clinic liver cancer stage C (82.4%), and 78 had extrahepatic metastasis (59.5%). After a median follow-up of 10.1 months, median progression-free survival was 6.8 months (95% confidence interval [CI], 4.6-9.2), median overall survival remained unreached (95% CI, range unavailable) and the ORR was 29.0%. Among 270 individual tumour lesions, the liver was the most commonly involved organ (n = 158). Atezolizumab/bevacizumab induced ORR of 27.8%, 42.2%, 29.1% and 21.0% for liver, lymph nodes, lungs and other sites, respectively. The organ-specific response rate for intrahepatic tumours decreased with increasing size (35.6%: <5 cm, 15.0%: ≥ 5 cm).

METHODS: This is a subanalysis of the SORAMIC trial. Overall, 363 patients were included. The SIRT/Sorafenib treatment group comprised 182 patients and the sorafenib group 181 patients. Myosteatosis was defined as skeletal muscle density (SMD) < 41 HU for patients with a body mass index up to 24.9 kg/m(2) and <33 HU for patients with a body mass index ≥25 kg/m(2). Albumin-gauge score was calculated as follows: serum albumin (g/dL) × SMD (HU). To assess the impact of muscle quality on clinical variables and OS, a Cox regression model was used. Hazard ratios are presented together with 95 % confidence intervals (95 % CI). Kaplan-Meier curves were used for survival analysis. RESULTS: In the SIRT/sorafenib cohort, low albumin-gauge score was an independent predictor of worse OS, HR = 1.74, CI 95% (1.16-2.62), p = 0.01. In the sorafenib cohort, muscle quality parameters did not predict OS. In alcohol-induced HCC (n = 129), myosteatosis independently predicted OS, HR = 1.85, CI 95% (1.10; 3.12), p = 0.02. In viral-induced HCC (n = 99), parameters of muscle quality did not predict OS. In patients with NASH/Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) induced HCC, albumin-gauge score was a strong independent predictor of worse OS in the subgroup undergoing combined treatment with SIRT and sorafenib, HR = 9.86, CI 95% (1.12; 86.5), p = 0.04. CONCLUSIONS: Myosteatosis predicts independently worse OS in patients with alcohol-induced HCC undergoing combined treatment with SIRT and sorafenib. In patients with NASH/NAFLD induced HCC undergoing treatment with SIRT and sorafenib, albumin-gauge score predicts independently worse OS. IMPACT AND IMPLICATIONS: Associations between parameters of muscle quality and OS are different in accordance to the treatment strategy and etiology of HCC.

OBJECTIVE: To compare the efficacy and safety of sorafenib plus transarterial chemoembolization vs sorafenib alone as postoperative adjuvant therapy for patients with hepatocellular carcinoma with portal vein tumor thrombus. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This was a phase 3, multicenter, randomized clinical trial conducted in 5 hospitals in China. A total of 158 patients were enrolled and randomized from October 2019 to March 2022, with a median follow-up of 28.4 months. Portal vein tumor thrombus was graded by the Cheng classification. Eligible patients with hepatocellular carcinoma with Cheng grade I to III portal vein tumor thrombus (ie, involving segmental or sectoral branches, right- or left-side branch, or main trunk of portal vein) were included. INTERVENTIONS: Patients were randomly assigned 1:1 to receive transarterial chemoembolization with sorafenib or sorafenib alone as postoperative adjuvant therapy. Sorafenib treatment was started within 3 days after randomization, with an initial dose of 400 mg orally twice a day. In the transarterial chemoembolization with sorafenib group, transarterial chemoembolization was performed 1 day after the first administration of sorafenib. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary end point was recurrence-free survival. Efficacy was assessed in the intention-to-treat population and safety was assessed in patients who received at least 1 dose of study treatment. RESULTS: Of 158 patients included, the median (IQR) age was 54 (43-61) years, and 140 (88.6%) patients were male. The median (IQR) recurrence-free survival was significantly longer in the transarterial chemoembolization with sorafenib group (16.8 [12.0-NA] vs 12.6 [7.8-18.1] months; hazard ratio [HR], 0.57; 95% CI, 0.39-0.83; P = .002). The median (IQR) overall survival was also significantly longer with transarterial chemoembolization with sorafenib than with sorafenib alone (30.4 [20.6-NA] vs 22.5 [15.4-NA] months; HR, 0.57; 95% CI, 0.36-0.91; P = .02). The most common grade 3/4 adverse event was hand-foot syndrome (23 of 79 patients in the transarterial chemoembolization with sorafenib group [29.1%] vs 24 of 79 patients in the sorafenib alone group [30.4%]). There were no treatment-related deaths in either group. The transarterial chemoembolization with sorafenib group did not show additional toxicity compared with the sorafenib monotherapy group. CONCLUSION AND RELEVANCE: In this study, the combination of sorafenib and transarterial chemoembolization as postoperative adjuvant therapy in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma with portal vein tumor thrombus resulted in longer recurrence-free survival and overall survival than sorafenib alone and was well tolerated.

We aimed to investigate the effectiveness of low-contrast-dose CT using dual-energy CT and deep learning-based denoising (DLD) techniques in patients at high risk of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). METHODS: We performed a prospective, randomized controlled noninferiority trial at a tertiary hospital between June 2019 and August 2020 (NCT04027556). Patients at high risk of HCC were randomly assigned (1:1) to the standard-contrast-dose group or low-contrast-dose group, which targeted a 40% reduction in contrast medium dose based on lean body weight. HCC conspicuity on arterial phase images was the primary endpoint with a noninferiority margin of 0.2. Images were independently assessed by three radiologists; model-based iterative reconstruction (MBIR) images of the standard-contrast-dose group and low monoenergetic (50-keV) DLD images of the low-contrast-dose group were compared using a generalized estimating equation. RESULTS: Ninety participants (age 59 ± 10 years; 68 men) were analyzed. Compared with the standard-contrast-dose group (n = 47), 40% less contrast media was used in the low-contrast-dose group (n = 43) (107.0 ± 17.1 mL vs. 64.5 ± 11.3 mL, p < 0.001). In the arterial phase, HCC conspicuity on 50-keV DLD images in the low-contrast-dose group was noninferior to that of MBIR images in the standard-contrast-dose group (2.92 vs. 2.56; difference, 0.36; 95% confidence interval, -0.13 to ∞; p = 0.013). CONCLUSIONS: The contrast dose in liver CT can be reduced by 40% without impairing HCC conspicuity when using 50-keV and DLD techniques.

METHODS: Participants were recruited and underwent four-phase dynamic CT (NCT04722120). They were randomly assigned to either standard-dose (SD) or DLD protocol. All CT images were initially reconstructed using iterative reconstruction, and the images of the DLD protocol were further processed using the DL-CB algorithm (DLD-DL). The primary endpoint was the contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR), the secondary endpoint was qualitative image quality (noise, hepatic lesion, and vessel conspicuity), and the tertiary endpoint was lesion detection rate. The t-test or repeated measures analysis of variance was used for analysis. RESULTS: Sixty-eight participants with 57 focal liver lesions were enrolled (20 with HCC and 37 with benign findings). The DLD protocol had a 19.8% lower radiation dose (DLP, 855.1 ± 254.8 mGy·cm vs. 713.3 ± 94.6 mGy·cm, p = .003) and 27% lower contrast dose (106.9 ± 15.0 mL vs. 77.9 ± 9.4 mL, p < .001) than the SD protocol. The comparative analysis demonstrated that CNR (p < .001) and portal vein conspicuity (p = .002) were significantly higher in the DLD-DL than in the SD protocol. There was no significant difference in lesion detection rate for all lesions (82.7% vs. 73.3%, p = .140) and HCCs (75.7% vs. 70.4%, p = .644) between the SD protocol and DLD-DL.

METHODS: Patients were randomly allocated to the CBATO-TACE group and the conventional transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (cTACE) group. The primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS). The secondary endpoint was overall survival (OS), treatment response, and treatment-related adverse events (TRAEs). The extrahepatic collateral arteries, liver function, and liver fibrosis after the first TACE were also evaluated. RESULTS: From September 2018 to September 2020, a total of 207 patients who underwent TACE were consecutively enrolled in this study. The median PFS was 9.5 months (range: 8.0 - 11.0) in the CBATO group, which was significantly longer than that in the cTACE group (6.0 months, range: 4.0-6.0) (p < 0.0001). Patients in the CBATO group had a median OS of 22 months (range: 20.0 - 27.0) compared with 16 months (range: 15.0 - 20.0) in the cTACE group (p = 0.0084). The most common TRAEs were fever (p = 0.043), and nausea and vomiting (p = 0.002), which were more observed in the cTACE group. In addition, the progressive disease time, pulmonary metastasis rate (p = 0.01), the mean number of extrahepatic collateral arteries (p = 0.01), and average number of TACE sessions (p = 0.025) were significantly decreased in the CBATO group. CONCLUSIONS: CBATO-TACE achieved better therapeutic outcomes and similar safety profile compared to cTACE in large or huge HCC patients. Furthermore, CBATO-TACE was able to reduce extrahepatic collateral arteries production and extrahepatic lung metastasis. CLINICAL RELEVANCE STATEMENT: Our study showed that CalliSpheres® beads loaded with arsenic trioxide (CBATO-TACE) were effective and safe for the treatment of large and giant HCC. In addition, CBATO-TACE can reduce lateral hepatic branch artery formation and extrahepatic pulmonary metastasis, which provides a new treatment approach for unresectable HCC.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this prospective, observational study, 262 adult participants with HCC were divided into TACE+ (n = 93, 35%) or T-N (n = 169, 65%) groups, included from 36 centers in the United States. Overall survival (OS) was assessed using Kaplan-Meier analysis from the date of TARE. Best response at 6 months was evaluated using modified Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors. Six-month toxicities were reported using Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, version 5. RESULTS: Median OS for patients in the TACE+ and T-N groups was 22.3 months (95% CI: 17.2 to not reachable) and 21.5 months (95% confidence interval [CI]: 14.9-29.9), respectively (P = .6). Imaging at 6 months ± 2 weeks was available in 156 of 262 (60%) participants.

83,Anti-hepatitis C antibody carriage and risk of liver impairment in rural-Cameroon: adapting the control of hepatocellular carcinoma for resource-limited settings.,Kamga Wouambo R; Panka Tchinda G; Kagoue Simeni LA; Djouela Djoulako PD; Yateu Wouambo CI; Tamko Mella GF; Tchoumi Leuwat EP; Bello D; Fokam J,"BACKGROUND: The Viral hepatitis elimination by 2030 is uncertain in resource-limited settings (RLS), due to high burdens and poor diagnostic coverage. This sounds more challenging for hepatitis C virus (HCV) given that antibody (HCVAb) sero-positivity still lacks wide access to HCV RNA molecular testing. This warrants context-specific strategies for appropriate management of liver impairment in RLS. We herein determine the association between anti-HCV positivity and liver impairment in an African RLS. METHODS: A facility-based observational study was conducted from July-August 2021 among individuals attending the ""St Monique"" Health Center at Ottou, a rural community of Yaounde,Cameroon. Following a consecutive sampling, consenting individuals were tested for anti-HCV antibodies, hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) and HIV antibodies (HIVAb) as per the national guidelines. After excluding positive cases for HBsAg and/or HIVAb, liver function tests (ALT/AST) were performed on eligible participants (HBsAg and HIVAb negative) and outcomes were compared according to HCVAb status; with p < 0.05 considered statistically significant. RESULTS: Out of 306 eligible participants (negative for HBsAg and HIVAb) enrolled, the mean age was 34.35 ± 3.67 years. 252(82.35%) were female and 129 (42.17%) were single. The overall HCVAb sero-positivity was 15.68%(48/306), with 17.86% (45/252) among women vs. 5.55%(3/54) among men [OR (95%CI) = 3.69(2.11-9.29),p = 0.04]. HCVAb Carriage was greater among participants aged > 50 years compared to younger ones [38.46%(15/39) versus 12.36% (33/267) respectively, OR(95%CI) = 4.43(2.11-9.29), p < 0.000] and in multipartnership [26.67%(12/45)vs.13.79%(36/261) monopartnership, OR (95%CI) = 2.27(1.07-4.80),p = 0.03]. The liver impairment rate (abnormal ALT+AST levels) was 30.39%(93/306), with 40.19%(123/306) of abnormal ALT alone. Moreover, the burden of Liver impairment was significantly with aged> 50 versus younger ones [69.23% (27/39) versus 24.72%(66/267) respectively, p < 0.000). Interestingly, the burden of liver impairment (abnormal AST + ALAT) was significantly higher in HCVAb positive (62.5%, 30/48) versus HCVAb negative (24.42%, 63/258) participants, OR: 3.90 [1.96; 7.79], p = 0.0001. CONCLUSIONS: In this rural health facility, HCVAb is highly endemic and the burden of liver impairment is concerning. Interestingly, HCVAb carriage is associated with abnormal liver levels of enzyme (ALT/AST), especially among the elderly populations. Hence, in the absence of nuclei acid testing, ALT/AST are relevant sentinel markers to screen HCVAb carriers who require monitoring/care for HCV-associated hepatocellular carcinoma in RLS.",False,Population and study design do not match the target criteria.,individuals attending a health center in Cameroon,not specified,not specified,association between anti-HCV positivity and liver impairment,facility-based observational study,False,The population and study design do not match the target criteria.

We aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of sintilimab plus bevacizumab combined with radiotherapy in HCC with PVTT and to identify prognostic biomarkers. APPROACH AND RESULTS: This open-label, multicenter, single-arm, phase 2 clinical trial was conducted at 3 tertiary hospitals in China. A total of 46 patients with HCC with PVTT were enrolled. All the patients received the first cycle of i.v. sintilimab (200 mg, day 1) plus bevacizumab (15 mg/kg, day 1) within 3 days after enrollment. Radiotherapy (30-50 Gy/10 fractions) was administered after 2 cycles of Sin-Bev. Sin-Bev was disrupted during radiotherapy and resumed 2 weeks after radiotherapy and continued every 3 weeks thereafter until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or withdrawal of consent. The primary end point was objective response rate. Patients obtained an objective response rate of 58.7% and a disease control rate of 100%. After a median follow-up time of 26.0 months (95% CI: 24.0-26.0), the median OS was 24.0 months (95% CI: 19.0 to not applicable) and the median progression-free survival was 13.8 months (95% CI: 12.0-21.0), respectively. No unexpected adverse events or treatment-related deaths occurred. Mutations of PCTMD1 were predictive of shorter OS and progression-free survival.

Targeting membranous phosphatidylserine may induce pro-inflammatory and -immune stimulating effects that enhance immunotherapy activity. This hypothesis was tested in a single-arm phase 2 trial evaluating frontline bavituximab, a phosphatidylserine targeting antibody, plus pembrolizumab (anti-PD-1) in patients with unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (NCT03519997). The primary endpoint was investigator-assessed objective response rate among evaluable patients, and secondary end points included progression-free survival, incidence of adverse events, overall survival, and duration of response. Among 28 evaluable patients, the confirmed response rate was 32.1%, which met the pre-specified endpoint, and the median progression-free survival was 6.3 months (95% CI, 1.3-11.3 months). Treatment related-adverse events of any grade occurred in 45.7% of patients, with grade 3 or greater adverse events in 14.3% of patients. Adverse events of any cause were observed in 33 patients (94.3%), with grade 3 or greater adverse events in 11 patients (31.4%). Prespecified exploratory analyses of baseline tumor specimens showed that a depletion of B cells, and the presence of fibrotic tissue and expression of immune checkpoints in stroma was associated with tumor response.

This study investigated the role of MYCN as a predictive biomarker for therapeutic response to ACR and prognosis of HCC. MYCN gene expression in HCC was analyzed in the Cancer Genome Atlas and a Taiwanese cohort (N = 118). Serum MYCN protein levels were assessed in healthy controls (N = 15), patients with HCC (N = 116), pre- and post-surgical patients with HCC (N = 20), and a subset of patients from a phase 3 clinical trial of ACR (N = 68, NCT01640808). The results showed increased MYCN gene expression in HCC tumors, which positively correlated with HCC recurrence in non-cirrhotic or single-tumor patients. Serum MYCN protein levels were higher in patients with HCC, decreased after surgical resection of HCC, and were associated with liver functional reserve and fibrosis markers, as well as long-term HCC prognosis (>4 years). Subgroup analysis of a phase 3 clinical trial of ACR identified serum MYCN as the risk factor most strongly associated with HCC recurrence. Patients with HCC with higher serum MYCN levels after a 4-week treatment of ACR exhibited a significantly higher risk of recurrence (hazard ratio 3.27; p = .022). In conclusion, serum MYCN holds promise for biomarker-based precision medicine for the prevention of HCC, long-term prognosis of early-stage HCC, and identification of high-response subgroups for ACR-based treatment.

APPROACH AND RESULTS: We fielded surveys measuring psychological harms to patients with cirrhosis in a multicenter randomized trial of HCC surveillance outreach. All patients with positive or indeterminate surveillance results and matched patients with negative results were invited to complete surveys measuring (1) depression through the Patient Health Questionnaire-ninth version, (2) anxiety through State-Trait Anxiety Inventory, (3) HCC-specific worry through Psychological Consequences Questionnaire, and (4) decisional regret. Patients were classified into 4 groups: true positive (TP), false positive (FP), indeterminate, and true negative (TN). Multivariable longitudinal regression analysis using the generalized estimating equation method was performed to compare the means of measures across groups.

Hypothermic oxygenated machine perfusion (HMP-O 2 ) has shown benefits compared to static cold storage (SCS) by limiting ischemia-reperfusion injury. This study reports outcomes using a novel portable HMP-O 2 device in the first US randomized control trial. APPROACH AND RESULTS: The PILOT trial (NCT03484455) was a multicenter, randomized, open-label, noninferiority trial, with participants randomized to HMP-O 2 or SCS. HMP-O 2 livers were preserved using the Lifeport Liver Transporter and Vasosol perfusion solution. The primary outcome was early allograft dysfunction. Noninferiority margin was 7.5%. From April 3, 2019, to July 12, 2022, 179 patients were randomized to HMP-O 2 (n=90) or SCS (n=89). The per-protocol cohort included 63 HMP-O 2 and 73 SCS. Early allograft dysfunction occurred in 11.1% HMP-O 2 (N=7) and 16.4% SCS (N=12). The risk difference between HMP-O 2 and SCS was -5.33% (one-sided 95% upper confidence limit of 5.81%), establishing noninferiority. The risk of graft failure as predicted by Liver Graft Assessment Following Transplant score at seven days (L-GrAFT 7 ) was lower with HMP-O 2 [median (IQR) 3.4% (2.4-6.5) vs. 4.5% (2.9-9.4), p =0.024]. Primary nonfunction occurred in 2.2% of all SCS (n=3, p =0.10). Biliary strictures occurred in 16.4% SCS (n=12) and 6.3% (n=4) HMP-O 2 ( p =0.18). Nonanastomotic biliary strictures occurred only in SCS (n=4). CONCLUSIONS: HMP-O 2 demonstrates safety and noninferior efficacy for liver graft preservation in comparison to SCS.

However, limited evidence exists regarding its use in oligometastatic hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). We aimed to prospectively investigate the efficacy and safety of SABR in patients with oligometastatic HCC. METHODS: We enrolled patients with controlled primary HCC and one to five metastatic lesions amenable to SABR. The primary endpoint was treatment efficacy defined as overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS). The secondary endpoints included time to local progression, objective response rate, disease control rate, toxicities, and quality of life (QOL), assessed using the EORTC QLQ-C30 before, and 0, 1, and 3 months after SABR. RESULTS: Overall, 40 consecutive patients received SABR on 62 lesions between 2021 and 2022. The most common locations for OMD were the lungs (48.4%), lymph nodes (22.6%), and bone (17.7%). After a median follow-up of 15.5 months, the 2-year OS was 80%. Median PFS was 5.3 months, with 1- and 2-year PFS rates of 21.2% and 0%, respectively. A shorter time to OMD from the controlled primary independently correlated with PFS (p = 0.039, hazard ratio 2.127) alongside age, Child-Pugh class, and alpha-fetoprotein (p = 0.002, 0.004, 0.019, respectively). The 2-year time to local progression, objective response rate, and disease control rate were 91.1%, 75.8%, and 98.4%, respectively. Overall, 10% of patients experienced acute toxicity, and 7.5% experienced late toxicity, with no grade 3+ toxicity. All QOL scores remained stable, whereas the patients without systemic treatments had improved insomnia and social functioning scores. CONCLUSIONS: SABR is an effective and feasible option for oligometastatic HCC that leads to excellent local tumor control and improves survival without adversely affecting QOL. IMPACT AND IMPLICATIONS: Stereotactic ablative radiotherapy (SABR) is a non-invasive treatment approach capable of efficiently ablating the target lesion; however, neither the oligometastatic disease concept nor the potential benefits of SABR have been well-defined in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). According to this study, SABR is an effective and safe treatment option for oligometastatic HCC, yielding excellent local tumor control and survival improvement without worsening patients' quality of life, regardless of tumor sites. We also demonstrated that patients with a later presentation of OMD from the controlled primary and lower alpha-fetoprotein levels achieved better survival outcomes.

However, tumor recurrence occurs in 15-20% of cases with unfavorable prognosis. We have developed a library of T cell receptors (TCRs) specific for different hepatitis B virus (HBV) antigens, restricted by different molecules of human leucocyte antigen (HLA)-class I, to redirect T cells against HBV antigens (Banu in Sci Rep 4:4166, 2014). We further demonstrated that these transiently functional T cells specific for HBV obtained through messenger RNA (mRNA) electroporation can eliminate HCC cells expressing HBV antigens in vitro and in vivo (Kah in J Clin Invest 127:3177-3188, 2017). A phase I clinical trial for patients with HCC recurrence post-liver transplant was conducted to assess the safety, tolerability, and anti-tumor efficacy of transiently functional HBV-TCR T cells. Here, we report the clinical findings with regard to the safety and anti-tumor efficacy of mRNA electroporated HBV-specific TCR-T cells. (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT02719782).

The primary objective was to assess the safety of short-lived mRNA electroporated HBV-TCR T cells based on the incidence and severity of the adverse event (AE) graded per National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI CTCAE), Version 4.0. The secondary objective was to determine the effectiveness of HBV-TCR T cells as per RECIST 1.1 criteria. Patients were followed up for survival for 2 years post-end of treatment. RESULTS: The median age of the six patients was 35.5 years (range: 28-47). The median number of HBV-TCR T cell infusions administered was 6.5 (range: 4-12). The treatment-related AE included grade 1 pyrexia. This study reported no cytokine release syndrome nor neurotoxicity.

After excluding cases who died within 30 days of surgery, the estimated median overall survival (OS) was 43.8 months in the AD (+) group and 47.4 months in the AD (-) group (P = 0.367). The median liver-specific survival and disease-free survival (DFS) were also comparable between the two groups. After Cox regression multivariate analysis, the presence of AD did not lead to a higher risk of all-cause mortality, liver-specific mortality, or disease recurrence. CONCLUSION: Our study demonstrated that autoimmune disease does not impair the OS and DFS of HCC patients undergoing liver resections. AD itself is not a risk factor for tumor recurrence after surgery. Patients eligible for liver resections, as a result, should be considered for surgery irrespective of the presence of AD.

We evaluated whether MPC inhibitors (MPCi) might correct impairments in branched chain amino acid (BCAA) catabolism, which are predictive of developing diabetes and NASH. METHODS: Circulating BCAA concentrations were measured in people with NASH and type 2 diabetes, who participated in a recent randomized, placebo-controlled Phase IIB clinical trial to test the efficacy and safety of the MPCi MSDC-0602K (EMMINENCE; NCT02784444). In this 52-week trial, patients were randomly assigned to placebo (n = 94) or 250 mg MSDC-0602K (n = 101). Human hepatoma cell lines and mouse primary hepatocytes were used to test the direct effects of various MPCi on BCAA catabolism in vitro. Lastly, we investigated how hepatocyte-specific deletion of MPC2 affects BCAA metabolism in the liver of obese mice and MSDC-0602K treatment of Zucker diabetic fatty (ZDF) rats. RESULTS: In patients with NASH, MSDC-0602K treatment, which led to marked improvements in insulin sensitivity and diabetes, had decreased plasma concentrations of BCAAs compared to baseline while placebo had no effect. The rate-limiting enzyme in BCAA catabolism is the mitochondrial branched chain ketoacid dehydrogenase (BCKDH), which is deactivated by phosphorylation. In multiple human hepatoma cell lines, MPCi markedly reduced BCKDH phosphorylation and stimulated branched chain keto acid catabolism; an effect that required the BCKDH phosphatase PPM1K. Mechanistically, the effects of MPCi were linked to activation of the energy sensing AMP-dependent protein kinase (AMPK) and mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) kinase signaling cascades in vitro. BCKDH phosphorylation was reduced in liver of obese, hepatocyte-specific MPC2 knockout (LS-Mpc2-/-) mice compared to wild-type controls concomitant with activation of mTOR signaling in vivo. Finally, while MSDC-0602K treatment improved glucose homeostasis and increased the concentrations of some BCAA metabolites in ZDF rats, it did not lower plasma BCAA concentrations. CONCLUSIONS: These data demonstrate novel cross talk between mitochondrial pyruvate and BCAA metabolism and suggest that MPC inhibition leads to lower plasma BCAA concentrations and BCKDH phosphorylation by activating the mTOR axis. However, the effects of MPCi on glucose homeostasis may be separable from its effects on BCAA concentrations.",False,"Population does not match, and outcomes are not related to survival or response rate in hepatocellular carcinoma.",people with NASH and type 2 diabetes,MPC inhibitor MSDC-0602K,placebo,"BCAA concentrations, BCKDH phosphorylation","randomized, placebo-controlled Phase IIB clinical trial",False,Population does not match as it focuses on NASH and type 2 diabetes.

This phase II trial was conducted to prospectively investigate the efficacy and safety of lenvatinib, sintilimab (a PD-1 inhibitor) plus TACE (Len-Sin-TACE) in patients with advanced stage HCC. METHODS: This was a single-arm phase II trial. Patients with BCLC stage C HCC were recruited. They received lenvatinib (bodyweight ≥60 kg, 12 mg; bodyweight <60 kg, 8 mg) orally once daily, sintilimab (200 mg) intravenously once every 3 weeks, and on demand TACE. The primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS) per mRECIST. RESULTS: Thirty patients were enrolled. The primary endpoint was met with a median PFS of 8.0 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 6.1-9.8) months per mRECIST, which was the same as that per RECIST 1.1. The objective response rate was 60.0% per mRECIST and 30.0% per RECIST 1.1. The disease control rate was 86.7% per mRECIST/RECIST 1.1.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: It is an observational retrospective study done between May 2020 and September 2021. The data were collected from 35 patients of advanced HCC who underwent SBRT. Patients of Child Pugh status (CPs) A5-B7 and with a liver reserve of ≥ 700cc were included. Local control (LC), overall survival (OS) and adverse events including decompensation were carefully recorded. RESULTS: In the cohort, Portal vein and IVC tumor thrombosis were present in 33 (94.3%) and 8 (22.85%) patients, respectively. Lung and nodal metastasis were found in 11 (31.4%) and 21 (60%) of patients, respectively. The median gross tumor volume (GTV) was 563cc (range 80-1925cc). The median SBRT dose prescription was 35 Gy (range 25-40 Gy) in 5-10 fractions. Post radiation therapy, there was improvement in pain and discomfort in 24 out of 29 (82.75%) and 18 out of 23 (78%) patients respectively. Also bone metastasis related pain was improved in all 3 (100%) patients. One year LC, and OS were 80% and 30% respectively. On multivariate analysis, the GTV volume > 750cc and PIVKA-II > 8000 mAU/ml remained the predictor factor for poor OS. Post SBRT, change in child-pugh score by 1 point was observed in 7 patients (20%) which was managed conservatively. CONCLUSION: SBRT is a safe and feasible option for BCLC‑C HCC. It not only improves the quality of life by symptom control but also results in good LC and OS with acceptable toxicity.

Theoretically, a combination of tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) with ICIs may restore immunotherapy sensitivity. METHODS: In this phase 1b study, patients received AL2846, an antiangiogenic TKI with multiple targets (c-MET, VEGFR1, c-KIT, Axl, RET, KDR, and VEGFR3), in combination with an anti-PD-L1 antibody (TQB2450) until disease progression, intolerable toxicity, death, or discontinuation for any cause. The primary end points included overall response rate (ORR) and safety, with secondary end points encompassing progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), disease control rate (DCR), and duration of response. RESULTS: Between November 2021 and September 2022, 18 patients with ESCC and 15 patients with HCC, whose ORR was 11.1% (95% confidence interval [CI], 3.1%-32.8%) and 0%, respectively, were enrolled. Adverse events (AEs) of any grade and treatment-related AEs were documented in 32 patients (97.0%) and 31 patients (93.9%), respectively. Grade 3 or higher AEs were observed in 10 patients (30.3%), with vomiting (6.1%) and infectious pneumonia (9.1%) being the most prevalent. Median PFS and OS values were 3.22 months (95% CI, 1.35-5.68 months) and 5.98 months (95% CI, 3.71-8.87 months), respectively, in patients with ESCC, and 5.55 months (95% CI, 2.66 months to not evaluable [NE]) and 16.72 months (95% CI, 4.86 months to NE), respectively, in patients with HCC. The DCRs were 66.7% (95% CI, 43.75%-83.72%) in patients with ESCC and 73.3% (95% CI, 48.05%-89.10%) in patients with HCC.

98,Liver Transplantation vs Partial Hepatectomy for Stage T2 Multifocal Hepatocellular Carcinoma <3 cm Without Vascular Invasion: A Propensity Score-Matched Survival Analysis.,Wong LL; Landsittel DP; Kwee SA,"BACKGROUND: Multifocal hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) differs biologically and immunologically from single-nodule HCC. Asian and European guidelines consider liver transplantation (LT) and partial hepatectomy (PH) as effective for T2 multifocal HCC, with preference toward LT, but few US studies compare these treatments directly. This propensity score-based observational study uses an established national cancer outcomes registry to compare overall survival in patients undergoing PH and LT for multifocal HCC. STUDY DESIGN: Data from the 2020 National Cancer Database were obtained on patients who underwent LT or PH for multifocal stage 2 HCC within Milan criteria and without vascular invasion. Propensity score matching and Cox regression analysis was applied to evaluate overall survival in an observational cohort balanced by age, sex, treatment facility type, treatment year, prothrombin time, α-fetoprotein, comorbidity burden, liver fibrosis severity, and pretreatment creatinine and bilirubin levels. RESULTS: Of 21,248 T2 HCC patients identified, 6,744 had multifocal tumors with largest tumor diameter <3 cm without major vascular invasion, with 1,267 and 181 having undergone LT and PH, respectively. Propensity score-matched Cox regression analysis associated LT with a hazard ratio of 0.39 (95% CI 0.30 to 0.50) relative to PH. Landmark analyses to account for a longer interval to LT demonstrated survival benefits of similar magnitude. CONCLUSIONS: Although early-stage HCC can be effectively treated with either LT or PH, propensity score-matched analysis comparatively shows a survival benefit for LT in patients with multifocal HCC who are within the Milan criteria.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Fifty-four patients with untreated advanced HCC who could not be resected were randomly divided into the ANL group (n = 27) and ANL+S-1 group (n = 27). The ANL group was given 10 mg ANL orally once a day for 14 consecutive days, stopped for 1 week, and repeated every 21 days. The ANL+S-1 group was given 10 mg ANL once a day orally and 40 mg S-1 twice a day orally for 14 consecutive days, stopped for 1 week, repeated every 21 days. All patients were treated until the disease progressed or toxicity became unacceptable. For patients who could not tolerate adverse reactions, the ANL dose should be reduced to 8 mg per day. CT or MRI was reviewed every 6 weeks to evaluate the efficacy. RESULTS: A total of 44 patients were included in the results analysis, including 22 patients in the ANL group and 22 patients in the ANL+S-1 group. In the ANL group, the objective response rate (ORR) was 4.5% (1/22), the disease control rate (DCR) was 77.3% (17/22), the median progression-free survival (PFS) was 4.2 months (95% CI: 3.6-6.0) and the median overall survival (mOS) was 7.0 months (95% CI: 6.3-9.0).

100,Effectiveness of a nurse-led decision counselling programme on hepatocellular carcinoma screening uptake among patients with hepatitis B: A randomised controlled trial.,Li C; Lu X; Xu J; Gao F; Lee E; Chan CWH,"BACKGROUND: The globally endemic hepatocellular carcinoma induced by hepatitis B highlights the need for an ultrasonography-based screening strategy to reduce the tumour burden. However, patient non-adherence due to unawareness and complex decisions in weighting uncertainties of hepatocellular carcinoma screening has continuously challenged its continuum. OBJECTIVE: To examine the effectiveness and process of a nurse-led decision counselling programme for improving hepatocellular carcinoma screening among patients with hepatitis B. DESIGN: Single-blind randomised controlled trial. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: Between 12 March and 19 July 2021, 178 patients with hepatitis B were recruited from six inpatient wards of a university-affiliated hospital in northern China. METHODS: Participants were randomly allocated to receive usual care (n = 89) or usual care plus a nurse-led decision counselling programme (n = 89). Underpinned by the preventive health model, the programme consisted of health education, tailored information, and values clarification exercises to elicit informed and value-based preferences for hepatocellular carcinoma screening. Screening barriers were explored and addressed through procedural problem-solving. Hepatocellular carcinoma screening rate at six months post-baseline was the primary outcome. Secondary outcomes (knowledge, perceptions, and decision conflicts regarding hepatocellular carcinoma screening) were measured at baseline (T0), immediately after the intervention (T1), and the six-month follow-up (T2). A Medical Research Council framework-guided process evaluation was conducted by drawing on data from intervention documentation, WeChat discussions, and interviews with stakeholders (n = 13). RESULTS: With a mean age of 47.32 (8.78) years, participants mostly occupied rural residences (63.5 %). Compared with the control group, the intervention group had significantly higher hepatocellular carcinoma screening rates (75.6 % vs. 42.1 %, p < 0.001) and displayed greater improvements in the scores of hepatocellular carcinoma screening knowledge (β = 3.643, 95 % confidence interval [CI] = 3.030, 4.255), salience and coherence (β = 0.410, 95 % CI = 0.234, 0.586), response efficacy (β = 0.327, 95 % CI = 0.181, 0.473), and perceived susceptibility (β = 0.214, 95 % CI = 0.040, 0.388) at T1. Improvement in perceived susceptibility was not maintained, whereas a higher decrease of the decision conflict score was found at T2 (β = -4.156, 95 % CI = -7.851, -0.461). The process evaluation revealed potential intervention mechanisms and contextual factors affecting intervention effectiveness, such as living status and natural disasters. CONCLUSION: The programme was effective in improving hepatocellular carcinoma screening and showed that nurses could play a decision counselling role in optimising the screening among patients with hepatitis B.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Fostrox monotherapy was administered in an open-label, single-arm, first-in-human, phase 1a/1b study, in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma, or solid tumor liver metastases. The first part (1a) consisted of intra/inter-patient escalating doses (3 mg to 70 mg) QD for up to 5 days, and the second part (1b), doses of 40 mg QD for 5 days, in 21-day cycles. Safety and tolerability were evaluated by the Safety Review Committee, and efficacy was assessed every 6 weeks with CT or MRI using RECIST 1.1 and mRECIST. RESULTS: Nineteen patients were treated with fostrox. Most common adverse events (AEs) were hematological and increased AST. Grade 3 treatment related AEs (TRAE) were seen in 53% of the patients, with transient neutropenia and thrombocytopenia as the most common. No grade 5 AE was observed. Recommended Phase 2 dose of fostrox was 40 mg QD for 5 days in 21-day cycles. Preliminary efficacy showed a clinical benefit rate in the liver of 53% and stable disease (SD) as best response in 10 patients. Liver targeting with fostrox was confirmed with higher exposure of troxacitabine and its metabolites in liver compared to plasma. Systemic exposure of fostrox was generally low with troxacitabine as main analyte. Biopsies demonstrated tumor-selective, drug-induced DNA damage. CONCLUSION: The phase 1a/1b monotherapy study of fostrox, in patients with liver tumors, showed a tumor selective effect in the liver and that 40 mg QD for 5 days in 21-day cycles is safe and tolerable.

We used large-scale, population-based, observational data to emulate a target trial with two groups, statin user and statin non-user. METHODS: Among 1,379,708 nonunique individuals from the Korean National Health Insurance Service data, 2,915 CHB patients with serum cholesterol level of 200 mg/dL or higher who started statin therapy and 8,525 propensity-score matched CHB patients with serum cholesterol level of 200 mg/dL or higher who did not start statin therapy were analyzed for the development of HCC. In addition, liver cancer or liver-related mortality and all-cause mortality were assessed. RESULTS: During follow-up, 207 participants developed HCC. Incidence rate of HCC was 0.2 per 1,000 person-years in the statin user group and 0.3 per 1,000 person-years in the statin non-user group. Fully adjusted hazard ratio (HR) for incident HCC comparing statin user group to statin nonuser group was 0.56 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.39 to 0.80). The association between statin use and decreased HCC risk was consistent in all subgroups analyzed. Fully adjusted HR comparing statin user to statin nonuser was 0.59 (95% CI: 0.35 to 0.99) for liver cancer or liver-related mortality and 0.93 (95% CI: 0.78 to 1.11) for all-cause mortality.

This trial evaluated the effectiveness and safety of DEB-TACE using small-size (≤ 100 μm) microspheres loaded with epirubicin. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This prospective, single-arm, multicenter study enrolled patients diagnosed with HCC who underwent DEB-TACE using 40 (range, 30-50), 75 (range, 60-90), or 100 (range, 75-125) μm epirubicin-loaded microspheres (TANDEM microspheres, Varian Medical). Bead size was at the discretion of treating physicians and based on tumor size and/or vascular structure. The primary outcome measure was 6-month objective response rate (ORR). Secondary outcome measures were 30-day and 3-month ORR, time to tumor progression and extrahepatic spread, proportion of progression-free survival and overall survival (OS) at one year, and incidence of treatment-associated adverse events. RESULTS: Data from 108 patients from ten centers was analyzed. Six-month ORR was 73.3 and 71.3% based on European association for the study of the liver (EASL) and modified response evaluation criteria in solid tumors (mRECIST) criteria, respectively. Thirty-day ORR was 79.6% for both EASL and mRECIST criteria with 3-month ORR being 80.0 and 81.0%, respectively, for each criteria. One-year PPF and OS rate were 60.3 and 94.3%. There was a total of 30 SAEs reported to be likely to definitely associated with microsphere (n = 9), epirubicin (n = 9), or procedure (n = 12) with none resulting in death.

The synergistic effect of systemic therapy and radiation therapy (RT) might resolve this problem. We aimed to investigate the effect of RT on the treatment outcomes of ICIs and antiangiogenic combination therapy in patients with advanced-stage HCC. METHODS AND MATERIALS: This retrospective observational study analyzed the medical records of 194 patients with Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer stage C HCC who were admitted to our center from August 2018 to June 2022 and received ICIs combined with antiangiogenic therapy as the first-line treatment. Patients who were administered RT for tumor thrombus or symptomatic metastases within 8 weeks of the commencement of combination therapy were allocated to the RT group, whereas those who did not receive RT were assigned to the non-radiation therapy (NRT) group. Propensity score matching was used to mitigate selection bias. The primary endpoints were progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS). The secondary endpoints included objective response rate, disease control rate (DCR), local PFS, out-of-field PFS, and treatment-related adverse events. RESULTS: A total of 76 patients diagnosed with advanced-stage HCC and treated with ICIs and antiangiogenic therapy were included in the study, with 33 patients in the RT group and 43 patients in the non-RT group. After propensity score matching, 29 matched patient pairs were generated. The median follow-up was 15.5 months, and the RT sites were mainly located on the tumor thrombus (55.2%) and extrahepatic metastatic lesions (48.3%). The median PFS was 8.3 months (95% CI, 5.4-11.3) in the RT group and 4.2 months (95% CI, 3.4-5.0) in the NRT group (P < .001). The median OS was not reached in the RT group and was 9.7 months (95% CI, 4.1-15.3) in the NRT group (P = .002).

We conducted a phase II trial (NCT04771676) to investigate the efficacy and safety of oncolytic adenovirus H101 and virotherapy-induced immune response in 25 patients with malignant ascites. Oncolytic virotherapy achieved an increased median time to repeat paracentesis of 45 days (95% confidence interval 16.5-73.5 days), compared with the preset control value of 13 days. Therapy was well-tolerated, with pyrexia, fatigue, nausea, and abdominal pain as the most common toxicities. Longitudinal single-cell profiling identified marked oncolysis, early virus replication, and enhanced CD8(+) T cells-macrophages immune checkpoint crosstalk, especially in responsive patients. H101 also triggered a proliferative burst of CXCR6(+) and GZMK(+)CD8(+) T cells with promoted tumor-specific cytotoxicity. Further establishment of oncolytic virus-induced T cell expansion signature (OiTE) implicated the potential benefits for H101-responsive patients from subsequent anti-PD(L)1 therapy. Patients with upregulated immune-signaling pathways in tumor cells and a higher proportion of CLEC10A(+) dendritic cells and GZMK(+)CD8(+) T cells at baseline showed a superior response to H101 treatment.

Many patients with early-stage HCC do not receive curative-intent therapies. Stereotactic ablative body radiotherapy (SABR) has emerged as an effective, non-invasive HCC treatment option, however, randomized evidence for SABR in the first line setting is lacking. METHODS: Trans-Tasman Radiation Oncology Group (TROG) 21.07 SOCRATES-HCC is a phase II, prospective, randomised trial comparing SABR to other current standard of care therapies for patients with a solitary HCC ≤ 8 cm, ineligible for surgical resection or transplantation. The study is divided into 2 cohorts. Cohort 1 will compromise 118 patients with tumors ≤ 3 cm eligible for thermal ablation randomly assigned (1:1 ratio) to thermal ablation or SABR. Cohort 2 will comprise 100 patients with tumors > 3 cm up to 8 cm in size, or tumors ≤ 3 cm ineligible for thermal ablation, randomly assigned (1:1 ratio) to SABR or best other standard of care therapy including transarterial therapies. The primary objective is to determine whether SABR results in superior freedom from local progression (FFLP) at 2 years compared to thermal ablation in cohort 1 and compared to best standard of care therapy in cohort 2. Secondary endpoints include progression free survival, overall survival, adverse events, patient reported outcomes and health economic analyses. DISCUSSION: The SOCRATES-HCC study will provide the first randomized, multicentre evaluation of the efficacy, safety and cost effectiveness of SABR versus other standard of care therapies in the first line treatment of unresectable, early-stage HCC.

107,Adjuvant immunotherapy improves recurrence-free and overall survival following surgical resection for intermediate/advanced hepatocellular carcinoma a multicenter propensity matching analysis.,Xu X; Wang MD; Xu JH; Fan ZQ; Diao YK; Chen Z; Jia HD; Liu FB; Zeng YY; Wang XM; Wu H; Qiu W; Li C; Pawlik TM; Lau WY; Shen F; Lv GY; Yang T,"BACKGROUND & AIMS: The effectiveness of adjuvant immunotherapy to diminish recurrence and improve long-term prognosis following curative-intent surgical resection for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is of increased interest, especially among individuals at high risk of recurrence. The objective of the current study was to investigate the impact of adjuvant immunotherapy on long-term recurrence and survival after curative resection among patients with intermediate/advanced HCC. METHODS: Using a prospectively-collected multicenter database, patients who underwent curative-intent resection for Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC) stage B/C HCC were identified. Propensity score matching (PSM) analysis was used to compare recurrence-free survival (RFS) and overall survival (OS) between patients treated with and without adjuvant immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs). Multivariate Cox-regression analysis further identified independent factors of RFS and OS. RESULTS: Among the 627 enrolled patients, 109 patients (23.3%) received adjuvant immunotherapy. Most ICI-related adverse reactions were grading I-II. PSM analysis created 99 matched pairs of patients with comparable baseline characteristics between patients treated with and without adjuvant immunotherapy. In the PSM cohort, the median RFS (29.6 vs. 19.3 months, P=0.031) and OS (35.1 vs. 27.8 months, P=0.036) were better among patients who received adjuvant immunotherapy versus patients who did not. After adjustment for other confounding factors on multivariable analyzes, adjuvant immunotherapy remained independently associated with favorable RFS (HR: 0.630; 95% CI: 0.435-0.914; P=0.015) and OS (HR: 0.601; 95% CI: 0.401-0.898; P=0.013). Subgroup analyzes identified potentially prognostic benefits of adjuvant immunotherapy among patients with intermediate-stage and advanced-stage HCC. CONCLUSION: This real-world observational study demonstrated that adjuvant immunotherapy was associated with improved RFS and OS following curative-intent resection of intermediate/advanced HCC. Future randomized controlled trials are warranted to establish definitive evidence for this specific population at high risks of recurrence.

108,Safety and dose escalation of the targeted oncolytic adenovirus OBP-301 for refractory advanced liver cancer: Phase I clinical trial.,Heo J; Liang JD; Kim CW; Woo HY; Shih IL; Su TH; Lin ZZ; Yoo SY; Chang S; Urata Y; Chen PJ,"OBP-301 is an oncolytic adenovirus modified to replicate within cancer cells and lyse them. This open-label, non-comparative, phase I dose-escalation trial aimed to assess its safety and optimal dosage in 20 patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma. Good tolerance was shown with a maximum tolerated dose of 6 × 10(12) viral particles. The most common treatment-emergent adverse events were influenza-like illness, pyrexia, fatigue, decreased platelet count, abdominal distension, and anemia. Cohorts 4 and 5 had approximately 50% higher levels of CD8+ T cells in the peripheral blood after injection. The best target response occurred in 14 patients, 4 of whom had progressive disease. Multiple intratumoral injections of OBP-301 were well tolerated in patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma. The stable disease rate for the injected tumors was greater than the overall response rate, even with no obvious tumor response. OBP-301 might have a greater impact on local response as histological examination revealed that the presence of OBP-301 was consistent with the necrotic area at the injection site. Increased infiltration of CD8+ T cells and <1% PD-L1 expression were observed in tumors after injection. Improved antitumor efficacy might be achieved in future studies via viral injection with volume adjustment and in combination with other immuno-therapeutics. Elsevier Inc.

109,Proton beam radiotherapy versus transarterial chemoembolization for hepatocellular carcinoma: Results of a randomized clinical trial.,Bush DA; Volk M; Smith JC; Reeves ME; Sanghvi S; Slater JD; deVera M,"BACKGROUND: This study compares survival rates, recurrence patterns, toxicity, and treatment cost in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) treated with either transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) or proton beam radiotherapy (PBT). METHODS: Subjects with untreated HCC meeting Milan or San Francisco transplant criteria were recruited. Subjects were randomized to receive PBT (n = 36) or TACE (n = 40). Proton therapy was administered in 15 fractions over 3 weeks to a total dose of 70.2 Gy. TACE was repeated until complete or maximal response. The primary outcome measure was overall survival (OS). Secondary end points were progression-free survival (PFS), local control (LC), toxicity, and cost. RESULTS: Of the 76 randomized patients, 74 were assessed for outcome measures. The 2-year OS for PBT versus TACE was similar at 68%, 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.54-0.86, and 65%, 95% CI, 0.52-0.83 (p = .80), however, median PFS was improved for PBT versus TACE (not reached vs. 12 months, p = .002). LC was improved with PBT versus TACE (hazard ratio, 5.64; 95% CI, 1.78-17.9, p = .003). Days of posttreatment hospitalization were 24 for PBT and 166 for TACE (p < .001). Total mean cost per patient for treatment and posttreatment care revealed a 28% cost savings for PBT. CONCLUSIONS: PBT and TACE yielded similar OS for treatment of HCC, but PFS and LC were improved with PBT compared to TACE. Patients treated with PBT required fewer courses of treatment, fewer posttreatment hospitalization days, and reduced cost of treatment compared to TACE. These data support the use of PBT as a viable treatment alternative to TACE for patients with HCC within transplant criteria.

METHODS: We investigated the relationship between gut microbiota and seven specific gastrointestinal disorders using a robust two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) approach. The inverse variance-weighted (IVW) method was used as the primary analysis tool in our study. Furthermore, we conducted multiple sensitivity analyses to strengthen the robustness of our findings and ensure the reliability of the IVW method. RESULTS: Our research has discovered significant links between the composition of gut microbiota and a variety of gastrointestinal ailments. We found compelling links between 13 gut microbiota and fatty liver, four gut microbiota and cirrhosis, eight gut microbiota and hepatocellular carcinoma, four gut microbiota and cholelithiasis, 12 gut microbiota and acute pancreatitis, eight gut microbiota and chronic pancreatitis, and 11 gut microbiota and pancreatic cancer. These findings shed light on the intricate relationship between gut microbes and the emergence of these specific gastrointestinal conditions. CONCLUSIONS: The findings of this extensive study not only validate the potential role of specific gut microbiota in gastrointestinal diseases, but also fill a critical gap in previous research.

However, further comparative research is necessary to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of conversion surgery (CS) for iuHCC. METHODS: Data for 32 consecutive patients with iuHCC receiving CS and 419 consecutive patients with resectable HCC receiving initial surgery (IS) between November 2019 and September 2022 were collected retrospectively. After propensity score matching (PSM), 65 patients were selected. RESULTS: Before matching, the CS group had longer EFS (not reached vs. 12.9 months, P < 0.001) and similar OS (not reached vs. not reached, P = 0.510) compared with the IS group. Similar results for EFS (P = 0.001) and OS (P = 0.190) were obtained after matching. The multivariable Cox model (HR = 0.231, 95% CI: 0.105-0.504; P < 0.001) and subgroup analyses confirmed that CS could improve EFS. The CS group had significantly lower incidence of microvascular invasion (MVI) than the IS group (3.1% vs. 50.4%, P < 0.001). Moreover, the two groups had similar safety profiles.

METHODS: We conducted a prospective cohort analysis among 78,356 postmenopausal women in the Women's Health Initiative Observational Study. Two validated dietary indices, the empirical dietary index for hyperinsulinemia (EDIH) and the empirical dietary inflammation pattern (EDIP), were estimated from a food-frequency questionnaire. Incident cases of liver cancer and CLD mortality were adjudicated via review of medical records and linkage to National Death Index. Multivariable hazard ratios (HRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated using Cox proportional hazards models, adjusted for age, diabetes, body mass index, and other covariates. RESULTS: During a median 22.1 y of follow-up, we documented 176 primary liver cancer cases and 156 CLD mortality cases. EDIH was positively associated with incident liver cancer (HR(Quartile 4 vs. Quartile 1) = 1.68; 95% CI: 1.00, 2.83; P-trend = 0.05) and CLD mortality (HR(Q4 vs. Q1) = 2.28; 95% CI: 1.25, 4.15; P-trend = 0.02) in the multivariable model.

117,Female and diabetes are risk factors for alpha-fetoprotein and protein induced by vitamin K absence or antagonist-II negative in hepatocellular carcinoma.,Shi Y; Yang H; Bai X; Liu X; Li Q; Du W,"Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a common type of tumor with a high incidence. Alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) and protein induced by vitamin K absence or antagonist-II (PIVKA-II or des-gamma-carboxy prothrombin) are proven effective biomarkers for HCC. Combining them can enhance detection rates. However, when both AFP and PIVKA-II are negative, clinical diagnosis may be missed. This study aims to explore the risk factors for AFP and PIVKA-II negativity in HCC, thereby reducing missed diagnoses. A retrospective study enrolled 609 HCC patients at Shandong Public Health Clinical Center Affiliated with Shandong University from January 2010 to March 2022.

This study evaluated the efficacy and safety of tislelizumab plus lenvatinib in systemic treatment-naïve patients with uHCC. METHODS: In this multicenter, single-arm, phase 2 study, systemic treatment-naïve patients with uHCC received tislelizumab 200 mg every three weeks plus lenvatinib (bodyweight ≥ 60 kg: 12 mg; < 60 kg: 8 mg; once daily). Dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) were evaluated in safety run-in phase to determine whether to enter the expansion phase. The primary endpoint was objective response rate (ORR) assessed by independent review committee (IRC) per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors, version 1.1 (RECIST v1.1). Based on Simon's two-stage design, > 6 responders were needed in stage 1 (n = 30) to continue the study, and ≥ 18 responders were needed by the end of stage 2 (n = 60) to demonstrate statistical superiority to a historical control of lenvatinib monotherapy. RESULTS: Sixty-four patients were enrolled. No DLTs were reported. The study achieved statistical superiority (p = 0.0003) with 23 responders assessed by IRC per RECIST v1.1 in the first 60 patients of the efficacy evaluable analysis set (n = 62). After a median follow-up of 15.7 months, confirmed ORR and disease control rate were 38.7% (24/62, 95% confidence interval [CI], 26.6-51.9) and 90.3% (56/62, 95% CI, 80.1-96.4), respectively.

The present study examined whether the GRWR had an impact on the rate of HCC recurrence following living donor liver transplantation (LDLT). MATERIAL AND METHODS This retrospective observational single-center study included 856 patients who underwent LDLT for HCC between January 2006 and December 2016 at Asan Medical Center and evaluated the association between GRWR and post-transplant tumor recurrence. RESULTS Of the 856 patients who underwent LDLT for HCC, 54 (6.3%), 272 (31.8%), 274 (32.0%), and 256 (29.9%) had GRWR <0.8%, 0.8-0.99%, 1.0-1.19%, and ≥1.2%, respectively. Analysis of all patients revealed that the disease-free survival (DFS; P=0.545) and overall survival (OS; P=0.313) rates were not different in these 4 groups. Subgroups analyses also showed that GRWR did not influence survival rates in patients within (DFS: P=0.398; OS: P=0.676) and beyond (DFS: P=0.602; OS: P=0.649) the Milan criteria, or in patients with alpha-fetoprotein-des-γ-carboxyprothrombin-tumor volume scores <5log (DFS: P=0.633; OS: p=0.285) and ≥5log (DFS: P=0.674; OS: P=0.906).

MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this prospective single-center observational study, 52 patients with HCC were recruited from January 2019 to December 2021, their clinical data and blood samples were collected, and the relationship between sCCL14 and progression-free survival (PFS) and TACE treatment response was analyzed. RESULTS: Among the 52 patients with HCC (Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer [BCLC] Stage A, 25.0%; BCLC Stage B, 44.2%; and BCLC Stage C, 30.8%), patients with BCLC Stage C HCC had significantly lower sCCL14 levels than those of patients with BCLC Stages A and B HCC (P = .001). sCCL14 levels were significantly higher in the first week after treatment than before TACE treatment (P = .024). Baseline sCCL14 levels in patients who showed complete response after TACE treatment were significantly higher than those in other groups, and lower baseline sCCL14 values were associated with shorter PFS times. Multivariate Cox regression analysis showed that sCCL14 level (hazard ratio, 1.855; 95% CI, 1.039-3.311; P = .037) was an independent prognostic factor of PFS. sCCL14 levels negatively correlated with the proportion of B lymphocytes and regulatory T cells in circulating blood and positively correlated with the absolute T-lymphocyte count.

The liver function indexes and pre-treatment levels of cytokines in 47 patients were measured by chemical method and flow cytometry. The median follow-up was 23.1 months. The objective response and the disease control rates were 46.8% and 68.1%, while overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) were 12.6 and 11.4 months, respectively. Adverse events (2.1%) were grade 3-4. In addition to stage, intrahepatic metastasis and Child-Pugh score, pre-treatment interleukin-6 (IL-6) was the main cytokine affecting OS and PFS (p < 0.05). The OS (14.63 pg/mL as cutoff value) and PFS (9.85 pg/mL as cutoff value) of patients with low IL-6 levels exceeded those with high levels (21.0 and 6.9, 15.8 and 10.0 months, respectively).

This phase 2 trial (ChiCTR2000036385) aimed to investigate the activity and safety of perioperative tislelizumab plus intensity modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) for resectable HCC with MVI. Thirty treatment-naïve patients with MVI received 3 cycles of tislelizumab intravenously (200 mg, every three weeks) and concurrent IMRT (45 Gray in 15 fractions). Primary endpoints were the overall response rate (ORR) and overall survival (OS). Secondary endpoints were the proportion of patients with a complete or major pathological response (pCR or MPR), recurrence-free survival (RFS) and safety.

However, recompensation after transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) has not been studied. We evaluated the impact of recompensation after TIPS on the risk of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and death, and we compared it with compensated cirrhosis patients. METHODS: An observational study of consecutive patients with cirrhosis undergoing TIPS between 2008 and 2022 was performed. Baveno VII definition of recompensation was used including patients with or without diuretics/Hepatic encephalopathy prophylaxis. A prospective cohort of consecutive compensated cirrhosis patients was used for comparison. RESULTS: Overall, 208 patients with cirrhosis were included, 92 compensated and 116 decompensated who underwent TIPS. After 1 year, 24% achieved recompensation. Liver function (MELD 12 ± 5 vs. 15 ± 6; p = .049), LDL-cholesterol (97 mg/dL vs. 76 mg/dL, p = .018), white cell count (7.96 × 10(9)/dL vs. 6.24 × 10(9)/dL, p = .039) and platelets (129 × 10(9)/dL vs. 101 × 10(9)/dL, p = .039) were associated with recompensation. Recompensation was associated with a reduction in the risk of HCC (p = .020). Multivariable analysis showed that this risk was significantly higher in non-recompensated patients (p = .003) but no differences were observed in recompensated compared with compensated patients (p = .816). Similarly, decompensated patients presented lower survival rates (p = .011), while no differences were observed between recompensated and compensated patients (p = .677).

Retrospectively, 114 HCC patients with pretherapeutic CT of the liver were randomized into a development (n = 85) and a validation (n = 29) cohort, including patients of all tumor stages and several applied therapies. In addition to clinical parameters, image annotations of the liver parenchyma and of tumor findings on CT were available. Cox-regression based on radiomics features and CNN models were established and combined with clinical parameters to predict OS. Model performance was assessed using the concordance index (C-index). Log-rank tests were used to test model-based patient stratification into high/low-risk groups. The clinical Cox-regression model achieved the best validation performance for OS (C-index [95% confidence interval (CI)] 0.74 [0.57-0.86]) with a significant difference between the risk groups (p = 0.03). In image analysis, the CNN models (lowest C-index [CI] 0.63 [0.39-0.83]; highest C-index [CI] 0.71 [0.49-0.88]) were superior to the corresponding radiomics models (lowest C-index [CI] 0.51 [0.30-0.73]; highest C-index [CI] 0.66 [0.48-0.79]).

MATERIAL AND METHODS: From July 2017 to January 2019, 148 patients with HBV-related HCC who underwent curative liver resection were randomized to receive TDF ( n =74) or ETV ( n =74) therapy. The primary end point was tumor recurrence in the intention-to-treat population. Overall survival and tumor recurrence of patients were compared by multivariable-adjusted Cox regression and competing risk analyses. RESULTS: During the follow-up with continued antiviral therapy, 37 (25.0%) patients developed tumor recurrence, and 16 (10.8%) patients died ( N =15) or received liver transplantation ( N =1). In the intention-to-treat cohort, the recurrence-free survival for the TDF group was significantly better than that for the ETV group ( P =0.026). In the multivariate analysis, the relative risks of recurrence and death/liver transplantation for ETV therapy were 3.056 (95% CI: 1.015-9.196; P =0.047) and 2.566 (95% CI: 1.264-5.228; P =0.009), respectively.

We sought to identify promising topics for alcohol warnings. METHODS: In January 2024, we recruited a convenience sample of 2,522 US adults ages ≥ 21 years. In an online within-subjects experiment, participants viewed messages about 6 topics (5 warning topics selected from a pool of 16 topics [e.g., liver disease, liver cancer] and 1 control topic [i.e., recycling or reselling products]) shown in random order. For each topic, participants viewed and rated 2 statements about that topic on perceived message effectiveness (primary outcome) and reactance (secondary outcome). RESULTS: The 16 warning topics elicited higher perceived message effectiveness than the control topic (ps < 0.001). Among the warning topics, liver disease, most cancer types, dementia or mental decline, and hypertension elicited the highest perceived message effectiveness, while breast cancer, sleep, and drinking guidelines elicited the lowest. Fourteen of the 16 warning topics (all except for fetal harms and impaired driving) elicited more reactance than the control topic (ps < 0.001). Warning topics that elicited high perceived message effectiveness generally elicited high reactance, except for messages about liver disease and liver cancer, which elicited high perceived message effectiveness but only moderate reactance.

127,Cost-effectiveness analysis of Tislelizumab vs Sorafenib as the first-line treatment of unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma.,Chen Q; Sun Q; Zhang J; Li B; Feng Q; Liu J,"BACKGROUND: To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of Tislelizumab vs Sorafenib as the first-line treatment of unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) from the perspective of the Chinese health service system. METHODS: A lifetime partitioned survival model (PSM) was developed to cost-effectively analyze Tislelizumab vs Sorafenib as the first-line treatment of unresectable HCC. The clinical and safety data were derived from a recently randomized clinical trial (RATIONALE-301). Utilities were collected from the published literature. Costs were obtained from an open-access database (http://www.yaozh.com) and previous studies. The model cycle was 21 days, according to the RATIONALE-301 study, and the simulation period was patients' lifetime. Long-term direct medical costs and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) were determined. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) was used as the evaluation index. one-way sensitivity analysis (OSWA) and probabilistic sensitivity analysis (PSA) were used to analyze the uncertainty of parameters and to adjust and verify the stability of the baseline results. RESULTS: The Tislelizumab group generated a cost of $39,746.34 and brought health benefits to 2.146 QALYs, while the cost and utility of the Sorafenib group were $26750.95 and 1.578 QALYs, respectively. The Tislelizumab group increased QALYs by 0.568, the incremental cost was $12995.39, and the ICER was $22869.64/QALY, lower than the willingness to pay threshold (WTP). OSWA results showed that the utility of progressed disease (PD), cost of Camrelizumab, and cost of Tislelizumab were the main factors affecting the ICER. PSA results showed that, within 1000 times the Monte Carlo simulation, the cost of the Tislelizumab group was lower than three times the per capita gross domestic product (GDP) of China ($37653/QALY). The cost-effectiveness acceptability curves (CEAC) revealed that when WTP was no less than $12251.00, the Tislelizumab group was the dominant scheme, and the economic advantage grew with an increasing WTP. When WTP ≥ $19000.00, the Tislelizumab group became the absolute economic advantage. CONCLUSION: Under the current economic conditions in China, the Tislelizumab therapeutic scheme is more cost-effective than the Sorafenib therapeutic scheme for treating patients with unresectable HCC. the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original author and source are credited.",False,"Outcome is not survival or response rate, and study design is not a randomized controlled trial.",patients with unresectable HCC,Tislelizumab,Sorafenib,cost-effectiveness and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs),partitioned survival model (PSM),True,Meets criteria as it compares Tislelizumab vs Sorafenib for unresectable HCC,-,-,-,-,-,False,Outcome is not survival or response rate and study design is not a randomized controlled trial,False
128,Liver resection for hepatocellular and fibrolamellar carcinoma in a South African tertiary referral centre - an observational cohort analysis.,Ziaei Y; Krige JEJ; Jonas EG; Kotze UK; Bernon MM; Kloppers C; Sobnach S,"BACKGROUND: More than 80% of global hepatocellular carcinomas (HCC) occur in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) and South- East Asia. Compared with the rest of the world, HCC in SSA has the lowest resection and survival rates. This study assessed outcome following liver resection for HCC and fibrolamellar carcinoma (FLC) at a tertiary referral centre in South Africa. METHODS: A retrospective analysis was done of all liver resections for HCC and FLC at Groote Schuur Hospital and the University of Cape Town Private Academic Hospital between January 1990 and December 2021. Three groups were compared, (i) HCC occurring in normal livers, (ii) HCC occurring in cirrhotic livers, and (iii) fibrolamellar carcinoma. Postoperative complications were classified as per the expanded accordion severity grading system. Median overall survival (OS) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated. RESULTS: Forty-eight patients were included in the study, 25 for HCC in non-cirrhotic livers, 15 in cirrhotic livers and eight for FLC. Thirty-six patients (75%) underwent a major resection. No mortality occurred but 16 patients (33%) developed grade 1 to 4 complications postoperatively. Thirty-three patients (69%) developed recurrence of HCC following their initial resection of whom 29 (60%) ultimately died. Median overall survival (OS) for the total cohort after surgery was 57.2 months, 95% CI (29.7-84.6), 64.2 months (29.7-84.6), 61.9 months (28.1-95.6), and 31.7 months (1.5-61.8) for patients with HCC in non-cirrhotic livers, FLC and HCC in cirrhotic livers respectively.

Whether beta-blockers could additionally enhance the effects during treatment, particularly for small esophageal varices (EV), was unclear. This study aims to assess the efficacy of add-on carvedilol to delay EV progression during anti-hepatitis B virus (HBV) treatment in HBV-related cirrhosis. METHODS: This randomized controlled trial enrolled patients with virologically suppressed HBV-compensated cirrhosis and small/medium EV. The participants were randomly assigned to receive nucleos(t)ide analog (NUC) or carvedilol 12.5 mg plus NUC (1:1 allocation ratio). The primary end point was the progression rate of EV at 2 years of follow-up. RESULTS: A total of 238 patients (small EV, 77.3%) were randomized into 119 NUC and 119 carvedilol plus NUC (carvedilol [CARV] combination group). Among them, 205 patients (86.1%) completed paired endoscopies. EV progression rate was 15.5% (16/103) in the NUC group and 12.7% (13/102) in the CARV combination group (relative risk = 0.79, 95% confidence interval 0.36-1.75, P = 0.567). Subgroup analysis on medium EV showed the CARV combination group had a more favorable effect in promoting EV regression (43.5% vs 13.1%, P = 0.022) than NUC alone, but not in small cases ( P = 0.534). The incidence of liver-related events (decompensation, hepatocellular carcinoma, or death/liver transplantation) within 2 years was similar between the 2 groups (11.2% vs 10.4%, P = 0.881).

130,Preoperative dexamethasone administration in hepatectomy of 25-min intermittent Pringle's maneuver for hepatocellular carcinoma: protocol for a randomized controlled trial.,Huang Y; Xu L; Wang N; Pu X; Wang W; Wen T; Xu M; Jiang L,"BACKGROUND: Our previous randomized controlled trial (RCT) have demonstrated that intermittent Pringle's maneuver (IPM) with a 25-min ischemic interval can be applied safely and efficiently in open or laparoscopic hepatectomy in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients. But prolonging the hepatic inflow blocking time will inevitably aggravate the ischemia-reperfusion injury (IRI) caused by systemic response. This RCT aims to evaluate the effect of administration of dexamethasone versus placebo before clamping the hilar pedicle on postoperative liver function, inflammatory response, and perioperative outcomes among HCC patients undergoing liver resection with 25-min hepatic inflow occlusion. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: This will be a randomized, dual-arm, parallel-group, double-blinded trial. All eligible and consecutive patients are coming from a regional medical center who are diagnosed with HCC and underwent radical R0/R1 resection. All participates are randomly allocated in dexamethasone group or placebo group. All surgeons, anesthesiologists, and outcome assessors will be blinded to allocation status. Primary endpoints are transaminase-based postoperative hepatic injury on seven consecutive days after surgery and assessed by their peak values as well as area under the curve (AUC) of the postoperative course of aminotransferases. Secondary endpoints are postoperative total bilirubin (TBil), coagulation function, inflammatory cytokines and their respective peaks, intraoperative blood loss, postoperative hospital stay, morbidity, and mortality. The above parameters will be compared using the corresponding statistical approach. Subgroup analysis will be performed according to the liver cirrhosis and major hepatectomy. DISCUSSION: Based on our previous study, we will explore further the effect of glucocorticoid administration on attenuating the surgical stress response in order to follow securely 25-min hepatic inflow occlusion. Therefore, the trial protocol is reasonable and the results of the trial may be clinically significant. TRIAL REGISTRATION: This trial was registered on 3 December 2022, in the Chinese Clinical Trial Registry ( http://www.chictr.org.cn ), ChiCTR2200066381.

131,Preoperative Diagnosis of Dual-Phenotype Hepatocellular Carcinoma Using Enhanced MRI Radiomics Models.,Wu Q; Yu YX; Zhang T; Zhu WJ; Fan YF; Wang XM; Hu CH,"BACKGROUND: Dual-phenotype hepatocellular carcinoma (DPHCC) is highly aggressive and difficult to distinguish from hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). PURPOSE: To develop and validate clinical and radiomics models based on contrast-enhanced MRI for the preoperative diagnosis of DPHCC. STUDY TYPE: Retrospective. POPULATION: A total of 87 patients with DPHCC and 92 patients with non-DPHCC randomly divided into a training cohort (n = 125: 64 non-DPHCC; 61 DPHCC) and a validation cohort (n = 54: 28 non-DPHCC; 26 DPHCC). FIELD STRENGTH/SEQUENCE: A 3.0 T; dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI with time-resolved T1-weighted imaging sequence. ASSESSMENT: In the clinical model, the maximum tumor diameter and hepatitis B virus (HBV) were independent risk factors of DPHCC. In the radiomics model, a total of 1781 radiomics features were extracted from tumor volumes of interest (VOIs) in the arterial phase (AP) and portal venous phase (PP) images. For feature reduction and selection, Pearson correlation coefficient (PCC) and recursive feature elimination (RFE) were used. Clinical, AP, PP, and combined radiomics models were established using machine learning algorithms (support vector machine [SVM], logistic regression [LR], and logistic regression-least absolute shrinkage and selection operator [LR-LASSO]) and their discriminatory efficacy assessed and compared. STATISTICAL TESTS: The independent sample t test, Mann-Whitney U test, Chi-square test, regression analysis, receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) analysis, Pearson correlation analysis, the Delong test. A P value < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. RESULTS: In the validation cohort, the combined radiomics model (area under the curve [AUC] = 0.908, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.831-0.985) showed the highest diagnostic performance. The AUCs of the PP (AUC = 0.879, 95% CI: 0.779-0.979) and combined radiomics models were significantly higher than that of clinical model (AUC = 0.685, 95% CI: 0.526-0.844). There were no significant differences in AUC between AP or PP radiomics model and combined radiomics model (P = 0.286, 0.180 and 0.543).

This study aimed to investigate the efficacy and safety of TACE combined with envafolimab and lenvatinib for uHCC. Eligible patients with uHCC received envafolimab and lenvatinib after TACE until disease progression, conversion to surgery, intolerable toxicities, or death. The primary endpoint was the objective response rate (ORR) assessed according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1 criteria. Between March 2022 and July 2022, 38 patients were included for safety analysis, and 36 patients were included for efficacy analysis. As of the data cutoff (13 December 2023), the median follow-up was 16.9 months. The ORR was 50%, and disease control rate (DCR) was 83.3% per RECIST 1.1 (ORR and DCR of both 83.3% per modified RECIST (mRECIST)). The median progression-free survival (PFS) was 7.58 months. Of 36 patients, 17 patients were converted to resectable HCC with a surgical conversion rate of 47.2%, and 16 patients underwent surgery with R0 resection rate of 100%, pathologic complete response (pCR) rate of 31.3%. Overall incidences of treatment-related adverse events (TRAEs) of any grade was 97.4%. Grade ≥ 3 TRAEs were observed in 52.6% patients. No treatment-related deaths occurred.

This report sought to provide a long-term analysis of OS. Methods: In this phase II study (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier NCT02582034), treatment was randomly assigned (1:1) with the goal to deliver either at least 205 Gy (if possible >250-300 Gy) to the index lesion in the personalized dosimetry approach (PDA) or 120 ± 20 Gy to the treated volume in the standard dosimetry approach (SDA). The 3-mo response of the index lesion was the primary endpoint, with OS being one of the secondary endpoints. This report is a post hoc long-term analysis of OS. Results: Overall, 60 hepatocellular carcinoma patients with at least 1 lesion larger than 7 cm and more than 30% of hepatic reserve were randomized (intent-to-treat population: PDA, n = 31; SDA, n = 29), with 56 actually treated (modified intent-to-treat population: n = 28 in each arm). The median follow-up for long-term analysis was 65.8 mo (range, 2.1-73.1 mo).

PETAL evaluated safety, preliminary activity of TACE plus pembrolizumab and explored mechanisms of efficacy. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients with liver-confined hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) were planned to receive up to two rounds of TACE followed by pembrolizumab 200 mg every 21 days commencing 30 days post-TACE until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity for up to 1 year. Primary endpoint was safety, with assessment window of 21 days from pembrolizumab initiation. Secondary endpoints included progression-free survival (PFS) and evaluation of tumor and host determinants of response. RESULTS: Fifteen patients were included in the safety and efficacy population: 73% had nonviral cirrhosis; median age was 72 years. Child-Pugh class was A in 14 patients. Median tumor size was 4 cm. Ten patients (67%) received pembrolizumab after one TACE; 5 patients after two (33%). Pembrolizumab yielded no synergistic toxicity nor dose-limiting toxicities post-TACE. Treatment-related adverse events occurred in 93% of patients, most commonly skin rash (40%), fatigue, and diarrhea (27%). After a median follow-up of 38.5 months, objective response rate 12 weeks post-TACE was 53%.

136,Efficacy of dexamethasone and N-acetylcysteine combination in preventing post-embolization syndrome after transarterial chemoembolization in hepatocellular carcinoma.,Simasingha N; Tanasoontrarat W; Claimon T; Sethasine S,"BACKGROUND: Conventional transarterial chemoembolization (cTACE) is the current standard treatment for intermediate-stage hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Post-embolization syndrome (PES) is complex clinical syndrome that presents as fever, abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting. Either dexamethasone (DEXA) or N-acetylcysteine (NAC) is used to prevent PES; however, the synergistic effect of their combined therapy for preventing PES and liver decompensation has not been determined. AIM: To evaluate the efficacy of DEXA and NAC combination in preventing PES and liver decompensation after cTACE. METHODS: Patients with Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer stage A or B HCC who were scheduled for TACE were prospectively enrolled. All patients were randomly stratified to receive NAC and DEXA or placebo. The dual therapy (NAC + DEXA) group received intravenous administration of 10 mg DEXA every 12 h, NAC 24 h prior to cTACE (150 mg/kg/h for 1 h followed by 12.5 mg/kg/h for 4 h), and a continuous infusion of 6.25 mg/h NAC plus 4 mg DEXA every 12 h for 48 h after cTACE. The placebo group received an infusion of 5% glucose solution until 48 h after procedure. PES was defined by South West Oncology Group toxicity code grading of more than 2 that was calculated using incidence of fever, nausea, vomiting, and pain. RESULTS: One-hundred patients were enrolled with 50 patients in each group. Incidence of PES was significantly lower in the NAC + DEXA group compared with in the placebo group (6% vs 80%; P < 0.001). Multivariate analysis showed that the dual treatment is a protective strategic therapy against PES development [odds ratio (OR) = 0.04; 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.01-0.20; P < 0.001). Seven (14%) patients in the placebo group, but none in the NAC + DEXA group, developed post-TACE liver decompensation. A dynamic change in Albumin-Bilirubin score of more than 0.5 point was found to be a risk factor for post-TACE liver decompensation (OR = 42.77; 95%CI: 1.01-1810; P = 0.049).

Systemic therapy is generally recommended as second-line treatment for advanced HCC in the major guidelines. Combining apatinib with hepatic arterial infusion chemotherapy (HAIC) likely drives synergistic activity on advanced HCC with extrahepatic metastasis. This phase II trial (ChiCTR2000029082) aimed to assess efficacy and safety of this combination in patients with HCC with extrahepatic metastasis who have progressed after first-line systemic therapies.

138,Objective Tumor Response of Hepatocellular Carcinoma Obtained by Transarterial Radioembolization with Iodine-131-Lipiodol Versus Transarterial Chemoembolization for Patients with and without Portal Venous Thrombosis: A Controlled Interventional Trial.,Oliveira Ribeiro MC; Moda KA; Alvarez M; Koga KH; Moriguchi SM; Carvalho FC; Pinheiro RSN; Qi X; Romeiro FG,"RATIONALE AND OBJECTIVES: Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) treatment often requires transarterial chemoembolization (TACE). However, TACE efficacy is controversial in the presence of portal vein thrombosis (PVT). Although transarterial radioembolization (TARE) benefit was previously documented in PVT, neither the objective tumor response (OTR) after TARE with Iodine-131-lipiodol ((131)I-lipiodol) nor the PVT effect on the results of locoregional therapies was accurately measured in prospective clinical trials. The aim of this study was to compare OTR and survival obtained by TARE with (131)I-lipiodol versus TACE in patients with cirrhosis and HCC, as well as between those with and without PVT. MATERIALS AND METHODS: 33 patients were included, from whom 38 tumors were assessed. OTR was quantified by a special algorithm to measure hypervascular HCC tissue. RESULTS: 19 tumors received each therapy. Nine subjects (27%) had PVT, most of them in the TARE group (p = 0.026). Mean OTR according to the tumor volumes was 24.2% ± 56% after TARE and 32.8% ± 48.9% after TACE, with no difference between the treatments (p = 0.616). Similar values were also observed between those with and without PVT (p = 0.704). Mean survival was 340 days and did not differ between the two treatments (p = 0.596), but was 194 days in PVT cases (p = 0.007). CONCLUSIONS: This is the first study in which OTR obtained by TARE with (131)I-lipiodol is accurately measured. Additionally, PVT impact on survival after TARE and TACE was precisely documented. Although the TARE group had more PVT subjects (who had shorter survival), TARE and TACE achieved similar OTR and OS rates. Elsevier Inc.

Due to the lack of date in Europe, this study aims to assess survival of patients with HCC according sex in a tertiary French liver center. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Every patient diagnosed with a first diagnosis of HCC presented at our weekly multidisciplinary tumor board between 2013 and 2017 were included. Baseline characteristics of patients and tumors were compared according sex using the Mann-Whitney test for Continuous variables and the Fisher or Chi-square test for dichotomous variables. Survival analyses according sex were conducted using the Kaplan-Meier method, the log-rank test, Cox models and a propensity score. RESULTS: 694 patients were included, of whom 130 (18.7 %) were women. Among them, 587 (86 %) had cirrhosis, mainly compensated (Child A 62.7 %), and related to alcohol (48.7 %), HCV (27.2 %), and/or metabolic-associated fatty liver disease (25.8 %). HCC was unifocal in 54 % of cases, with a mean main nodule size of 37 mm. Curative treatment was administered in 45.4 % of cases (percutaneous ablation 93 %). Compared to men, women diagnosed with HCC were older (73 vs. 65 years, p < 0.001), were more frequently HCV-infected (40 % vs. 24 %, p = 0.0003) and presented more often with a solitary HCC (63 % vs. 52 %, p = 0.020).

METHODS: A randomized controlled trial (RCT) was conducted with 144 patients, who were randomly assigned to receive either DEB-TACE with doxorubicin-loaded CalliSpheres(®) microspheres or cTACE with doxorubicin-lipiodol emulsion. Patients were followed up for 12 months, with assessments at 3 and 12 months posttreatment. The primary endpoint was the clinical response rate (CR), and the secondary endpoints were the overall survival (OS), the progression-free survival (PFS), and the safety profile of the two treatments. RESULTS: The results showed that DEB-TACE was superior to cTACE in terms of CR (50.0% vs 30.6% at 3 months, p = 0.03; 43.1% vs 25.0% at 12 months, p = 0.04), OS (18.2 months vs 14.6 months, p < 0.05), and PFS (7.4 months vs 4.8 months, p < 0.05), and that the safety profile of the two treatments was similar (p > 0.05 for all comparisons). However, the efficacy of DEB-TACE and cTACE varied according to the tumor morphology. DEB-TACE showed better CR rates in patients with nodular tumors, while no significant difference in CR between the two groups in patients with infiltrative tumors. CONCLUSION: DEB-TACE showed superior efficacy to cTACE in terms of CR, OS, and PFS, particularly in patients with nodular tumors, while maintaining a similar safety profile.

We aimed to assess the efficacy of irradiation stent placement with 125 I plus transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (TACE) (ISP-TACE) compared to sorafenib plus TACE (Sora-TACE) in these patients. METHODS: In this multicenter randomized controlled trial, participants with HCC and Vp4 PVTT without extrahepatic metastases were enrolled from November 2018 to July 2021 at 16 medical centers. The primary endpoint was overall survival (OS). The secondary endpoints were hepatic function, time to symptomatic progression, patency of portal vein, disease control rate, and treatment safety. RESULTS: Of 105 randomized participants, 51 were assigned to the ISP-TACE group, and 54 were assigned to the Sora-TACE group. The median OS was 9.9 months versus 6.3 months (95% CI: 0.27-0.82; P =0.01). Incidence of acute hepatic decompensation was 16% (8 of 51) versus 33% (18 of 54) ( P =0.036). The time to symptomatic progression was 6.6 months versus 4.2 months (95% CI: 0.38-0.93; P =0.037). The median stent patency was 7.2 months (interquartile range, 4.7-9.3) in the ISP-TACE group.

The purpose of our study was to explore the clinical value of postoperative adjuvant anti-programed cell death 1 antibody (PA-PD-1) on the prognosis of HCC patients with high relapse risks after surgery. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Data of consecutive HCC patients with high recurrence risks treated with liver resection at our center during January 2019 and March 2021 were prospectively collected. Baseline differences were balanced between HCC patients with (PA-PD-1 group) or without PA-PD-1 (non-PD-1 group) after hepatectomy by propensity-score matching (PSM). Between these two groups, we compared overall survival (OS) and recurrence-free survival (RFS). Independent prognostic risk factors for OS and RFS were confirmed by Cox regression analysis, and subgroup analysis was also performed. RESULTS: 47 pairs of patients with or without PD-1 treatment after hepatectomy were matched. After PSM, the 1-year and 2-year RFS was 58.4% and 44.1% in the PA-PD-1 group, and 34.0% and 21.3% in the non-PD-1 group (p = 0.008). The OS at 1 year and 2 years was 91.2% and 91.2% in the PA-PD-1 group, compared with 85.1% and 61.7% in the non-PD-1 group (p = 0.024). Multivariable analyses demonstrated that PA-PD-1 was an independent protective predictor associated with RFS and OS. Through subgroup analysis, we concluded that HCC patients with portal venous tumor thrombus (PVTT) or tumor size ≥ 5 cm significantly benefited from PA-PD-1 therapy in RFS and OS.

In this multi-center randomized controlled trial ""PARADISE study"" (NCT05671315), CHB patients with intermediate to high risk of HCC after more than 24-week NAs pretreatment were recruited, randomized to two groups at a ratio of 1:2 and followed up for 240 weeks. NAs group maintained NAs monotherapy, while IFN + NAs group received IFN add-on NAs therapy for 48 weeks, then switched to NAs monotherapy. Totally, 196 patients were included in interim analysis (NAs group 68, IFN + NAs group 128). The 96-week cumulative HCC incidence was lower in IFN + NAs group than NAs group (0% vs. 4.5%, p < 0.05). Compared with NAs group, IFN + NAs group had significantly higher rates of HBsAg loss at week 48 and 96 (22.7% vs. 0%; 16.7% vs. 0%, both p < 0.05). A new scoring system was established to predict HBsAg decline >2log10 IU/ml, HBsAg <10 IU/ml or HBsAg loss at the end of 48-week IFN treatment.

METHODS: Patients with suspected malignant liver lesions (MLL) underwent [(18)F]FDG and [(18)F]FAPI-04 PET/CT scanning. Liver lesions were visually classified as positive or negative based on their uptake level exceeding that of adjacent normal liver tissue. SUVmax and tumor-to-background ratio (TBR) were recorded for semi-quantitative analysis. Sensitivity, specificity and accuracy of each tracer were determined using pathological findings as the gold standard. Furthermore, immunohistochemical analysis provided the molecular characteristics of all MLLs. Comprehensive analysis explored correlations between these molecular markers and PET semiquantitative parameters (SUVmax andTBR) to identify potential associations. RESULTS: The study enrolled 44 patients, with 39 confirmed cases of MLL, comprising 28 hepatocellular carcinomas (HCC) and 11 intrahepatic cholangiocarcinomas (ICC). For MLL detection, [(18)F]FAPI-04 and [(18)F]FDG exhibited sensitivities of 84.6% (33/39) and 76.9% (30/39), specificitiesy of 60% (3/5) and 100%(5/5), and accuracy of 81.8% (36/44) and 79.5%(35/44). Across all liver lesions, [(18)F]FAPI-04 significantly surpassed [(18)F]FDG in SUVmax(10.54 ± 6.72 VS. 7.68 ± 6.79) and TBR(4.35 ± 3.78 Vs. 3.17 ± 3.05). Notably, [(18)F]FAPI-04 displayed markebly elevated SUVmax in benign liver lesions (BLLs) (P = 0.032), HCCs (P = 0.005), and ICCs (P = 0.011). Lesions with hepatocyte negativity (P = 0.023), CD34 negativity(P = 0.044), and high Ki67 expression (> 30%) (P = 0.001) had higher SUVmax on [(18)F]FAPI-04. Additionally, ARG-1-negative lesions demonstrated higher TBR on [(18)F]FAPI-04 than ARG-1-positive lesions(P = 0.018). No significant SUVmax/TBR differences were observed with [(18)F]FDG based on these markers. A linear relationship was identified between Ki67 scores and SUVmax of [(18)F]FAPI-04 (R = 0.603, P < 0.001). CONCLUSION: [(18)F]FAPI-04 exhibits superior performance over [(18)F]FDG in PET/CT evaluation of liver cancer, characterized by increased sensitivity and SUVmax/TBR. Significant correlations with molecular markers, including Ki67, suggest [(18)F]FAPI-04's potential for characterizing liver cancer subtypes and assessing tumor proliferation.

The current study assessed the safety and efficacy of molecular targeted agents (MTAs) in the elderly patients with HCC, and identified factors associated with prognosis in a real-world clinical setting. METHODS: In a retrospective observational study, clinical data of patients with unresectable HCC treated with sorafenib or lenvatinib as first-line treatment at our hospital between 2011 and 2022, were investigated. Clinical parameters, therapeutic effects, adverse events (AEs), and prognosis were evaluated separately for the non-elderly (<75 years old) and elderly patients (≥75 years old). RESULTS: Overall, 111 patients were enrolled, including 59 non-elderly and 52 elderly patients. Compared to the non-elderly patients, the elderly patients had significantly lower skeletal muscle mass and a significantly lower percentage of patients in poor general condition with performance status 2 or higher, but there were no differences in parameters related to liver function or nutritional status. There were no significant differences in the incidence of severe AEs and therapeutic effects between the groups. No significant difference in progression-free survival was observed in the elderly and non-elderly patients; however, overall survival (OS) for sorafenib treatment was shorter in the elderly patients than in the non-elderly patients. Elderly patients consumed lower doses of both the drugs, and relative dose intensity (RDI) 4 weeks after treatment (4W-RDI) was associated with OS. Further, OS in the elderly patients was significantly longer in the subgroup with high 4W-RDI as compared to that in the subgroup with low 4W-RDI. CONCLUSIONS: MTAs can be safely administered to elderly patients with HCC. Furthermore, 4W-RDI is associated with longer OS.

RESIN is the first real-life clinical study of this therapy in an Asian cohort. Study objectives were to evaluate the safety and efficacy of (90)Y resin microspheres. METHODS: Adults with HCC or mCRC scheduled to receive SIRT with (90)Y resin microspheres were included. Primary endpoints were best overall response rate (ORR), adverse events, and changes from baseline in liver function. Secondary efficacy endpoints included overall survival (OS). RESULTS: Of 107 enrolled patients, 83 had HCC, and 24 had mCRC. ORR was 55.41% (HCC) and 33.33% (mCRC). Of 58 HCC patients with 6-month post-SIRT data, 13.79% (n = 8) had resection, transplantation, transarterial chemoembolization, or radiofrequency ablation as the result of down-staging or down-sizing of their lesions. One hundred and ten treatment emergent adverse events (TEAEs) were reported in 51 patients, and five serious adverse events (SAEs) were reported in five patients. The most frequent TEAEs were abdominal pain, nausea and decreased appetite (HCC), and abdominal pain, decreased appetite, fatigue, and vomiting (mCRC). Two deaths due to SAEs (probably related to SIRT) were reported, both in patients with extensive HCC, active hepatitis infection, and other comorbidities.

Herein, we have developed a machine learning (ML) model that can predict patient survival and guide treatment decisions. We obtained patient demographic information, tumor characteristics, and treatment details from the SEER database. To analyze the data, we employed a Cox proportional hazards (CoxPH) model as well as 3 ML algorithms: neural network multitask logistic regression (N-MLTR), DeepSurv, and random survival forest (RSF). Our evaluation relied on the concordance index (C-index) and Integrated Brier Score (IBS). Additionally, we provided personalized treatment recommendations regarding surgery and chemotherapy choices and validated models' efficacy. A total of 1136 patients with early-stage (I, II) hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) who underwent liver resection or transplantation were randomly divided into training and validation cohorts at a ratio of 3:7. Feature selection was conducted using Cox regression analyses. The ML models (NMLTR: C-index = 0.6793; DeepSurv: C-index = 0.7028; RSF: C-index = 0.6890) showed better discrimination in predicting survival than the standard CoxPH model (C-index = 0.6696). Patients who received recommended treatments had higher survival rates than those who received unrecommended treatments. ML-based surgery treatment recommendations yielded higher hazard ratios (HRs): NMTLR HR = 0.36 (95% CI: 0.25-0.51, P < .001), DeepSurv HR = 0.34 (95% CI: 0.24-0.49, P < .001), and RSF HR = 0.37 (95% CI: 0.26-0.52, P = <.001). Chemotherapy treatment recommendations were associated with significantly improved survival for DeepSurv (HR: 0.57; 95% CI: 0.4-0.82, P = .002) and RSF (HR: 0.66; 95% CI: 0.46-0.94, P = .020).

AIM: To assess HBsAg recurrence after seroclearance achieved by peg-IFN-α regimens. METHODS: This prospective, multicenter, observational study was conducted from November 2015 to June 2021 at three Chinese hospitals: The Second Affiliated Hospital of Xi'an Jiaotong University, Ankang Central Hospital, and The Affiliated Hospital of Yan'an University. Participants who achieved HBsAg seroclearance following peg-IFN-α-based treatments were monitored every 4-12 weeks post-treatment for hepatitis B virus (HBV) markers, HBV DNA, and liver function. The primary outcome was HBV recurrence, defined as the reemergence of HBsAg, HBV DNA, or both, at least twice within 4-8 weeks of follow-up. RESULTS: In total, 121 patients who achieved HBsAg seroclearance were enrolled. After a median follow-up of 84.0 (48.0, 132.0) weeks, four subjects were lost to follow-up. HBsAg recurrence was detected in 16 patients. The cumulative HBsAg recurrence rate in the intention-to-treat population was 15.2%.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients with Child-Pugh (CP) A to B7 liver function with aggregate tumor size >3.5 cm, or CP ≥ B8 with any size tumor were prospectively enrolled on an Institutional Review Board-approved phase II clinical trial to undergo SBRT with baseline and midtreatment dose optimization using a quantitative, individualized utility-based analysis. Primary endpoints were change in CP score of ≥2 points within 6 months and local control. Protocol-treated patients were compared with patients receiving conventional SBRT at another cancer center using overlap weighting. RESULTS: A total of 56 patients with 80 treated tumors were analyzed with a median follow-up of 11.2 months. Two-year cumulative incidence of local progression was 6.4% [95% confidence interval (CI, 2.4-13.4)].

Currently, no approved adjuvant therapy has been shown to reduce HCC recurrence rates. In this study, the in vivo effect of sequential combination treatment with recombinant mouse interferon-alpha (rmIFN-α) and an anti-mouse-PD1 antibody on hepatitis B virus (HBV) clearance in mice was evaluated. A Phase I clinical trial was then conducted to assess the safety, tolerability, and inhibitory activity of sequential therapy with ropeginterferon alfa-2b and nivolumab in patients with HCC recurrence who underwent curative surgery for HBV-related HCC. The animal modeling study showed that HBV suppression was significantly greater with the rmIFN-α and anti-PD1 sequential combination treatment in comparison with sole treatment with rmIFN-α or anti-PD1. In the Phase I study, eleven patients completed the sequential therapy with ropeginterferon alfa-2b every two weeks for six doses at 450 µg, followed by three doses of nivolumab every two weeks up to 0.75 mg/kg. A notable decrease in or clearance of HBV surface antigen was observed in two patients. The dose-limiting toxicity of grade 3 alanine transaminase and aspartate aminotransferase increases was observed in one patient. The maximum tolerated dose was then determined.

151,The effect of switch therapy to tenofovir versus entecavir maintenance on recurrence of hepatocellular carcinoma after surgery (SWITE): study protocol for a randomized controlled trial.,Peng W; Yi M; Qi X; Qi W; Li C; Wen T,"BACKGROUND: Antiviral therapy has been reported to be associated with lower recurrence rate of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) for patients with hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection. While entecavir (ETV) and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) were both recommended as first-line therapies for HBV patients, recent retrospective studies proposed a lower incidence rate of HCC occurrence or recurrence in those receiving TDF compared ETV. However, the survival benefits of switching to TDF therapy after prolonged ETV treatment before surgery remain uncertain. We delineate the rationale and design of SWITE, a randomized, open-label, phase III trial contrasting TDF switch therapy versus ETV maintenance in HBV-related HCC patients. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: This is a prospective, randomized, controlled, single-center study with two parallel groups of patients with HBV-related HCC who have received long-term ETV therapy before surgery. West China Hospital will enroll 238 patients, randomized in a 1:1 ratio to TDF switch therapy or ETV maintenance after surgery. The primary endpoint of this study is 3-year recurrence free survival (RFS), with the secondary endpoint being 3-year overall survival (OS) after curative surgery of HCC.

Patients who had HCV-UN at baseline were 3.5 times more likely to progress and/or die from HCC compared with HCV detectable (HR = 3.51; 95% confidence interval: 1.58-7.78; P = 0.002). HCV titer levels remained unchanged, negating any sorafenib impact onto HCV titer levels. Although an overall negative phase III study, patients treated with doxorubicin plus sorafenib and sorafenib only, on CALGB 80802 had worse PFS if HCV-UN. Higher levels of HCV titers at baseline were associated with significantly improved PFS. SIGNIFICANCE: Sorafenib therapy for HCC may impact HCV replication and viral gene expression. In HCV-positive patients accrued to CLAGB 80802 phase III study evaluating the addition of doxorubicin to sorafenib, HCV titer levels were evaluated at baseline and different timepoints. Sorafenib did not impact HCV titer levels.

154,Preoperative dexamethasone administration in hepatectomy of 25-min intermittent Pringle's maneuver for hepatocellular carcinoma: a randomized controlled trial.,Huang Y; Xu L; Wang N; Wei Y; Wang W; Xu M; Jiang L,"BACKGROUND: A previous randomized controlled trial demonstrated that intermittent Pringle's maneuver (IPM) with a 25-min ischemic interval could be applied safely and efficiently in hepatectomy for patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). But prolonging the hepatic inflow clamping time will inevitably aggravate the ischemia-reperfusion injury. Therefore, we aimed to evaluate the effect of prophylactic dexamethasone on alleviating surgical stress for HCC patients with a 25-min ischemic interval. METHODS: From December 2022 to April 2023, patients who met the inclusion criteria were randomly assigned to the dexamethasone group or control group. Perioperative data and short-term survival outcomes between the two groups were recorded and compared, and subgroup analysis was performed. RESULTS: Two hundred and seventy patients were allocated to the dexamethasone group ( n =135) and control group ( n =135). Patients in the dexamethasone group had lower area under the curve of serial alanine aminotransferase (AUC ALT ) ( P =0.043) and aspartate aminotransferase (AUC AST ) ( P =0.009), total bilirubin (TB) ( P =0.018), procalcitonin (PCT) ( P =0.012), interleukin-6 (IL-6) ( P =0.006), incidence of major complication ( P =0.031) and shorter postoperative hospital stay ( P =0.046) than those in the control group. Subgroup analysis showed that the dexamethasone group experienced milder hepatocellular injury than the control group for patients with cirrhosis, and for patients without cirrhosis, the dexamethasone group experienced milder inflammatory response. Moreover, the dexamethasone group preserved better liver function and experienced milder inflammatory response for patients undergoing major hepatectomy, although the hepatocellular injury was not significantly improved.

155,Radiotherapy is superior to transarterial chemoembolization as adjuvant therapy after narrow-margin hepatectomy in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma: A single-center prospective randomized study.,Bai T; Tang ZH; Wang XB; Chen J; Ye JZ; Lu SL; Wei M; Wu FX; Li LQ,"BACKGROUND: This study was recruited to compare the efficacy and safety of radiotherapy (RT) and transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) as postoperative adjuvant therapy after narrow-margin hepatectomy in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients. METHODS: This single-center prospective randomized study was conducted in the Cancer Hospital, Guang Xi Medical University, Nanning. A total of 72 patients who received treatment in this hospital between August 2017 and July 2019 were included and randomly allocated to TACE group (n = 48) and RT group (n = 24). Next, overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) rates, recurrence patterns, financial burden, and safety were evaluated. RESULTS: The difference between the RT and TACE groups was not significant in one-, three-, and five-year OS (87.5%, 79.0%, and 62.5% vs. 93.8%, 75.9%, and 63.4%, respectively, P = 0.071) and PFS rates (79.0%, 54.2%, and 22.6% vs. 75.0%, 47.9%, and 32.6%, respectively, P = 0.071). Compared to the TACE group, the RT group had significantly lower intrahepatic recurrence rate (20.8% vs. 52.1%, P = 0.011), higher extrahepatic recurrence rate (37.5% vs. 14.6%, P = 0.034), and no marginal and diffuse recurrences (0% vs. 16.7%, P < 0.05). The mean overall treatment cost was higher (¥62,550.59 ± 4397.27 vs. ¥40,732.56 ± 9210.54, P < 0.01), the hospital stay (15.1 ± 3.7 vs. 11.8 ± 4.1 days, P < 0.01) was longer, and the overall treatment stay (13.3 ± 5.3 vs. 41.29 ± 12.4 days, P < 0.01) was shorter in the TACE group than in the RT group. Besides, both groups did not exhibit significant differences in the frequency and severity of adverse events. CONCLUSION: Both adjuvant TACE and RT can better the OS and PFS of patients with HCC. However, RT has a significantly better performance than TACE in terms of improving intrahepatic recurrence rate, treatment cost and hospital stay. part of Springer Nature.",False,"Population and outcomes match, but interventions are not immunotherapy or targeted therapy.",HCC patients post-narrow-margin hepatectomy,radiotherapy vs. TACE,TACE,overall survival and progression-free survival,prospective randomized study,False,Population and outcomes match but interventions are not immunotherapy or targeted therapy.,-,-,-,-,-,,No disagreement between Model A and B,False
156,Global disparities in mortality and liver transplantation in hospitalised patients with cirrhosis: a prospective cohort study for the CLEARED Consortium.,Bajaj JS; Choudhury AK; Xie Q; Kamath PS; Topazian M; Hayes PC; Torre A; Desalegn H; Idilman R; Cao Z; Alvares-da-Silva MR; George J; Bush BJ; Thacker LR; Wong F,"BACKGROUND: Cirrhosis, the end result of liver injury, has high mortality globally. The effect of country-level income on mortality from cirrhosis is unclear. We aimed to assess predictors of death in inpatients with cirrhosis using a global consortium focusing on cirrhosis-related and access-related variables. METHODS: In this prospective observational cohort study, the CLEARED Consortium followed up inpatients with cirrhosis at 90 tertiary care hospitals in 25 countries across six continents. Consecutive patients older than 18 years who were admitted non-electively, without COVID-19 or advanced hepatocellular carcinoma, were enrolled. We ensured equitable participation by limiting enrolment to a maximum of 50 patients per site. Data were collected from patients and their medical records, and included demographic characteristics; country; disease severity (MELD-Na score); cirrhosis cause; medications used; reasons for admission; transplantation listing; cirrhosis-related history in the past 6 months; and clinical course and management while hospitalised and for 30 days post discharge. Primary outcomes were death and receipt of liver transplant during index hospitalisation or within 30 days post discharge. Sites were surveyed regarding availability of and access to diagnostic and treatment services. Outcomes were compared by country income level of participating sites, defined according to World Bank income classifications (high-income countries [HICs], upper-middle-income countries [UMICs], and low-income or lower-middle-income countries [LICs or LMICs]). Multivariable models controlling for demographic variables, disease cause, and disease severity were used to analyse the odds of each outcome associated with variables of interest. FINDINGS: Patients were recruited between Nov 5, 2021, and Aug 31, 2022. Complete inpatient data were obtained for 3884 patients (mean age 55·9 years [SD 13·3]; 2493 (64·2%) men and 1391 (35·8%) women; 1413 [36·4%] from HICs, 1757 [45·2%] from UMICs, and 714 [18·4%] from LICs or LMICs), with 410 lost to follow-up within 30 days after hospital discharge. The number of patients who died while hospitalised was 110 (7·8%) of 1413 in HICs, 182 (10·4%) of 1757 in UMICs, and 158 (22·1%) of 714 in LICs and LMICs (p<0·0001), and within 30 days post discharge these values were 179 (14·4%) of 1244 in HICs, 267 (17·2%) of 1556 in UMICs, and 204 (30·3%) of 674 in LICs and LMICs (p<0·0001). Compared with patients from HICs, increased risk of death during hospitalisation was found for patients from UMICs (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 2·14 [95% CI 1·61-2·84]) and from LICs or LMICs (2·54 [1·82-3·54]), in addition to increased risk of death within 30 days post discharge (1·95 [1·44-2·65] in UMICs and 1·84 [1·24-2·72] in LICs or LMICs). Receipt of a liver transplant was recorded in 59 (4·2%) of 1413 patients from HICs, 28 (1·6%) of 1757 from UMICs (aOR 0·41 [95% CI 0·24-0·69] vs HICs), and 14 (2·0%) of 714 from LICs and LMICs (0·21 [0·10-0·41] vs HICs) during index hospitalisation (p<0·0001), and in 105 (9·2%) of 1137 patients from HICs, 55 (4·0%) of 1372 from UMICs (0·58 [0·39-0·85] vs HICs), and 16 (3·1%) of 509 from LICs or LMICs (0·21 [0·11-0·40] vs HICs) by 30 days post discharge (p<0·0001). Site survey results showed that access to important medications (rifaximin, albumin, and terlipressin) and interventions (emergency endoscopy, liver transplantation, intensive care, and palliative care) varied geographically. INTERPRETATION: Inpatients with cirrhosis in LICs, LMICs, or UMICs have significantly higher mortality than inpatients in HICs independent of medical risk factors, and this might be due to disparities in access to essential diagnostic and treatment services. These results should encourage researchers and policy makers to consider access to services and medications when evaluating cirrhosis-related outcomes.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Consecutive patients with MVI-negative HCC who underwent preoperative Gd-EOB-DTPA MRI between January 2015 and December 2019 were retrospectively enrolled.In total, 122 patients were randomly assigned to the training and validation groups at a ratio of 7:3. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were performed to identify significant clinical parameters and MRI features, including quantitative and qualitative parameters associated with prognosis, which were incorporated into a predictive nomogram. The end-point of this study was recurrence-free survival. Outcomes were compared between groups using the Kaplan-Meier method with the log-rank test. RESULTS: During a median follow-up period of 58.86 months, 38 patients (31.15 %) experienced recurrence. Multivariate analysis revealed that lower relative enhancement ratio (RER), hepatobiliary phase hypointensity without arterial phase hyperenhancement, Liver Imaging Reporting and Data System category, mild-moderate T2 hyperintensity, and higher aspartate aminotransferase levels were risk factors associated with prognosis and then incorporated into the prognostic model. C-indices for training and validation groups were 0.732 and 0.692, respectively. The most appropriate cut-off value for RER was 1.197. Patients with RER ≤ 1.197 had significantly higher postoperative recurrence rates than those with RER > 1.197 (p = 0.004).

This study aimed to assess the efficacy and safety of atezolizumab plus bevacizumab and to investigate predictors of progression-free survival and overall survival. Patients with unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma treated with atezolizumab plus bevacizumab therapy in 19 hospitals were enrolled before treatment and observed prospectively. The outcomes of 222 patients in this cohort were analyzed. The objective response rate and disease control rate were 22.0% and 70.6%, respectively, whereas the median progression-free survival was 5.7 months. Independent risk factors for shortened progression-free survival were younger age (<75 years; 3.9 months vs. 8.6 months), higher number of intrahepatic tumors (≥5; 4.0 months vs. 7.9 months), macrovascular invasion (2.3 months vs. 6.7 months), and higher neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (≥3.03; 3.0 months vs. 7.8 months). The median overall survival was not reached; however, independent risk factors for shortened overall survival were absence of hyperlipidemia, higher number of intrahepatic tumors (≥5), macrovascular invasion, higher α-fetoprotein level (≥400 ng/mL), worse Child-Pugh score (≥6), and higher neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (≥3.03). Severe adverse events (grade ≥3) were observed in 96 patients (36.0%), with proteinuria being the most frequent. In conclusion, patients with older age, lower number of intrahepatic tumors, absent macrovascular invasion, and lower neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio are expected to have better progression-free survival with atezolizumab plus bevacizumab therapy for unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma. terms of the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original author and source are credited.",False,"Population and intervention match, but no comparison to standard therapy or placebo, and study design is not a randomized controlled trial.",patients with unresectable HCC,atezolizumab plus bevacizumab,not specified,progression-free survival and overall survival,prospective observational study,False,Population and intervention match but no comparison to standard therapy or placebo.

160,"Neoadjuvant therapy of sequential TACE, camrelizumab, and apatinib for single huge hepatocellular carcinoma (NEO-START): study protocol for a randomized controlled trial.",Hao Y; Xie F; Zhou Y; Li C; Zhang X; Shen J; Yao M; Sun X; Zhou J; Wen T; Peng W,"BACKGROUND: The high recurrence rate after liver resection emphasizes the urgent need for neoadjuvant therapy in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) to enhance the overall prognosis for patients. Immune checkpoint inhibitors, camrelizumab combined with an anti-angiogenic tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) apatinib, have emerged as a first-line treatment option for patients with unresectable HCC, yet its neoadjuvant application in combination with transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) in HCC remains unexplored. Therefore, this study aims to investigate the efficacy and safety of sequential TACE, camrelizumab, and apatinib as a neoadjuvant therapy for single, huge HCC. METHODS: This multi-center, open-label randomized phase 3 trial will be conducted at 7 tertiary hospitals. Patients with single huge (≥ 10 cm in diameter), resectable HCC will be randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to arm of surgery alone or arm of neoadjuvant therapy followed by surgery. In the neoadjuvant therapy group, patients will receive TACE within 1 week after randomization, followed by camrelizumab (200 mg q2w, 4 cycles), along with apatinib (250 mg qd, 2 months). Patients will receive liver resection after neoadjuvant therapy unless the disease is assessed as progressive. The primary outcome is recurrence-free survival (RFS) at 1 year. The planned sample size of 60 patients will be calculated to permit the accumulation of sufficient RFS events in 1 year to achieve 80% power for the RFS primary endpoint. DISCUSSION: Synergistic effects provided by multimodality therapy of locoregional treatment, TKI, and anti-programmed cell death 1 inhibitor significantly improved overall survival for patients with unresectable HCC.

METHODS AND MATERIALS: Patients were included if they were eligible for TACE. They could also be recruited if they required treatment prior to liver transplantation. A maximum of four TACE-DEB procedures and ablation after incomplete TACE-DEB were both allowed. SBRT was delivered in six fractions of 8-9Gy. Primary end point was time to progression (TTP). Secondary endpoints were local control (LC), overall survival (OS), response rate (RR), toxicity, and quality of life (QoL). The calculated sample size was 100 patients. RESULTS: Between May 2015 and April 2020, 30 patients were randomized to the study. Due to slow accrual the trial was closed prematurely. Two patients in the SBRT arm were considered ineligible leaving 16 patients in the TACE-DEB arm and 12 in the SBRT arm. Median follow-up was 28.1 months. Median TTP was 12 months for TACEDEB and 19 months for SBRT (p=0.15). Median LC was 12 months for TACE-DEB and >40 months (not reached) for SBRT (p=0.075). Median OS was 36.8 months for TACEDEB and 44.1 months for SBRT (p=0.36). A post-hoc analysis showed 100% for SBRT 1- and 2-year LC, and 54.4% and 43.6% for TACE-DEB (p=0.019). Both treatments resulted in RR>80%. Three episodes of possibly related toxicity grade ≥3 were observed after TACE-DEB. No episodes were observed after SBRT. QoL remained stable after both treatment arms. CONCLUSIONS: In this trial, TTP after TACE-DEB was not significantly improved by SBRT, while SBRT showed higher local antitumoral activity than TACE-DEB, without detrimental effects on OS, toxicity and QoL.

The long-term survival outcomes and safety of partial hepatectomy versus interventional treatment using ablation with or without pre-ablation transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) in patients with HBV-related HCC within the Milan criteria and with clinically significant PHT were compared in this study. METHODS: This open-label randomized clinical trial was conducted on consecutive patients with clinically PHT and hepatitis B virus (HBV)-related HCC with tumors which were within the Milan criteria. These patients were randomized 1:1 to receive either partial hepatectomy or interventional treatment between December 2012 and June 2018. The primary endpoint was overall survival (OS); secondary endpoints included recurrence-free survival (RFS) and therapeutic safety. RESULTS: Each of the 2 groups had 80 patients. The 1-, 3- and 5-year OS rates in the partial hepatectomy group and the interventional treatment group were 95.0%, 86.2%, 69.5% versus 93.8%, 77.5%, 64.9%, respectively (P = 0.325). The corresponding RFS rates were 78.8%, 55.0%, 46.2% versus 71.3%, 52.5%, 45.0%, respectively (P = 0.783). The partial hepatectomy group had a higher complication rate compared to the interventional group (67.5% vs. 20%, P < 0.001). However, the differences were mainly in Clavien-Dindo Grade I complications (P < 0.001), while not significant in Grade II/III/IV/V (All P > 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: This study shows that partial hepatectomy treatment did not meet prespecified significance for improved OS and RFS compared to interventional treatment for patients with HBV-related HCC within the Milan criteria and with clinically significant PHT.

METHODS: This phase IV, prospective randomized trial enrolled cancer patients with CHB from 2014 to 2019 in Taiwan. Included patients were randomized to receive either 24- (Arm A) or 48-week (Arm B) post-chemotherapy TDF and compared for cumulative incidence of virological and clinical relapse. Logistic regressions were conducted to determine the factors associated with HBV relapse. RESULTS: One hundred patients were randomized, and 41 patients in Arm A and 46 in Arm B completed the TDF treatment. No significant difference was found in cumulative incidence of virological relapse (Arm A: 94.4%, Arm B: 93.1%, p = 0.110) or clinical relapse among patients with baseline HBV DNA > 2000 IU/mL (Arm A: 38.9%, Arm B: 26.7%, p = 0.420) between the two arms. High baseline HBV DNA ≥ 10,000 IU/mL (OR = 51.22) and HBsAg ≥ 1000 IU/mL (OR = 8.64) were independently associated with an increased virological relapse. Alanine aminotransferase (ALT), serum phosphorus, vitamin D, and estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) remained stable throughout the study. CONCLUSIONS: The 24-week preventative TDF has comparable efficacy to the 48-week treatment in virologic and clinical relapse. High baseline HBsAg or HBV DNA is associated with a higher risk of HBV relapse. These findings imply a 24-week duration of TDF treatment with a close monitor for patients with a high baseline viral load. Hepatitis B virus infection is a prominent cause of liver cancer and chronic liver disease and affected millions of people worldwide. When HBV-infected people are exposed to immunosuppressive medication or chemotherapy for cancer, the chance of HBV reactivation rises considerably.

The role of neoadjuvant radiotherapy (RT) in treating patients with an early-stage HCC predicted to have high risks of MVI remains to be explored. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Consecutive patients with a resectable single and small (≤5 cm) hepatitis B virus-related HCC predicted to have high risks of MVI were randomized 1:1 to receive either neoadjuvant intensity modulated radiation therapy (18 Gy with fractionated doses of 3 Gy) followed by surgery 4 weeks later or upfront surgery. The primary endpoint was disease-free survival (DFS). The secondary outcomes included overall survival (OS), objective response rate, RT-related toxicity and surgical complications. RESULTS: There were 30 patients randomized to each of the two groups. In the neoadjuvant RT group, three patients violated the study protocol, with two having upfront hepatectomy and one radiofrequency ablation after RT. The objective response rate after RT was 25.0% (7/28), but 2 patients suffered from grade 3 liver toxicity. The median follow-up was 68 months (interquartile range, 58-70 months) in the neoadjuvant RT group, and 68 months (interquartile range, 62-75 months) in the upfront surgery group. On intention-to-treat analysis, the median DFS and median OS were not reached in both the 2 arms. The 1-year, 2-year, 3-year and 5-year DFS rates for the neoadjuvant RT group were 86.7%, 76.7%, 60.0% and 56.3%, versus 90.0%, 66.7%, 52.8% and 45.7% in the upfront surgery group ( P =0.448), respectively.

However, it has limited effect on fibrosis resolution in patients with CHB, particularly in preventing progression to hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Ruangan granule (RG), a Chinese herbal formula, has proven to produce a therapeutic effect against liver fibrosis in animal experiment. Thus, we aimed to evaluate the effect of our Chinese herbal formula (RG) combined with entecavir (ETV) to reverse advanced liver fibrosis/early cirrhosis from CHB. METHODS: A total of 240 CHB patients with histologically confirmed advanced liver fibrosis/early cirrhosis from 12 centers were randomly and blindly allocated to consume either ETV (0.5 mg/day) plus RG (2 times/day) or control (ETV) for 48 weeks (wk) treatment. Changes in histopathology, serology and imageology were observed. Liver fibrosis reversion, defined as a reduction in the Knodell HAI score by ≥ 2 points and Ishak score by ≥ 1 grade, was assessed. RESULTS: The rate of fibrosis regression and inflammation remission after 48 wk of treatment in histopathology was significantly higher in the ETV + RG group (38.73% vs. 23.94%, P = 0.031). The ultrasonic semiquantitative scores decreased by ≥ 2 points and were 41 (28.87%) and 15 (21.13%) in the ETV+RG and ETV groups, respectively (P = 0.026). The ETV+RG group had a significantly lower Fibrosis-4 score (FIB-4) index (P = 0.028). There was a significant difference between the ETV+RG and ETV groups in the liver function normalization rate (P < 0.01). Moreover, ETV plus RG combination treatment further reduced the risk of HCC in median 55-month follow-up (P < 0.01).

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Clinical data of HCC patients who underwent hepatectomy at four medical centers were retrospectively analyzed, including those who received PA-TACE and those who did not. These two categories of patients were randomly allocated to the development and validation cohorts in a 7:3 ratio. RESULTS: A total of 1505 HCC patients who underwent hepatectomy were included in this study, comprising 723 patients who did not receive PA-TACE and 782 patients who received PA-TACE. Among them, patients who received PA-TACE experienced more adverse events, although these events were mild and manageable (Grade 1-2, all p < 0.05). Nomograms were constructed and validated for patients with and without PA-TACE using independent predictors that influenced disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS). These two nomograms had C-indices greater than 0.800 in the development cohort and exhibited good calibration and discrimination ability compared to six conventional HCC staging systems. Patients in the intermediate-to-high-risk group in the nomogram who received PA-TACE had higher DFS and OS (all p < 0.05). In addition, tumor recurrence was significantly controlled in the intermediate-to-high-risk group of patients who received PA-TACE, while there was no significant difference in the low-risk group of patients who received PA-TACE.

Results of a cohort of patients with various solid tumors with germline or somatic BRCA1/2 mutations treated with talazoparib are reported. METHODS: Eligible patients had advanced solid tumors, measurable disease (RECIST), Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status 0-2, adequate organ function, and no standard treatment options. Patients with germline BRCA-mutated human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-negative locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer were not eligible for this study. Primary end point was disease control (DC) determined by investigator assessment of objective response (OR) or stable disease (SD) of at least 16 weeks duration (SD16+). The results were evaluated on the basis of a one-sided exact binomial test with a null DC rate of 15% versus 35% (power = 0.82; α = .10). Secondary end points were OR, progression-free survival, overall survival, duration of response, duration of SD, and safety. RESULTS: Twenty-eight patients (20 cancer types) with BRCA1/2 mutations were enrolled from December 2019 to September 2021 and collapsed into a single histology pooled cohort for analysis. All patients were evaluable for efficacy. One complete response, nine partial response, and six SD16+ were observed for DC and OR rates of 57% (one-sided 90% CI, 43 to 100) and 36% (95% CI, 19 to 56), respectively. The null hypothesis of a 15% DC rate was rejected (P < .001).

169,mhealth-based interventions to improving liver cancer screening among high-risk populations: a study protocol for a randomized controlled trial.,Feng GH; Zhao KH; Wang YF; Yue QQ; Chen YS; Huang LL; Meng XR; Peng T; Zeng Y,"BACKGROUND: Liver cancer (LC) screening, such as AFP test and abdominal ultrasound, is an effective way to prevent LC, one of the most common cancers worldwide. Despite the proven screening benefits, screening participation among high-risk populations for LC remains low. This suggests that targeted, systematic, and effective interventions should be provided to improve knowledge and awareness related to LC screening, enhance screening intentions, and thereby promote screening behaviors. Telephone is people's main medium of daily communication and mHealth-based programs offer a potential and effective solution for promoting health behaviors. The purpose of this study is to develop and implement a mHealth (WeChat app) based intervention guided by Fogg's Behavior Model (FBM) to augment the knowledge of LC prevention among people at risk of LC and enhance their motivation for screening, and to validate its effectiveness in improving LC screening. METHODS: We propose a two-arm, single-blind randomized controlled trial with 82 at-risk individuals of LC, delivering a 6-month mHealth-based intervention program with optional health counseling. Recruitment will be through tertiary hospitals and community organizations in 4 districts in Heng Yang. In total, 82 individuals at high risk for HCC will be randomized 1:1 to intervention or control (usual care) groups. The intervention group will receive intervention, whose contents are based on the FBM model, via multiple forms of media including PowerPoint presentation, multimedia video, health information booklet and screening message, which is delivered in the WeChat Applet. Control dyads will be provided with usual health education. Outcomes will be assessed at baseline and post-intervention. DISCUSSION: The findings of this study will provide evidence of the benefits of utilizing mHealth-based approaches in intervention development to enhance the effectiveness of screening adherence for high-risk people of LC. Further, the findings would provide reference to the potential incorporation of the targeted intervention in local community organizations.

This observational study used real-world data to assess these regimens' safety in eligible patients and develop an algorithm to identify patients suitable for simplified treatment by non-specialists. METHODS: 7,677 HCV-infected patients from Taiwan Hepatitis C Registry (TACR) who received at least one dose of sofosbuvir/velpatasvir or glecaprevir/pibrentasvir, and fulfilled the EASL/AASLD-IDSA criteria for simplified treatment were analyzed. Multivariate analysis was conducted on patient characteristics and safety data. RESULTS: Overall, 92.8% (7,128/7,677) of patients achieved sustained virological response and only 1.9% (146/7,677) experienced Grades 2-4 laboratory abnormalities in key liver function parameters (alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, and total bilirubin), with only 18 patients (0.23%) experiencing Grades 3-4 abnormalities. Age > 70 years old, presence of hepatocellular carcinoma, total bilirubin > 1.2 mg/dL, estimated glomerular filtration rate < 60 mL/min/1.73 m(2), and Fibrosis-4 > 3.25 were associated with higher risks of Grades 2-4 abnormalities.

We investigated preoperative drug-eluting bead transarterial chemoembolization (DEB-TACE) plus sintilimab, in this setting. APPROACH AND RESULTS: In this prospective, phase II study (NCT04174781), adults with HCC of BCLC stage A exceeding the Milan criteria, or BCLC stage B, and ineligible for surgical resection, received sintilimab 200 mg and DEB-TACE. The primary endpoint was progression-free survival by modified RECIST. Secondary endpoints included objective response rate, pathologic response rate, and safety. At the data cutoff (July 2022), among 60 patients, the objective response rate was 62% (37/60) and 51 patients had undergone surgery. After a median follow-up of 26.0 months (range, 3.4-31.8), the median progression-free survival was 30.5 months (95% CI: 16.1-not reached). Among patients undergoing surgery, median progression-free survival was not reached and the 12-month progression-free survival rate was 76% (95% CI: 67-91). A pathologic complete response was achieved in 14% (7/51) of these patients. All patients experienced at least one adverse event, but these were generally manageable.

However, whether DEB-TACE is superior to conventional TACE (cTACE) remains unclear. OBJECTIVE: This randomized controlled trial aimed to compare the efficacy and safety of DEB-TACE versus cTACE in treating HCC with PVTT. METHODS: The study was conducted at a tertiary care center in Southeast China. HCC patients with PVTT were randomized at a 1:1 ratio into the DEB-TACE or cTACE groups. The primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS), and the secondary endpoints were overall survival (OS) and the incidence of adverse events (AEs). An independent review committee assessed the radiologic response according to the modified Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (mRECIST). AEs were assessed by the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 4.0. Systemic therapies were not restricted. RESULTS: Between September 2018 and July 2020, 163 patients were randomized to undergo DEB-TACE ( n =82) or cTACE ( n =81). Nine patients were excluded, and 154 patients were included in the final analysis; the median age was 55 years (range, 24-78 years), and 140 (90.9%) were male. The median PFS in the DEB-TACE group was 6.0 months (95% CI, 5.0-10.0) versus 4.0 months (95% CI, 3.0-5.0) in the cTACE group (hazard ratio, 0.63; 95% CI, 0.42-0.95; P =0.027). The DEB-TACE group showed a higher response rate [51 (66.2%) vs. 36 (46.8%); P =0.0015] and a longer median OS [12.0 months (95% CI, 9.0-16.0) vs. 8.0 months (95% CI, 7.0-11.0), P =0.039] than the cTACE group. Multivariate analysis showed that the treatment group, ALBI score, distant metastasis and additional TKIs were the four independent prognostic factors correlated with PFS. In addition, the treatment group, PVTT group and combination with surgery were independently associated with OS. AEs were similar in the two groups, and postembolization syndrome was the most frequent AE. CONCLUSION: DEB-TACE is superior to cTACE in treating HCC patients with PVTT, demonstrating improved PFS and OS with an acceptable safety profile, and may thus emerge as a promising treatment strategy for HCC patients with PVTT.

The present study aimed to develop and assess the performance of predictive models by using a combination of presurgical circulating tumor cell (CTCs) data and clinicopathological features to screen patients at high risk of EHR to achieve precise decision-making. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 227 patients with recurrent HCC and preoperative CTC data from January 2014 to August 2019 were enrolled. All patients were randomly assigned to one of two cohorts: development or validation. Two preoperative and postoperative nomogram models for EHR prediction were developed and multi-dimensionally validated. RESULTS: Patients with EHR had generally lower recurrence-free survival (p < 0.001), and overall survival (p < 0.001), and significantly higher CTC counts (epithelial CTCs, epithelial/mesenchymal hybrid CTCs, and mesenchymal CTCs count, all p < 0.05) than those without EHR. Univariate and multivariate analyses revealed that EHR was associated with four risk factors in the development cohort: total CTC count (p = 0.014), tumor size (p = 0.028), node number (p = 0.045), and microvascular invasion (p = 0.035). These factors were incorporated into two nomogram models (preoperative and postoperative), which reliably predicted EHR through multidimensional verification (e.g., calibration plot, receiver operating characteristic analysis, decision curve analysis, and clinical impact curve analysis) in the development and validation cohorts, respectively. With threshold of scores of 100.3 and 176.8 before and after surgery respectively, both nomograms were able to stratify patients into two distinct prognostic subgroups (all p < 0.05).

BACKGROUND: LLR has an increased risk of gas embolism. Although animal studies have shown that low PP reduces the occurrence of gas embolism, clinical evidence is lacking. METHODS: This parallel, dual-arm, double-blind, randomized controlled trial included 141 patients undergoing elective LLR. Patients were randomized into standard (""S,"" 15 mm Hg; n = 70) or low (""L,"" 10 mm Hg; n = 71) PP groups. Severe gas embolism (≥ grade 3, based on the Schmandra microbubble method) was detected using transesophageal echocardiography and recorded as the primary outcome. Intraoperative vital signs and postoperative recovery profiles were also evaluated. RESULTS: Fewer severe gas embolism cases (n = 29, 40.8% vs n = 47, 67.1%, P = 0.003), fewer abrupt decreases in end-tidal carbon dioxide partial pressure, shorter severe gas embolism duration, less peripheral oxygen saturation reduction, and fewer increases in heart rate and lactate during gas embolization episodes was found in group L than in group S. Moreover, a higher arterial partial pressure of oxygen and peripheral oxygen saturation were observed, and fewer fluids and vasoactive drugs were administered in group L than in group S. In both groups, the distensibility index of the inferior vena cava negatively correlated with central venous pressure throughout LLR, and a comparable quality of recovery was observed.

METHODS: Patients with a single HCC ≤ 5 cm and accepting CEUS and EOB-MRI before surgery were enrolled in this study. Totally, 85 patients were randomly divided into the training and validation cohorts in a ratio of 7:3. Non-radiomics imaging features, the CEUS and EOB-MRI radiomics scores were extracted from the arterial phase, portal phase and delayed phase images of CEUS and the hepatobiliary phase images of EOB-MRI. Different MVI predicting models based on CEUS and EOB-MRI were constructed and their predictive values were evaluated. RESULTS: Since univariate analysis revealed that arterial peritumoral enhancement on the CEUS image, CEUS radiomics score, and EOB-MRI radiomics score were significantly associated with MVI, three prediction models, namely the CEUS model, the EOB-MRI model, and the CEUS-EOB model, were developed. In the validation cohort, the areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve of the CEUS model, the EOB-MRI model, and the CEUS-EOB model were 0.73, 0.79, and 0.86, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Radiomics scores based on CEUS and EOB-MRI, combined with arterial peritumoral enhancement on CEUS, show a satisfying performance of MVI predicting.

Between November 2015 and March 2017, with follow-up until mid 2019, treatment-naïve patients with HCV without decompensated cirrhosis or liver cancer were recruited to receive 12 week-treatment with either sofosbuvir + ribavirin (HCV genotype 2) or sofosbuvir + ledipasvir (genotype 1 or 4) and retreatment with sofosbuvir + velpatasvir + voxilaprevir in case of virological failure. The primary outcome was sustained virological response at 12 weeks after end of treatment (SVR12). Secondary outcomes included treatment adherence, safety and SVR12 in patients who were retreated due to non-response to first-line treatment. The model of care relied on both viral load assessment and educational sessions to increase patient awareness, adherence and health literacy. The study recruited 120 participants, 36 HIV-co-infected, and 14 cirrhotic. Only one patient discontinued treatment because of return to home country. Neither death nor severe adverse event occurred. SVR12 was reached in 107 patients (89%): (90%) in genotype 1 or 2, and 88% in GT-4. All retreated patients (n = 13) reached SVR12.

Historically, immune-based approaches have been ineffective. VB-111 (ofranergene obadenovec) is a genetically-modified adenoviral vector targeting the TME; its unique dual mechanism induces an immune response and disrupts neovascularization. Checkpoint inhibition may synergize the immune response induced by viral-mediated anti-angiogenic gene therapy. We aimed to examine the safety and antitumor activity of VB-111 and nivolumab in patients with refractory MSS CLM and to characterize immunological treatment-response. METHODS: This was a phase II study of adult patients with histologically-confirmed MSS CLM who progressed on prior therapy. A priming dose of VB-111 1×10(13) viral particles was given intravenously 2 weeks prior to starting biweekly nivolumab 240 mg and continued every 6 weeks. The combination continued until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. The primary objectives were overall response rate and safety/tolerability. Secondary objectives included median overall survival and progression-free survival. Correlative studies were performed on paired tumor biopsies and blood. RESULTS: Between August 2020 and December 2021, 14 patients were enrolled with median age 50.5 years (40-75), and 14% were women. Median follow-up was 5.5 months. Of the 10 evaluable patients, the combination of VB-111 and nivolumab failed to demonstrate radiographic responses; at best, 2 patients had stable disease. Median overall survival was 5.5 months (95% CI: 2.3 to 10.8), and median progression-free survival was 1.8 months (95% CI: 1.4 to 1.9). The most common grade 3-4 treatment-related adverse events were fever/chills, influenza-like symptoms, and lymphopenia. No treatment-related deaths were reported. Qualitative analysis of immunohistochemical staining of paired tumor biopsies did not demonstrate significant immune infiltration after treatment, except for one patient who had exceptional survival (26.0 months). Immune analysis of peripheral blood mononuclear cells showed an increase of PD-1(high)Ki67(high)CD8(+) T cells and HLA-DR(high) T cells after VB-111 priming dose. Plasma cytokines interleukin-10 and tumor necrosis factor-α increased after treatment with both drugs. CONCLUSION: In patients with MSS CLM, VB-111 and nivolumab did not improve overall response rate or survival but were tolerated with minimal toxicities. While challenging to distinguish between antiviral or antitumor, correlative studies demonstrated an immune response with activation and proliferation of CD8(+) T cells systemically that was poorly sustained.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: In the multicenter, two-stage, and randomized phase 1/2 trial, patients were randomly assigned to receive toripalimab alone (240 mg, every 3 weeks), subtotal local ablation followed by toripalimab starting on post-ablation day 3 (Schedule D3), or on post-ablation day 14 (Schedule D14). The first endpoint of stage 1 was to determine which combination schedule could continue and progression-free survival (PFS) as the primary endpoint for stage 1/2. RESULTS: A total of 146 patients were recruited. During stage 1, Schedule D3 achieved numerically higher objective response rate (ORR) than Schedule D14 for non-ablation lesions (37.5% vs. 31.3%), and was chosen for stage 2 evaluation. For the entire cohort of both stages, patients with Schedule D3 had a significantly higher ORR than with toripalimab alone (33.8% vs. 16.9%; P = 0.027). Moreover, patients with Schedule D3 had improved median PFS (7.1 vs. 3.8 months; P < 0.001) and median overall survival (18.4 vs. 13.2 months; P = 0.005), as compared with toripalimab alone.

We aimed to examine the impact of telehealth consultations on HCC surveillance rates within a specialist liver clinic. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective observational study within an Australian outreach liver clinic within a culturally diverse community, comparing standard consultations before the COVID-19 pandemic to telehealth consultations during the pandemic. The primary outcome was surveillance uptake defined as the percentage of time up-to-date with surveillance (PTUDS) with the 6-month interval following each scan considered up-to-date. RESULTS: Over 18 months of follow-up for each cohort, the median PTUDS was 86.5% in the standard consultation cohort and 85.5% in the telehealth consultation cohort (p = 0.12). HCC diagnoses did not differ between groups and hospitalisation and mortality rates were low. Using multivariate regression, increasing age, the need for an interpreter and being born in South-East Asia independently predicted PTUDS in the standard consultation cohort, whereas being born in Australia or New Zealand was predictive of a lower PTUDS. Current alcohol use and distance from the clinic predicted a lower PTUDS in the telehealth consultation cohort. In both groups, missed clinic attendances were strongly predictive of a lower PTUDS. CONCLUSION: Telehealth hepatology consultations effectively coordinate HCC surveillance and are associated with similar outcomes to standard consultations.

NAFLD can progress to non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), fibrosis, cirrhosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). This study aimed to assess the efficacy of probiotic (lactobacillus) supplementation on NAFLD fibrosis score. METHODOLOGY: A double-arm randomized controlled trial was conducted in the family medicine clinic of a tertiary hospital, enrolling patients with sonographic evidence of NAFLD. Fifty patients were divided into two groups: the Probiotic group received lifestyle modification instructions along with daily probiotic supplementation for twelve weeks, with regular monthly follow-up visits. The Standard Treatment group received low-fat diet and lifestyle modification instructions only. RESULTS: The mean age of participants was 46.10 years (SD 10.11), with 70% females and 30% males. The study found a statistically significant difference in liver enzymes (ALT and AST) and BMI in the probiotic group before and after intervention. However, there was no significant difference in NAFLD fibrosis score between the two groups. CONCLUSION: Short-term probiotic treatment resulted in improvements in ALT, AST, and BMI in the probiotic group, but did not significantly affect NAFLD fibrosis score.

CSPH is defined by hepatic venous pressure gradient (HVPG)≥10 mm Hg; however, the HVPG measurement is not widely adopted due to its invasiveness. Liver stiffness (LS)≥25 kPa can be used as a surrogate of HVPG≥10 mm Hg to rule in CSPH with 90% of the positive predicting value in majority aetiologies of patients. A compelling argument is existing for using LS≥25 kPa to diagnose CSPH and then to initiate carvedilol in patients with compensated cirrhosis, and about 5%-6% of patients under this diagnosis criteria may not be benefited from carvedilol and are at risk of lower heart rate and mean arterial pressure. Randomised controlled trial on the use of carvedilol to prevent liver decompensation in CSPH diagnosed by LS remains to elucidate. Therefore, we aimed to investigate if compensated cirrhosis patients with LS≥25 kPa may benefit from carvedilol therapy. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: This study is a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicentre trial. We will randomly assign 446 adult compensated cirrhosis patients with LS≥25 kPa and without any previous decompensated event and without high-risk gastro-oesophageal varices. Patients are randomly divided into two groups, with 223 subjects in group A and 223 subjects in group B. Group A is a carvedilol intervention group, while group B is a placebo group. All patients in both groups will receive aetiology therapies and are followed up at an interval of 6 months. The 3-year incidences of decompensated events of cirrhosis-related and liver-related death are the primary outcome. The secondary outcomes include development of each complication of portal hypertension individually (ascites, variceal bleeding or overt hepatic encephalopathy), development of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis and other bacterial infections, development of new varices, growth of small varices to large varices, delta changes in LS and spleen stiffness, change in hepatic dysfunction assessed by Child-Pugh and model for end-stage liver disease score, change in platelet count, development of hepatocellular carcinoma, development of portal vein thrombosis and adverse events with a 3-year follow-up. A predefined interim analysis will be performed to ensure that the calculation is reasonable.

Major hepatectomy (resection of greater than or equal to three liver segments) is needed if a tumour is large or close to major blood vessels. Despite low mortality, open major hepatectomy is associated with high rates of tumour recurrence that limits survival. Laparoscopic major hepatectomy has been proposed as an alternative approach with potential oncological benefits. This study compares laparoscopic major hepatectomy with open major hepatectomy for hepatocellular carcinoma in a randomized trial. METHODS: The Asia-Pacific multicentre randomized trial of laparoscopic versus open major hepatectomy for hepatocellular carcinoma (AP-LAPO trial) is an open-labelled multicentre randomized trial to be conducted in five centres in the Asia-Pacific region. The study will test the hypothesis that laparoscopic major hepatectomy for hepatocellular carcinoma is associated with less tumour recurrence and better survival compared with open major hepatectomy; the primary outcome being 2-year recurrence-free survival. Secondary outcomes include hospital mortality, postoperative complications according to the Clavien-Dindo classification, time to functional recovery, quality of life, long-term survival, and postoperative serum surgical stress-related cytokines.

Herein, we examined whether QoL results correlated with PFS and OS outcomes in phase III randomized controlled trials (RCTs) investigating new systemic treatments in metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). METHODS: The systematic search of PubMed was conducted in October 2022. We identified 81 RCTs testing novel drugs in metastatic NSCLC and published in the English language in a PubMed-indexed journal between 2012 and 2021. Only trials reporting QoL results and at least one survival outcome between OS and PFS were selected. For each RCT, we assessed whether global QoL was ""superior,"" ""inferior,"" or with ""non-statistically significant difference"" in the experimental arm compared to the control arm. RESULTS: Experimental treatments led to superior QoL in 30 (37.0%) RCTs and inferior QoL in 3 (3.7%) RCTs. In the remaining 48 (59.3%) RCTs, a statistically significant difference between the experimental and control arms was not found. Of note, we found a statistically significant association between QoL and PFS improvements (X(2) = 3.93, p = 0.0473). In more detail, this association was not significant in trials testing immunotherapy or chemotherapy. On the contrary, in RCTs testing target therapies, QoL results positively correlated with PFS outcomes (p = 0.0196). This association was even stronger in the 32 trials testing EGFR or ALK inhibitors (p = 0.0077). On the other hand, QoL results did not positively correlate with OS outcomes (X(2) = 0.81, p = 0.368). Furthermore, we found that experimental treatments led to superior QoL in 27/57 (47.4%) trials with positive results and in 3/24 (12.5%) RCTs with negative results (p = 0.0028). Finally, we analyzed how QoL data were described in publications of RCTs in which QoL outcomes were not improved (n = 51). We found that a favorable description of QoL results was associated with sponsorship by industries (p = 0.0232).

185,Role of CENPF and NDC80 in the rehabilitation nursing of hepatocellular carcinoma and cirrhosis: An observational study.,Jia W; Wu Q; Li R; Hou S; Kang C,"Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the most common malignant tumors globally and often develops on the foundation of chronic liver disease or cirrhosis. Cirrhosis is a clinically prevalent chronic progressive liver disease characterized by diffuse liver damage resulting from long-term or repeated actions of 1 or more etiological factors. However, the impact of CENPF and nuclear division cycle 80 (NDC80) genes on rehabilitation nursing of HCC and cirrhosis remains unclear. HCC and cirrhosis datasets GSE63898 and GSE89377 profile files were downloaded from the gene expression omnibus database generated on platforms GPL13667 and GPL6947, respectively. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) screening, weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA), construction and analysis of protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks, functional enrichment analysis, gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA), survival analysis, immune infiltration analysis, and comparative toxicogenomics database (CTD) analysis were conducted. Gene expression heatmaps were plotted. miRNAs regulating central DEGs were selected through TargetScan. A total of 626 DEGs were identified. According to gene ontology (GO) analysis, they were primarily enriched in small molecule metabolic processes, drug metabolic processes, binding of identical proteins, and lipid metabolic processes. Kyoto Encyclopedia of Gene and Genome (KEGG) analysis results indicated that the target genes were mainly enriched in metabolic pathways, phagosomes, glycine, serine, and threonine metabolism. The construction and analysis of the PPI network revealed 3 core genes (NDC80, CENPF, RRM2). Gene expression heatmaps showed that core genes (CENPF, NDC80) were highly expressed in HCC and cirrhosis samples. CTD analysis found that 2 genes (CENPF and NDC80) were associated with liver, jaundice, ascites, fever, dyspepsia, and hepatic encephalopathy.

186,Prospective cohort for early detection of liver cancer (Pearl): a study protocol.,Khanna K; Barnes E; Benselin J; Culver E; Irving W; Innes H; Pavlides M; Consortium D,"INTRODUCTION: Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the fastest-rising and fourth most common cause of cancer death worldwide. Liver cirrhosis is the largest underlying risk factor for HCC. Therefore, patients with cirrhosis should have regular ultrasound and biochemical screening to pick up early HCC. Early HCC can be cured; more advanced HCCs have limited treatment options and poor prognosis. Current screening methods are suboptimal with poor sensitivity in picking up early disease. In this study, the investigators aim to recruit people with liver cirrhosis into a Prospective cohort for early detection of liver cancer-the Pearl cohort. The investigators believe that by using state-of-the-art tests we can improve the detection of early HCC. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: This is a UK-based prospective, longitudinal, diagnostic, prognostic, multicentre, non-CTIMP study. Aiming to recruit 3000 patients with liver cirrhosis without a HCC diagnosis, the Pearl cohort will be followed actively for 3 years from recruitment and then passively via registry data for ten years thereafter. Blood and urine samples will be taken and information from routine care will be gathered. These will be used to assess novel diagnostic approaches for the detection early HCC and to develop models to identify those most at risk for developing HCC.Participants will be linked to national UK health registries to ensure long-term capture of HCC incidence and other relevant endpoints. Approximately 75 patients are predicted to develop de novo HCC within the 3-year follow up period. After this period, the study teams will obtain data on participants for at least 10 years after the last contact. This cohort will help develop an understanding of the incidence of HCC in a UK population stratified by underlying cirrhosis aetiology.

Pirfenidone is approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration for treatment of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, and hydronidone is a novel structural modification of pirfenidone with the aim of reducing hepatoxicity. We aimed to investigate the safety and efficacy of hydronidone in patients with chronic hepatitis B (CHB)-associated liver fibrosis. METHODS: This was a 52-week multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase II study at 8 centers in China. Patients with CHB with biopsied documented liver fibrosis were eligible and were randomly assigned into receiving daily placebo or hydronidone orally (180 mg/day, 270 mg/day, or 360 mg/day). All enrolled subjects also received entecavir 0.5 mg/day. A second liver biopsy was performed at week 52. The primary endpoint was defined as fibrosis improvement (reduction of at least 1 Ishak score at week 52 of treatment). RESULTS: From June 25, 2015, to September 5, 2019, 168 patients with CHB and liver fibrosis met the inclusion/exclusion criteria and were subsequently randomized, 43 in the placebo group and 125 in the hydronidone groups (42 in the 180-mg group, 42 in the 270-mg group, and 41 in the 360-mg group). The fibrosis improvement endpoint was achieved by 11 patients (25.6%) in the placebo group and 17 patients (40.5%) in the 180-mg group (P = .12), 23 patients (54.8%) in the 270-mg group (P = .006), and 18 patients (43.90%) in the 360-mg group (P = .08). The improvement rate was 58 of 125 (46.4%) in the combined hydronidone group (P = .014). The overall safety profile and incidence of serious adverse events were similar among the groups. CONCLUSIONS: Hydronidone plus entecavir showed clinically significant histological improvement of liver fibrosis in patients with CHB, and the dose of 270 mg showed the best efficacy of fibrosis regression.

This study aims to evaluate the diagnostic performance of the new ACR contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) Nonradiation TRA LI-RADS v2024 in HCC treated with transarterial chemoembolization (TACE). MATERIALS AND METHODS: This retrospective observational study included 87 patients treated with TACE from a previously reported cohort. At 15- and 30-days post-treatment, 68 and 72 HCC lesions were evaluated. Three blinded radiologists with different levels of CEUS experience interpreted the images independently. According to CEUS Nonradiation TRA LI-RADSv2024, both intralesional and perilesional tumor viability were evaluated and final TRA categories were as follows: TR-Nonviable, TR-Equivocal, and TR-Viable. The reference standard used was a composite of histology and imaging. RESULTS: 140 HCC lesions were analyzed. At 15 days post-treatment, the sensitivity (SN), specificity (SP), positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV), and accuracy of TR-Viable classification ranged from 72.5-94.3%, 72.2-86.4%, 86.8-91.4%, 65.6-86.7%, 76.9-86.8%, respectively. At 30 days post-treatment, the SN, PPV, and NPV of TR-Viable classification decreased, ranging from 65.9-84.2%, 85.7-90.6%, and 59.5-73.9%, respectively, while the SP increased, ranging from 80.0-88.0%. Kappa values ranged from 0.557-0.730, indicating moderate to substantial agreement.

METHODS: We analysed 1027 patients enrolled between January 2015 and December 2017 and followed up for 24 months. Four hundred and twenty-two patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), 120 with intrahepatic carcinoma (ICC), 237 with colorectal liver metastases and 248 with liver metastases from other primaries were included. Prognostic factors were calculated with a univariable analysis by using the overall AEs burden score (AEBS). RESULTS: All-cause AEs were reported in 401/1027 (39.1%) patients, with AEs associated with TARE, such as abdominal pain (16.6%), fatigue (17%), and nausea (11.7%) reported most frequently. Grade 3 or higher AEs were reported in 92/1027 (9%) patients. Reports on grade ≥ 3 gastrointestinal ulcerations (0.4%), gastritis (0.3%), radiation cholecystitis (0.2%) or radioembolization-induced liver disease (0.5%) were uncommon. Univariable analysis showed that in HCC, AEBS increased for Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) 0 (p = 0.0045), 1 tumour nodule (0.0081),  > 1 TARE treatment (p = 0.0224), no prophylactic embolization (p = 0.0211), partition model dosimetry (p = 0.0007) and unilobar treatment target (0.0032).

190,Cost-Effectiveness Analysis of Camrelizumab Plus Rivoceranib Versus Sorafenib as a First-Line Therapy for Unresectable Hepatocellular Carcinoma in the Chinese Health Care System.,Lang W; Deng L; Huang B; Zhong D; Zhang G; Lu M; Ouyang M,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Camrelizumab plus rivoceranib showed significant clinical benefits in progression-free survival and overall survival compared to sorafenib in patients with unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). This study aimed to assess its cost effectiveness from the perspective of Chinese health care system. METHODS: A Markov state-transition model was developed based on the Phase 3 randomized CARES-310 clinical trial data. Health state utility values were obtained from the CARES-310 clinical trial, and direct medical costs were derived from the relevant literature and local charges. The measured outcomes included quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) and the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER). Probabilistic and one-way sensitivity analyses were performed to assess the uncertainty of the model. RESULTS: In the base-case analysis, the incremental effectiveness and cost of camrelizumab plus rivoceranib versus sorafenib were 0.41 QALYs and $13,684.84, respectively, resulting in an ICER of $33,619.98/QALY, lower than the willingness-to-pay threshold of China ($35,864.61/QALY). Subgroup analyses revealed that the ICERs of camrelizumab plus rivoceranib versus sorafenib were $35,920.01 and $29,717.98 in patients with ALBI grade 1 and grade 2, respectively. One-way sensitivity analyses indicated that the cost of camrelizumab, the proportion of patients receiving subsequent treatment in the camrelizumab plus rivoceranib group, and the cost of rivoceranib were the most significant factors in the base-case analysis. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis suggested that the probabilities of cost effectiveness of camrelizumab plus rivoceranib were 61.27%, 51.46%, and 82.78% for any grade, and ALBI grade 1 and grade 2, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Camrelizumab plus rivoceranib was more cost effective than sorafenib as first-line therapy for unresectable HCC in the Chinese setting.",True,"Matches all PICOS criteria: population, intervention, comparison, outcome, and study design align with target criteria.",patients with unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma,camrelizumab plus rivoceranib,sorafenib,progression-free survival and overall survival,randomized controlled trial,True,"Matches all PICOS criteria.

191,Study protocol for FASTRAK: a randomised controlled trial evaluating the cost impact and effectiveness of FAST-MRI for HCC suRveillance in pAtients with high risK of liver cancer.,Nahon P; Ronot M; Sutter O; Natella PA; Baloul S; Durand-Zaleski I; Audureau E,"INTRODUCTION: The surveillance of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) using semi-annual liver ultrasound (US) is justified in patients with cirrhosis. In this context, US has a low sensitivity (<30%) for the detection of HCC at the very early stage (ie, Barcelona clinic liver cancer (BCLC) 0, uninodular tumour <2 cm). The sensitivity of abbreviated liver MRI (AMRI) is reported to exceed 80%, but its use is hampered by costs and availability. Our hypothesis is that AMRI used as a screening examination in patients at high risk of HCC (>3% per year) could increase the rates of patients with a tumour detected at an early stage accessible to curative-intent treatment, and demonstrate its cost-effectiveness in this population. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: The FASTRAK trial is a multicentre, randomised controlled trial with two parallel arms, aiming for superiority and conducted on patients at high risk for HCC (yearly HCC incidence >3%). Randomisation will be conducted on an individual basis with a centralised approach and stratification by centre. After inclusion in the trial, each patient will be randomly assigned to the experimental group (semi-annual US and AMRI) or the control group (semi-annual US alone). The main objective is to assess the cost/quality-adjusted life year and cost/patient detected with a BCLC 0 HCC in both arms. A total of 944 patients will be recruited in 37 tertiary French centres during a 36-month period and will be followed-up during 36 months. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The FASTRAK trial received ethical approval on 4 April 2022.

We evaluated whether opt-out mailed outreach increased uptake with or without a $20 unconditional incentive. METHODS: This was a pragmatic randomized controlled trial in an urban academic health system including adult patients with cirrhosis or advanced fibrosis, at least 1 visit to a specialty practice in the past 2 years and no surveillance in the last 7 months. Patients were randomized in a 1:2:2 ratio to (1) usual care, (2) a mailed letter with a signed order for an ultrasound, or (3) a mailed letter with an order and a $20 unconditional incentive. The main outcome was the proportion with completion of ultrasound within 6 months. RESULTS: Among the 562 patients included, the mean age was 62.1 (SD 11.1); 56.8% were male, 51.1% had Medicare, and 40.6% were Black. At 6 months, 27.6% (95% CI: 19.5-35.7) completed ultrasound in the Usual care arm, 54.5% (95% CI: 47.9-61.0) in the Letter + Order arm, and 54.1% (95% CI: 47.5-60.6) in the Letter + Order + Incentive arm. There was a significant increase in the Letter + Order arm compared to Usual care (absolute difference of 26.9%; 95% CI: 16.5-37.3; p<0.001), but no significant increase in the Letter + Order + Incentive arm compared to Letter + Order (absolute difference of -0.4; 95% CI: -9.7 to 8.8; p=0.93).

However, the prognostic implication of P-I-R classification is not elucidated. Therefore, in the present research, we investigated the utility of P-I-R classification in predicting the on-treatment clinical outcomes. APPROACH AND RESULTS: In an extension study on a randomized controlled trial, we originally enrolled 1000 patients with chronic hepatitis B and biopsy-proven histological significant fibrosis, and treated them for more than 7 years with entecavir-based therapy. Among the 727 patients with a second biopsy at treatment week 72, we compared P-I-R classification and Ishak score changes in 646 patients with adequate liver sections for the histological evaluation. Progressive, indeterminate, and regressive cases were observed in 70%, 17%, and 13% of patients before treatments and 20%, 14%, and 64% after 72-week treatment, respectively, which could further differentiate the histological outcomes of patients with stable Ishak scores. The 7-year cumulative incidence of HCC was 1.5% for the regressive cases, 4.3% for the indeterminate cases, and 22.8% for the progressive cases ( p <0.001). After adjusting for age, treatment regimen, platelet counts, cirrhosis, Ishak fibrosis score changes, and Laennec staging, the posttreatment progressive had a HR of 17.77 (vs. posttreatment regressive; 95% CI: 5.55-56.88) for the incidence of liver-related events (decompensation, HCC, and death/liver transplantation). CONCLUSIONS: The P-I-R classification can be a meaningful complement to the Ishak fibrosis score not only in evaluating the histological changes but also in predicting the clinical outcomes.",False,Population and intervention do not match target criteria; focuses on hepatitis B rather than hepatocellular carcinoma.,patients with chronic hepatitis B and biopsy-proven histological significant fibrosis,entecavir-based therapy,not specified,7-year cumulative incidence of HCC,randomized controlled trial,False,Focuses on hepatitis B rather than hepatocellular carcinoma.

A controlled study was conducted on LABC patients treated at Jianyang People's Hospital and the First Affiliated Hospital of Chengdu Medical College from December 2020 to June 2022. The patients were randomly divided into the experimental group and the control group. The experimental group received DEB-TACE combined with the TAC regimen (175 mg/m(2) paclitaxel-loaded albumin, 50 mg/m(2) Doxorubicin, and 500 mg/m(2) cyclophosphamide), while the control group received the TAC regimen intravenously. The therapeutic efficacy was evaluated using the mRECIST criteria. Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS 22.0 software, and baseline characteristics, overall response rate (ORR), pathological complete response (PCR), adverse reactions, and complications were compared between the two groups using paired t-test and chi-square test. A total of 60 patients were included, with 30 patients in the experimental group (50%) and 30 patients in the control group (50%). After the first treatment, the ORR was 90% in the experimental group and 60% in the control group (P < 0.05). The overall ORR was 100% in the experimental group and 83% in the control group (P < 0.05). PCR was achieved in 14 patients (47%) in the experimental group and 4 patients (13%) in the control group. The main adverse reactions in the experimental group were skin blistering, pigmentation, and pain. There was no statistically significant difference in vomiting and grade II or above bone marrow suppression between the two groups. No grade III or above adverse events occurred in either group.

Progression-free survival (PFS) was the primary endpoint. Overall survival (OS), mRECIST-based objective response rates (ORR) and disease control rates (DCR), and treatment-related adverse events (TRAEs) were secondary endpoints. Totally 243 cases were randomized, with 122 and 121 in the DEB-TACE + apatinib and DEB-TACE groups, respectively. Cases administered DEB-TACE + apatinib displayed markedly improved median PFS (7.1 months [95%CI 6.6-8.3] vs. 5.2 months [95%CI 5.0-5.9]) and OS (23.3 months [95%CI 20.7-29.6] vs. 18.9 months [95%CI 17.9-20.1] compared with those treated with DEB-TACE (both p < 0.001). Additionally, patients administered DEB-TACE + apatinib had elevated ORR (56.6% vs. 38.8%) and DCR (89.3% vs. 80.2%) versus the DEB-TACE group (both p < 0.001). Majority of TRAEs were mild and manageable.

The objective was to establish a treatment volume absorbed dose that results in an absorbed dose of ≥ 120 Gy on the hyperemic zone around the ablation necrosis (i.e., target volume). METHODS: In this multicenter, prospective dose-escalation study in BCLC early stage HCC patients with lesions 2-5 cm, RFA was followed by (super-)selective infusion of (166)Ho-MS on day 5-10 after RFA. Dose distribution within the treatment volume was based on SPECT-CT. Cohorts of up to 10 patients were treated with an incremental dose (60 Gy, 90 Gy, 120 Gy) of (166)Ho-MS to the treatment volume. The primary endpoint was to obtain a target volume dose of ≥ 120 Gy in 9/10 patients within a cohort. RESULTS: Twelve patients were treated (male 10; median age, 66.5 years (IQR, [64.3-71.7])) with a median tumor diameter of 2.7 cm (IQR, [2.1-4.0]). At a treatment volume absorbed dose of 90 Gy, the primary endpoint was met with a median absorbed target volume dose of 138 Gy (IQR, [127-145]). No local recurrences were found within 1-year follow-up. CONCLUSION: Adjuvant (super-)selective infusion of (166)Ho-MS after RFA for the treatment of HCC can be administered safely at a dose of 90 Gy to the treatment volume while reaching a dose of ≥ 120 Gy to the target volume and may be a favorable adjuvant therapy for HCC lesions 2-5 cm.

The aim of this study was to report the results of acquired experience in a tertiary center for all unresectable HCCs. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective, observational study using data collected from consecutive patients undergoing SIRT between October 2013 and June 2020. DS was considered achieved when a curative treatment could be proposed 6 months after SIRT. RESULTS: One hundred twenty-seven patients were included (male = 90%, 64 ± 11 y), of whom 112 (n = 88%) had cirrhosis. HCC was classified as BCLC stage C in 64 patients (50%), with a median diameter of 61 mm, an infiltrative pattern in 51 patients (40%), and portal vein invasion in 62 (49%) patients. Fifty patients (39%) achieved DS 6 months following SIRT, with 29 of them (23%) undergoing curative treatment in a median time of 4.3 months: 17 (13%) were transplanted, 11 (85%) had liver resection, and 1 patient had a radiofrequency ablation. The median overall survival of patients with or without DS was 51 versus 10 months, respectively (p < 0.001). In patients who achieved DS, progression-free survival was higher in patients who underwent surgery: 47 versus 11 months (p < 0.001). Four variables were independently associated with DS: age (OR: 0.96, 95% CI: [0.92, 0.99]; p = 0.032), baseline α-fetoprotein (OR: 1.00, 95% CI: [1.00, 1.00]; p = 0.034), HCC distribution (OR: 0.3, 95% CI: [0.11, 0.75]; p = 0.012), and ALBI grade (OR: 0.34. 95% CI: [0.14, 0.80]; p = 0.014).

Given the considerable functional impairments in these patients, high musculoskeletal weight loads may not be well tolerated by all individuals. The use of blood-flow restricted resistance training (BFR-T) which only requires low training loads may allow for a faster recovery of muscle due to avoidance of high levels of mechanical muscle stress associated with high-load resistance exercise. This study aims to investigate whether BFR-T can prevent or slow down the loss of skeletal muscle mass and enhance the functional capacity and mental health of patients with pancreatic, biliary tract, and liver cancer. METHODS: The PREV-Ex exercise trial is a multicenter two-armed randomized controlled trial. Patients will be randomized to an exercise program consisting of home-based low-load BFR-T during a combined pre- and postoperative period for a total of 6-10 weeks (prehabilitation and rehabilitation), or to a control group. Protein supplementation will be given to both groups to ensure adequate protein intake. The primary outcomes, skeletal muscle thickness and muscle cross-sectional area, will be assessed by ultrasound. Secondary outcomes include the following: (i) muscle catabolism-related and inflammatory bio-markers (molecular characteristics will be assessed from a vastus lateralis biopsy and blood samples will be obtained from a sub-sample of patients); (ii) patient-reported outcome measures (self-reported fatigue, health-related quality of life, and nutritional status will be assessed through validated questionnaires); (iii) physical fitness/performance/activity (validated tests will be used to evaluate physical function, cardiorespiratory fitness and maximal isometric muscle strength. Physical activity and sedentary behavior (assessed using an activity monitor); (iv) clinical outcomes: hospitalization rates and blood status will be recorded from the patients' medical records; (v) explorative outcomes of patients' experience of the exercise program which will be evaluated using focus group/individual interviews. DISCUSSION: It is worthwhile to investigate new strategies that have the potential to counteract the deterioration of skeletal muscle mass, muscle function, strength, and physical function, all of which have debilitating consequences for patients with pancreatic, biliary tract, and liver cancer. The expected findings could improve prognosis, help patients stay independent for longer, and possibly reduce treatment-related costs. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT05044065.

200,Comparing the accuracy of prediction models to detect clinically relevant post-hepatectomy liver failure early after major hepatectomy.,Baumgartner R; Engstrand J; Rajala P; Grip J; Ghorbani P; Sparrelid E; Gilg S,"BACKGROUND: Arterial lactate measurements were recently suggested as an early predictor of clinically relevant post-hepatectomy liver failure (PHLF). This needed to be evaluated in the subgroup of major hepatectomies only. METHOD: This observational cohort study included consecutive elective major hepatectomies at Karolinska University Hospital from 2010 to 2018. Clinical risk factors for PHLF, perioperative arterial lactate measurements and routine lab values were included in uni- and multivariable regression analysis. Receiver operating characteristics and risk cut-offs were calculated. RESULTS: In total, 649 patients constituted the study cohort, of which 92 developed PHLF grade B/C according to the International Study Group of Liver Surgery (ISGLS). Lactate reached significantly higher intra- and postoperative levels in PHLF grades B and C compared to grade A or no liver failure (all P < 0.002). Lactate on postoperative day (POD) 1 was superior to earlier measurement time points in predicting PHLF B/C (AUC 0.75), but was outperformed by both clinical risk factors (AUC 0.81, P = 0.031) and bilirubin POD1 (AUC 0.83, P = 0.013). A multivariable logistic regression model including clinical risk factors and bilirubin POD1 had the highest AUC of 0.87 (P = 0.006), with 56.6% sensitivity and 94.7% specificity for PHLF grade B/C (cut-off ≥0.32). The model identified 46.7% of patients with 90-day mortality and had an equally good discriminatory potential for mortality as the established ISGLS criteria for PHLF grade B/C but could be applied already on POD1. CONCLUSION: The potential of lactate to predict PHLF following major hepatectomy was inferior to a prediction model consisting of clinical risk factors and bilirubin on first post-operative day.

This study aimed to evaluate the von Willebrand factor antigen (vWF-Ag) as a non-invasive test for clinically significant portal hypertension (CSPH) and a predictive biomarker for time to recurrence (TTR) and overall survival (OS). METHODS: The study recruited 72 HCC patients with detailed preoperative workup from a prospective trial (NCT02118545) and followed for complications, TTR, and OS. Additionally, 163 compensated patients with resectable HCC were recruited to evaluate vWF-Ag cutoffs for ruling out or ruling in CSPH. Finally, vWF-Ag cutoffs were prospectively evaluated in an external validation cohort of 34 HCC patients undergoing liver resection. RESULTS: In receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analyses, vWF-Ag (area under the curve [AUC], 0.828) was similarly predictive of PHLF as indocyanine green clearance (disappearance rate: AUC, 0.880; retention rate: AUC, 0.894), whereas computation of future liver remnant was inferior (AUC, 0.756). Cox-regression showed an association of vWF-Ag with TTR (per 10%: hazard ratio [HR], 1.056; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.017-1.097) and OS (per 10%: HR, 1.067; 95% CI 1.022-1.113). In the analyses, VWF-Ag yielded an AUC of 0.824 for diagnosing CSPH, with a vWF-Ag of 182% or lower ruling out and higher than 291% ruling in CSPH. Therefore, a highest-risk group (> 291%, 9.7% of patients) with a 57.1% incidence of PHLF was identified, whereas no patient with a vWF-Ag of 182% or lower (52.7%) experienced PHLF. The predictive value of vWF-Ag for PHLF and OS was externally validated. CONCLUSION: For patients with resectable HCC, VWF-Ag allows for simplified preoperative risk stratification.

The aim of this study was to identify the high-risk population for progressive hepatic fibrosis and the incidence of HCC and decompensated cirrhosis in chronic hepatitis B (CHB) patients with antiviral therapy. METHODS: The data came from a multicenter, center-randomized, double-blind clinical trial that analyzed only patients in the ETV-treated arm. There was 156 hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg)-positive and 135 HBeAg-negative patients in 14 institutions. The primary endpoint was fibrosis reversal on 72-week Entecavir (ETV) treatment. The 7-year cumulative incidence of HCC and decompensated cirrhosis were analyzed. Multivariate logistic and LASSO regression analyses were used to screen variables associated with fibrosis reversal. RESULTS: 86/156 (55%) HBeAg-positive and 58/135 (43%) HBeAg-negative patients achieved fibrosis reversal on 72-week ETV treatment.

We measured HCC incidence at the community level and assessed community-level HCC risk factors with the goal of informing resource allocation to improve early case detection, which is associated with improved outcomes. METHODS: Clinical and demographic data including census tract of residence for all adults diagnosed with HCC in the Connecticut Tumor Registry between 2008 and 2019 were combined with publicly available U.S. Census and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) data at the ZIP Code tabulation area (ZCTA) level. The average annual incidence of HCC was calculated for each ZCTA and associations between community-level characteristics, HCC incidence, stage at diagnosis, and survival were evaluated. RESULTS: Average annual HCC incidence during the study period was 8.9/100,000 adults and varied from 0 to 97.7 per 100,000 adults by ZCTA. At the community level, lower rates of high school graduation, higher rates of poverty, and rural community type were associated with higher HCC incidence. Persons with HCC living in the highest incidence ZCTAs were diagnosed at a younger age and were less likely to be alive at 1, 2, and 5 years after diagnosis.

It is heterogenous in terms of morphology, immunohistochemistry, radiology, and clinical features; making it a challenging entity for diagnosis. AIMS: The purpose of the present study was to evaluate clinicopathological characteristics of patients with cHCC-CCA. SETTINGS AND DESIGN: Retrospective observational study. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The patients diagnosed with cHCC-CC were identified from hepatic surgical specimens and were evaluated. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: Survival was estimated as per Kaplan-Meier method. RESULTS: Out of six patients, five had undergone resection while one had liver transplant. Five were male and one was female and the mean age was 52 years. Tumor markers revealed raised serum alfa-fetoprotein and CA19.9 in four and three patients, respectively. Five of the liver specimens were cirrhotic. Diagnosis was predominantly based on tumor morphology. All cases were of Allen and Lisa type B and cHCC-CCA as per WHO (2019) classification. Stem cell features <5% were noted in two cases. Immunohistochemistry for programmed death 1/programmed death ligand 1 (PD1/PDL1) was negative in both the hepatocellular and cholangiocellular components in all six cases. Mismatch repair (MMR) protein expression was retained in two and deficient in four cases. The median follow-up after surgery was 21.3 months (range, 5-46.2 months).

TPST-1120 displayed antitumor activity in xenograft models and synergistic tumor reduction in syngeneic tumor models when combined with anti-PD-1 agents. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: This phase I, open-label, dose-escalation study (NCT03829436) evaluated TPST-1120 as monotherapy in patients with advanced solid tumors and in combination with nivolumab in patients with renal cell carcinoma (RCC), cholangiocarcinoma (CCA), or hepatocellular carcinoma. Objectives included evaluation of safety, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and preliminary antitumor activity (RECIST v1.1). RESULTS: A total of 39 patients enrolled with 38 treated (20 monotherapy, 18 combination; median 3 prior lines of therapy). The most common treatment-related adverse events (TRAE) were grade 1-2 nausea, fatigue, and diarrhea. No grade 4-5 TRAEs or dose-limiting toxicities were reported. In the monotherapy group, 53% (10/19) of evaluable patients had a best objective response of stable disease. In the combination group, 3 patients had partial responses, for an objective response rate of 20% (3/15) across all doses and 30% (3/10) at TPST-1120 ≥400 mg twice daily. Responses occurred in 2 patients with RCC, both of whom had previously progressed on anti-PD-1 therapy, and 1 patient with late-line CCA. CONCLUSIONS: TPST-1120 was well tolerated as monotherapy and in combination with nivolumab and the combination showed preliminary evidence of clinical activity in PD-1 inhibitor refractory and immune compromised cancers. SIGNIFICANCE: TPST-1120 is a first-in-class oral inhibitor of PPARα, whose roles in metabolic and immune regulation are implicated in tumor proliferation/survival and inhibition of anticancer immunity.

This study evaluated personalized tumor dose (TD) as a predictor of OS, progression-free survival (PFS), and local duration of response (DOR) in patients with surgically unresectable HCC treated with resin 90 Y radioembolization. PATIENTS AND METHODS: This prospective, single-center, single-arm clinical trial (NCT04172714) evaluated the efficacy of scout activity of resin 90 Y versus 99m Tc-MAA for treatment planning. A secondary aim of this study was to evaluate personalized dosimetry as a predictor of OS, PFS, and DOR. Partition dosimetry model was utilized for nonsegmental therapies with targeted TD >200 Gy and nontumoral liver dose <70 Gy. Single compartment dose of 200 Gy was used for segmentectomies. OS, PFS, and local DOR from 90 Y was estimated using Kaplan-Meier estimation with log-rank analysis used to determine predictors of prolonged survival. FINDINGS: Thirty patients with treatment-naive HCC and 33 tumors (19 segmental and 14 nonsegmental) were included. Overall, 18 patients underwent segmental Y90-RE and 12 underwent non-segmental/lobar therapies. The mean 90 Y TD was 493 Gy. The median follow-up since enrollment into the study was 37 months.

Long-term indiscriminate use of antibiotics has led to drug resistance in Salmonella, and thus the identification of alternatives to antibiotics is crucial. In this study, the effects of puerarin on the S. enterica-infected chickens were investigated. A total of 360 chicks were randomly assigned as the control group (CON), the S. enterica group (S), and puerarin-treatment group (P). Chicks in the P group were fed the basal diet supplemented with 50 (P50), 100 (P100), 200 (P200), and 400 (P400) mg/kg puerarin, respectively. It was found that puerarin treatment markedly altered the serum activities of aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine transaminase (ALT), and superoxide dismutase (SOD), together with the malondialdehyde (MDA) and total antioxidant capacity (T-AOC) contents in the serum. The mRNA expression of IL-6, IL-1β, TNF-α, Bcl-2, and caspase-8 in the livers of S. enterica-infected chicks was increased after infection but significantly reduced after treatment with puerarin. Histologic analysis showed that puerarin effectively mitigated morphological damage in the liver caused by S. enterica. Proteomic analysis revealed that S. enterica infection led to metabolic disorders in the liver, resulting in oxidative stress, increased inflammation, and significantly elevated levels of hepatocellular carcinoma biomarkers. The findings of the filtered sequencing were verified by using quantitative PCR (qPCR). Treatment with 100 mg/mL puerarin thus effectively alleviated disordered liver metabolism, reduced inflammation and oxidative damage and significantly reduced the levels of hepatocellular carcinoma biomarkers in the liver.

212,Efficacy of blood plasma spectroscopy for early liver cancer diagnostics in obese patients.,Hříbek P; Vrtělka O; Králová K; Klasová J; Fousková M; Habartová L; Kubíčková K; Kupsa T; Tůma T; Setnička V; Urbánek P,"INTRODUCTION AND OBJECTIVES: Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) represents one of the most common cancers worldwide. A considerable proportion of HCC is caused by cirrhosis related to metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH). Due to the increasing prevalence of metabolic syndrome, it is estimated that MASH-related HCC will become the most prevalent etiology of HCC. Currently, HCC screening is based on liver ultrasonography; however, the sensitivity of ultrasonography for early HCC stages in obese patients only reaches 23 %. To date, no studied biomarker shows sufficient efficacy for screening purposes. Nevertheless, the usage of spectroscopic methods offers a new perspective, as its potential use would provide cheap, fast analysis of samples such as blood plasma. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We employed a combination of conventional and chiroptical spectroscopic methods to study differences between the blood plasma of obese cirrhotic patients with and without HCC. We included 20 subjects with HCC and 17 without evidence of liver cancer, all of them with body mass index ≥ 30. RESULTS: Sensitivities and specificities reached values as follows: 0.780 and 0.905 for infrared spectroscopy, 0.700 and 0.767 for Raman spectroscopy, 0.840 and 0.743 for electronic circular dichroism, and 0.805 and 0.923 for Raman optical activity. The final combined classification model based on all spectroscopic methods reached a sensitivity of 0.810 and a specificity of 0.857, with the highest area under the receiver operating characteristic curve among all models (0.961).

We conducted a multicenter, Zelen-designed randomized controlled trial to determine the effectiveness of warfarin in cirrhotic patients with non-symptomatic PVT during a one-year follow-up. In brief, 64 patients were 1:1 randomly divided into the anticoagulation group or the untreated group. The probability of recanalization was significantly higher in the anticoagulation group than those untreated in both ITT analysis (71.9% vs 34.4%, p = 0.004) and PP analysis (76.7% vs 32.4%, p < 0.001). Anticoagulation treatment was the independent predictor of recanalization (HR 2.776, 95%CI 1.307-5.893, p = 0.008). The risk of bleeding events and mortality were not significantly different. A significantly higher incidence of ascites aggravation was observed in the untreated group (3.3% vs 26.5%, p = 0.015).

The objective was to evaluate whether pre-PTR chemotherapy could improve progression-free survival (PFS) for patients with asymptomatic synchronous unresectable CRLMs. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients with asymptomatic synchronous unresectable CRLMs were randomly assigned to receive pre-PTR chemotherapy (arm A) or upfront PTR (arm B). Chemotherapy regimens of mFOLFOX6 plus cetuximab, mFOLFOX6 plus bevacizumab or mFOLFOX6 alone were chosen according to the RAS genotype. The primary end-point was PFS; secondary end-points included overall survival (OS), tumour response, disease control rate (DCR), liver metastases resection rate, surgical complications and chemotherapy toxicity. RESULTS: Three hundred and twenty patients were randomly assigned to arm A (160 patients) and arm B (160 patients). Patients in arm A had significantly improved the median PFS compared with arm B (10.5 versus 9.1 months; P = 0.013).

METHODS: This study included thirty-five patients undergoing laparoscopic hepatectomy from January 2021 to December 2021. Patients received a short infusion of 1% lidocaine at a dose of 1.5 mg/kg based on ideal body weight, followed by a continuous infusion of 1 mg/kg/h during the operation. The plasma concentrations of lidocaine and its active metabolites were measured using validated ultra-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. Safety was evaluated by monitoring and recording all adverse events (AEs). RESULTS: The concentrations of lidocaine were within the safe range, except one patient's concentration of lidocaine which reached the toxic range (> 5 μg/mL). The mean half-life (T(1/2)), the mean time to maximum observed concentration (T(max)), and the mean maximum observed concentration (C(max)) of lidocaine were 3.96 h, 2.85 h, and 2030 ng/mL, respectively; the mean T(1/2), T(max), and C(max) (n = 32) of MEGX were 6.59 h, 5.05 h, and 333.28 ng/mL, respectively; and the mean T(1/2), T(max), and C(max) of GX (n = 18) were 25.98 h, 7.33 h, and 75.81 ng/mL. Although eight subjects with AEs were reported, there were no serious AEs or deaths. No patients had serious postoperative complications. No deaths occurred within 30 days after the operation. CONCLUSIONS: Under the administration regimen of this study, intravenous infusion of lidocaine is safe and tolerable for liver cancer patients with laparoscopic hepatectomy.

Although the prognostic impact of incidental hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) or intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (iCC) in liver transplant recipients is well documented, there are no data on the impact in simultaneous liver kidney transplant (LKT) recipients. METHODS: This is a single-center observational, retrospective study of all LKT performed from May 1993 to April 2022. Among these patients, demographic data, immunosuppressive therapy, rejection episodes, and prevalence of incidental HCC or iCC were evaluated. RESULTS: One hundred eight LKTs were performed and 6 were excluded. There were 13 patients with incidental carcinomas in the explanted liver: one of them with both an HCC and iCC, one with an iCC, and the remaining with an HCC. One case of iCC died. No other recurrences occurred. There were no cases of incidental HCC nor iCC in patients with a hereditary or metabolic LKT indication. We found no differences in the 5-year patient survival, and death-censored kidney and liver graft survival rates for those LKT with an incidental HCC and those without it (76.9% vs 84.2%, P = .5; 100% vs 91.6%, P = .28; and 100% vs 94.7%, P = 0.39, respectively). Finally, there were no significant associations between explant carcinoma and rejections of the liver (7.7% vs 17.9%, P = .34) or kidney graft (0% vs 16.8%, P = 0.11).

In this study, we aimed to describe time trends, incidence, prevalence, and mortality of a wide range of chronic liver diseases in Sweden. METHODS: In this register-based, nationwide observational study, patients with a register-based diagnosis of chronic liver disease, during 2005-2019, were retrieved from the Swedish National Board of Health and Welfare. Annual age-standardized incidence and mortality rates, and prevalence per 100,000 inhabitants was calculated and stratified on age, sex, and geographical region. RESULTS: The incidence of alcohol-related cirrhosis increased by 47% (2.6% annually), reaching an incidence rate of 13.1/100,000 inhabitants. The incidence rate of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease and unspecified liver cirrhosis increased by 217% and 87% (8.0 and 4.3% annually), respectively, reaching an incidence rate of 15.2 and 18.7/100,000 inhabitants, and a prevalence of 24.7 and 44.8/100,000 inhabitants. Furthermore, incidence rates of chronic hepatitis C declined steeply, but liver malignancies have become more common. The most common causes of liver-related mortality were alcohol-related liver disease and unspecified liver disease. CONCLUSION: The incidence rates of diagnosed non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, alcohol-related cirrhosis, unspecified liver cirrhosis, and liver malignancies have increased during the last 15 years. Worryingly, mortality in several liver diseases increased, likely reflecting increasing incidences of cirrhosis in spite of a decreasing rate of hepatitis C.

218,"The Cancer Incidence and Trends From 2011 to 2018 in Ma'anshan, China: A Registry-Based Observational Study.",Qin Q; Min Y; Xie Y; Wang C; Zhang Y; Wu D; Xu J; Meng N; Suo C,"BACKGROUND: The cancer burden in China has been increasing over the decades. However, the cancer incidence remains unknown in Ma'anshan, which is one of the central cities in the Yangtze River Delta in Eastern China. The study was designed to describe the cancer incidence and trends in Ma'anshan from 2011 to 2018, providing information about cancer etiology that is useful for prevention programs. METHODS: The cancer incidence rate and age-standardized incidence rate (ASIR) were calculated using the cancer registry data in Ma'anshan during 2011-2018. The average annual percentage change (AAPC) of the ASIR was analyzed by the Joinpoint regression analysis. Age, period, and cohort effects on cancer incidence were estimated through the age-period-cohort model. RESULTS: There were 13,508 newly diagnosed cancer cases in males and 9558 in females in Ma'anshan during 2011-2018. The ASIR maintained a steady trend in both males and females. Age effects showed that cancer risk increased with age in both genders; no visible period effects were detected during this study period. Cohort effects changed slowly until the end of the 1950s, then started decreasing in males while increasing in females after 1960. Lung, gastric, female breast, colorectal, cervical, esophageal, liver, thyroid, lymphoma, and pancreatic cancer were the most common cancers in Ma'anshan during the study period. The ASIR of gastric cancer (AAPC: -3.72%), esophageal cancer (AAPC: -8.30%), and liver cancer (AAPC: -5.55%) declined, while that of female breast cancer (AAPC: 3.91%), colorectal cancer (AAPC: 3.23%), and thyroid cancer (AAPC: 22.38%) rose. CONCLUSION: During 2011-2018, the cancer incidence in Ma'anshan was lower than that in China, nation-wide. The incidence of upper gastrointestinal cancer decreased gradually while female breast, colorectal, and thyroid cancers showed an upward trend, consistent with the changes in the cancer spectrum in China.

The impact of chronic liver diseases on the course and outcome of COVID-19 is still the subject of research. The aim of this study was to show the characteristics of COVID-19 patients with chronic liver diseases, and to establish the risk factors for unfavourable outcome. METHODS: A retrospective observational study was conducted at the Infectious Disease Clinic in Belgrade, Serbia, and included 80 patients with chronic liver diseases and COVID-19 within a time frame of two years (between 15 March 2020 and 15 March 2022). Characteristics of the affected persons, as well as the risk factors for a fatal outcome, were analyzed. RESULTS: Of the 80 subjects in the study, 23.8% had chronic viral hepatitis, 12.5% autoimmune liver diseases and alcoholic liver disease respectively, 30% had non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, while 11.2% had chronic liver diseases of unknown aetiology. A total of 33.7% had cirrhosis, 6.3% hepatocellular carcinoma and 5% had liver transplants. A total of 92.5% of respondents had pneumonia (21.2% were critically ill). A deterioration of chronic liver disease was registered among 33.7% of patients, and decompensation in 3.8%; 76.3% patients recovered, while 23.7% had a lethal outcome. Risk factors for lethal outcome by univariate analysis were: alcoholic liver disease, cirrhosis, increased transaminases values prior to COVID-19, malignancy, severe pneumonia and dyspnea. In a multivariate analysis, the presence of liver cirrhosis (OR = 69.1, p = 0.001) and severe pneumonia (OR = 22.3, p = 0.006) remained independently predictive for lethal outcome.

220,Clinical epidemiology of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease in children and adolescents. The LiverKids: Study protocol.,Chacón C; Arteaga I; Martínez-Escudé A; Ruiz Rojano I; Lamonja-Vicente N; Caballeria L; Ribatallada Diez AM; Schröder H; Montraveta M; Bovo MV; Ginés P; Pera G; Diez-Fadrique G; Pachón-Camacho A; Alonso N; Graupera I; Torán-Monserrat P; Expósito C,"BACKGROUND: Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is rapidly increasing alongside overweight and obesity, not only in adults but also in children and adolescents. It is unknown what impact the development of NAFLD in childhood may have in later life. The importance of early detection and treatment lies in its potential for progression to cirrhosis, liver cancer and liver-related death, as well as its associated extrahepatic comorbidities. Vibration-Controlled Transient Elastography (VCTE) with Controlled Attenuation Parameter (CAP) is an effective, non-invasive and safe diagnostic method to estimate the degree of fibrosis and steatosis in the liver, but little is known about its applicability in the paediatric population. AIMS: 1) To assess the prevalence of significant liver fibrosis (Liver Stiffness Measurement (LSM) ≥6.5 kPa) using VCTE, and that of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (≥225 dB/m) using CAP in children and adolescents. 2) To determine the optimal cut-off points of the CAP to achieve maximum concordance with the Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) findings in the diagnosis of mild, moderate and severe NAFLD in children and adolescents. METHODS: Cross-sectional population-based study which will include 2,866 subjects aged between 9 and 16 years. Participants will undergo: anamnesis, physical examination, blood extraction, VCTE, MRI and questionnaires on socio-demographic data, personal and family medical history and lifestyle assessment. APPLICABILITY AND RELEVANCE: The study aims to establish the foundations for the use of VCTE in children and adolescents in order to achieve early diagnosis of NAFLD. Moreover, it will serve to understand in further detail the disease and to identify the risk groups of children and adolescents who may be at risk of developing it. Ultimately, this will help determine to which subgroups of the population we need to target resources for prevention and early detection of this entity, as well as possible intervention for its treatment.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between April 2011 and March 2022, 2281 HCC patients with an HBV-related diagnosis were included. All patients were randomly divided into two groups in a ratio of 7:3 (training cohort, n = 1597; validation cohort, n = 684). The nomogram was built in the training cohort via Cox regression model and validated in the validation cohort. RESULTS: Multivariate Cox analyses revealed that the portal vein tumor thrombus, Child-Pugh class, tumor diameter, alanine aminotransferase level, tumor number, extrahepatic metastases, and therapy were independent predictive variables impacting overall survival. We constructed a new nomogram to predict 1-, 2-, and 3-year survival rates based on these factors. The nomogram-related receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curves indicated that the area under the curve (AUC) values were 0.809, 0.806, and 0.764 in predicting 1-, 2-, and 3-year survival rates, respectively. Furthermore, the calibration curves revealed good agreement between real measurements and nomogram predictions. The decision curve analyses (DCA) curves demonstrated excellent therapeutic application potential. In addition, stratified by risk scores, low-risk groups had longer median OS than medium-high-risk groups (p < 0.001).

No randomized trials were done. This study aims to compare the 1-year HCC recurrence rates in patients who received DAAs after tumor ablation versus those who postponed HCV treatment for 1 year. METHODS: Included patients were randomized after complete HCC ablation into two groups: a postponed DAAs group for whom DAAs initiation was postponed for 12 months and a DAAs group who were given sofosbuvir/velpatasvir. Patients were followed for 1 year. RESULTS: Eighty-four HCV patients with a mean age of 56.35 ± 8.12 years were included; 78.57% of them were males. The number of lesions per patient ranged from 1 to 3 lesions, and the size of the largest lesion ranged from 1.5 to 5 cm. There were no statistically significant differences between both groups regarding baseline characteristics. In the DAAs group (43 patients), 11 patients had HCC recurrence, while 25 patients in the postponed DAAs group (41 patients) had HCC recurrence. Using Kaplan-Meier analysis, the 1-year recurrence-free survival (RFS) was significantly higher in the DAAs group (72.2% vs. 38%, P = 0.001). On multivariate analysis, both higher albumin levels (HR 0.147, 95% CI 0.066-0.329) and receiving DAAs (HR 0.358, 95% CI 0.176-0.730) 1 year after ablation were associated with significantly lower recurrence. CONCLUSION: Direct-acting antiviral usage after complete hepatocellular carcinoma ablation significantly decreases the 1-year HCC recurrence rates, but the risk of recurrence is still not eliminated. The study registration number on clinicaltrials.gov : NCT04653818 (initial release on 28/11/2020).

223,The impact of preoperative interview and prospective nursing on perioperative psychological stress and postoperative complications in patients undergoing TACE intervention for hepatocellular carcinoma.,Gao L; Chen W; Qin S; Yang X,"TACE has become one of the main methods for the treatment of liver cancer. The study aimed to investigate the effects of preoperative interview and prospective nursing in patients with hepatic carcinoma undergoing transcatheter chemoembolization (TACE). Eighty-six patients with hepatocellular carcinoma who underwent TACE intervention treatment at our hospital between 2020 and 2023 were selected and randomly assigned to 2 groups using computerized randomization. The control group (n = 43) received routine nursing care, while the study group (n = 43) received preoperative interviews in combination with prospective nursing during the procedure. The patients' heart rate, mean arterial pressure, and blood pressure variations were recorded, along with their mood changes after intervention. The postoperative pain and satisfaction levels were compared between the 2 groups of patients, and the incidence of postoperative complications was observed. The heart rate, systolic blood pressure, and diastolic blood pressure of the 2 groups of patients were compared 1 day before the operation (P > .05). Compared to 1 day before the operation, there was no significant change for the study group at 10 minutes after entering the room. However, the control group showed an increase. Both groups showed an increase in heart rate, systolic blood pressure, and diastolic blood pressure after the operation, with the study group having lower values than the control group (P < .05). The levels of tension, fatigue, anxiety, energy, anger, depression, self-esteem, and POMS index were compared between the 2 groups before intervention (P > .05). After intervention, there were significant differences between the 2 groups(P < .05). Immediately after the operation, the NRS scores of the 2 groups of patients were compared (P > .05). Compared to the control group, the study group showed a decrease in NRS scores at 12, 24, and 48 hours after the operation (P < .05). The nursing satisfaction rate of the study group patients was 97.67% (42/43), which was higher than the nursing satisfaction rate of the control group of 76.74% (33/43) (P < .05).

In this study we describe clinical, radiological, and laboratory characteristics in Nigerian adults with HCC, with and without HIV, and examine how HIV impacts survival. METHODS: This prospective observational study was conducted between August 2018 and November 2021 at two Nigerian hospitals [Jos University Teaching Hospital (JUTH) and Lagos University Teaching Hospital (LUTH)]. Subjects ≥18 years with HCC diagnosed according to American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD) criteria were included. Baseline characteristics were compared, and Kaplan-Meier curves were generated to estimate survival. RESULTS: 213 subjects [177 (83%) without HIV and 36 (17%) with HIV (PLH)] were enrolled. Median age was 52 years (IQR 42,60) and most subjects were male (71%). 83% PLH were on antiretroviral therapy (ART). Hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) positivity was similar between the two groups [91/177 (51%) without HIV vs. 18/36 (50%) with HIV; p = 0.86]. 46/213 (22%) subjects had active hepatitis C (anti-HCV+/HCV RNA>10 IU/mL). Cirrhosis was more common in PLH but there were no other significant differences in clinical and tumor characteristics between the groups. Overall, 99% subjects were symptomatic and 78% in late-stage HCC. Median overall survival was significantly shorter in PLH vs. without HIV (0.98 months vs 3.02 months, HR = 1.55, 95%CI 1.02, 2.37, p = 0.04). This association was not significant after adjusting for known risk factors including gender, current alcohol use, alpha-fetoprotein (AFP), albumin, and total bilirubin (HR = 1.38, 95%CI 0.84, 2.29, p = 0.21). CONCLUSION: HCC presented late with an extremely poor overall prognosis, highlighting the urgent need for more intensive surveillance in Nigeria to diagnose HCC at earlier stages. Early diagnosis and management of viral hepatitis, and access to HCC therapies, could prevent early mortality among persons with HCC, especially among PLH. the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original author and source are credited.",False,Intervention and comparison not specified; study design does not match target criteria.,"Nigerian adults with hepatocellular carcinoma, with and without HIV",not specified,not specified,survival,prospective observational study,False,Intervention and comparison are not specified.

225,Effect of bariatric surgery on NAFLD/NASH: a single-centre observational prospective cohort study.,Theel WB; Boxma-de Klerk BM; Dirksmeier-Harinck F; van Rossum EF; Kanhai DA; Apers JA; van Dalen BM; De Knegt RJ; Neecke B; van der Zwan EM; Grobbee DE; Hankemeier T; Wiebolt J; Castro Cabezas M,"INTRODUCTION: The prevalence of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) ranges from 25% in the general population to 90% in patients with obesity scheduled for bariatric surgery. NAFLD can progress towards non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) associated with complications such as cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma and cardiovascular disease. To date, losing weight and lifestyle modifications are the best known treatments for NASH. Bariatric surgery significantly improves NAFLD/NASH in the short term. However, the extent of this improvement is not yet clear and long-term data on the natural course of NAFLD/NASH after bariatric surgery are lacking. The factors involved in NAFLD/NASH regression after bariatric surgery have not been elucidated. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: This is an observational prospective cohort study including patients scheduled for bariatric surgery. Extensive metabolic and cardiovascular analyses will be carried out including measurements of carotid intima media thickness and pulse wave velocity. Genomic, proteomic, lipidomic and metabolomic studies will be done. Microbioma analyses before and 1 year after surgery will be done. Transient elastography measurements will be performed before and at 1, 3 and 5 years after surgery. For those with an elevated preoperative transient elastography measurement by Fibroscan, a laparoscopic liver biopsy will be performed during surgery. Primary outcome measures are the change of steatosis and liver fibrosis 5 years after surgery.

226,Human Umbilical Cord Blood-Derived Mesenchymal Stem Cell Transplantation for Patients with Decompensated Liver Cirrhosis.,Li Z; Zhou X; Han L; Shi M; Xiao H; Lin M; Chi X,"BACKGROUND OR PURPOSE: Although human umbilical cord blood-derived mesenchymal stem cell transplantation (HUCB-MSCT) resulted in a good short-term therapeutic effect on patients with decompensated liver cirrhosis (DLC), the long-term survival remained unclear. This study aimed to evaluate the impact of HUCB-MSCT on long-term outcomes in patients with DLC. METHODS: This retrospective cohort study included hospitalized patients with decompensated cirrhosis in Liuzhou Hospital of Traditional Chinese Medicine between November 2010 and February 2013. The primary outcome was overall survival (OS). The secondary outcomes were 3-year and 5-year survival rates and the occurrence rate of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). RESULTS: A total of 201 subjects were enrolled, including 36 patients who underwent HUCB-MSCT (SCT group) and 165 patients who did not (non-SCT group). After PSM (1:2), there were 36 patients in the SCT group and 72 patients in non-SCT group. The 3-year and 5-year survival rates of the two groups were 83.3% vs. 61.8% and 63.9% vs. 43.6%, and median OS time was 92.50 and 50.80 months, respectively. HUCB-MSCT treatment was found to be an independent beneficial factor for patient OS (hazard ratio = 0.47; 95% CI: 0.29-0.76; P = 0.002). There was no significant difference in the occurrence rate of HCC between the two groups (P = 0.410).

Prospective studies on the safety and efficacy of the unilobar radioembolization-surgery treatment algorithm are lacking. The RALLY study aims to assess the safety and toxicity profile of holmium-166 unilobar radioembolization in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma ineligible for surgery due to insufficiency of the future liver remnant. METHODS: The RALLY study is a multicenter, interventional, non-randomized, open-label, non-comparative safety study. Patients with hepatocellular carcinoma who are considered ineligible for surgery due to insufficiency of the future liver remnant (< 2.7%/min/m(2) on hepatobiliary iminodiacetic acid scan will be included. A classical 3 + 3 dose escalation model will be used, enrolling three to six patients in each cohort. The primary objective is to determine the maximum tolerated treated non-tumourous liver-absorbed dose (cohorts of 50, 60, 70 and 80 Gy). Secondary objectives are to evaluate dose-response relationships, to establish the safety and feasibility of surgical resection following unilobar radioembolization, to assess quality of life, and to generate a biobank. DISCUSSION: This will be the first clinical study to assess the unilobar radioembolization-surgery treatment algorithm and may serve as a stepping stone towards its implementation in routine clinical practice.

However, the available data on patients with HCC are conflicting. The aim of this study was to assess the impact of body composition on survival in patients with HCC treated with sorafenib or selective internal radioembolization (SIRT) and sorafenib. METHODS: This is an exploratory subanalysis of the prospective, randomized controlled SORAMIC trial. Within the palliative arm of the study, patients were selected if a baseline abdominal CT was available. A broad set of skeletal muscle and adipose tissue parameters were measured at the L3 level. Low skeletal muscle mass (LSMM) and density parameters were defined using published cutoffs. The parameters were correlated with overall survival. RESULTS: Of 424 patients in the palliative study arm, 369 patients were included in the analysis. There were 192 patients in the combined sorafenib/SIRT and 177 patients in the sorafenib group. Median overall survival was 9.9 months for the entire cohort and 10.8 and 9.2 months for the SIRT/sorafenib and sorafenib groups, respectively. There was no relevant association of either body composition parameter with overall survival in either the overall cohort or in the SIRT/sorafenib or sorafenib subgroups.

229,Bevacizumab and Atezolizumab for Unresectable Hepatocellular Carcinoma: Real-world Data in Taiwan-Tainan Medical Oncology Group H01 Trial.,Lee YC; Huang WT; Lee MY; Tsao CJ; Feng YH,"BACKGROUND/AIM: The combination of bevacizumab and atezolizumab (Bev-Ate) has been established as a standard first-line systemic treatment option for unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) since 2020. This study examined the outcomes of HCC patients who received the combination in southern Taiwan. PATIENTS AND METHODS: All patients were enrolled from four hospitals in Taiwan. They received Bev-Ate therapy for unresectable HCC. RESULTS: Thirty-five patients were included; 28 (80%) had Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer stage C disease. Hepatitis etiology was chronic hepatitis B and C in 63% and 17% of patients, respectively. Eleven (31%) patients had received prior systemic treatment for unresectable HCC. The response rate was 51%, and the disease control rate was 72% for all patients. The median progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) was 5.2 and 22.2 months, respectively. For patients who received prior systemic treatment, the efficacy of Bev-Ate in terms of response rates was similar compared with those without prior systemic treatment. Patients who received lower doses of bevacizumab (<15 mg/kg per dose) had non-inferior PFS and OS compared with those receiving a standard dose of bevacizumab. The incidence of proteinuria of all grades (15.8%) was less common when lower doses of bevacizumab were used. CONCLUSION: Real world data from HCC patients in southern Taiwan disclosed that the efficacy outcomes of Bev-Ate treatment were generally consistent with those of clinical trials in other countries. In patients who were exposed to prior systemic treatment or who received lower doses of bevacizumab, the Bev-Ate regimen retained its clinical efficacy.

This study aimed to establish a Faster region-based convolutional neural network (RCNN) model for the accurate differential diagnosis of PCCCL and CHCC. METHODS: In this study, we collected the data of 62 patients with PCCCL and 1079 patients with CHCC in Beijing YouAn Hospital from June 2012 to May 2020. A total of 109 patients with CHCC and 42 patients with PCCCL were randomly divided into the training validation set and the test set in a ratio of 4:1.The Faster RCNN was used for deep learning of patients' data in the training validation set, and established a convolutional neural network model to distinguish PCCCL and CHCC. The accuracy, average precision, and the recall of the model for diagnosing PCCCL and CHCC were used to evaluate the detection performance of the Faster RCNN algorithm. RESULTS: A total of 4392 images of 121 patients (1032 images of 33 patients with PCCCL and 3360 images of 88 patients with CHCC) were uesd in test set for deep learning and establishing the model, and 1072 images of 30 patients (320 images of nine patients with PCCCL and 752 images of 21 patients with CHCC) were used to test the model. The accuracy of the model for accurately diagnosing PCCCL and CHCC was 0.962 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.931-0.992). The average precision of the model for diagnosing PCCCL was 0.908 (95% CI: 0.823-0.993) and that for diagnosing CHCC was 0.907 (95% CI: 0.823-0.993). The recall of the model for diagnosing PCCCL was 0.951 (95% CI: 0.916-0.985) and that for diagnosing CHCC was 0.960 (95% CI: 0.854-0.962). The time to make a diagnosis using the model took an average of 4 s for each patient. CONCLUSION: The Faster RCNN model can accurately distinguish PCCCL and CHCC.

BMS-986,205 is a novel oral drug that potently and selectively inhibits IDO. This Phase I/II study evaluated the safety and tolerability of BMS-986,205 in combination with nivolumab as first-line therapy in advanced HCC. METHODS: Adults with untreated, unresectable/metastatic HCC received BMS-986,205 at two dose levels (50-100 mg orally daily) in combination with fixed dose nivolumab (240mg/m(2) IV on Day 1 of each 14-day cycle). The primary objective was to determine the safety and tolerability of this combination; secondary objectives were to obtain preliminary efficacy. RESULTS: Eight patients received a total of 91 treatment cycles in the dose escalation phase. All patients were Child Pugh A and 6 patients had underlying viral hepatitis. In the 6 evaluable patients, no dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) were observed. The most common treatment-related adverse events (TRAEs) were aspartate transaminase (AST) and alanine transaminase (ALT) elevation (3 patients) and diarrhea, maculopapular rash and increased alkaline phosphatase (2 patients each). Grade 3 events were diarrhea and AST elevation (1 patient), and hyperglycemia and pancreatitis requiring treatment discontinuation (1 patient). No grade 4-5 events occurred.

Methods: 56 patients who underwent TACE in our hospital from March 2022 to March 2023 were selected as the study subjects. The patients were randomly divided into a control group (28 cases) and an intervention group (28 cases). The control group received routine dietary intervention, while the intervention group received individualized nutritional intervention. We analyzed the body mass index (BMI), nutritional risk screening 2002 (NRS 2002), nutritional status, liver function status, and incidence of complications in two groups of patients before TACE, 3 days after TACE, and 1 month after TACE. Results: on the third day after TACE, the nutritional related indicators of both groups of patients showed a significantly decrease compared to those before TACE (p < 0.05), while the majority of liver function indicators significantly increased (p < 0.05). Compared with those at 3 days after TACE, the nutritional status of the intervention group patients significantly improved (p < 0.05) and liver function indicators significantly decreased (p < 0.05) 1 month after TACE. One month after TACE, all nutritional indicators in the intervention group were significantly higher than those in the control group (p < 0.05), and AST was significantly lower than that in the control group (p < 0.05). The incidence of gastrointestinal complications and electrolyte disorders in the intervention group were significantly lower than that in the control group (p < 0.05).

233,Feasibility of a Palliative Care Intervention within Routine Care of Hepatocellular Carcinoma: A Pilot Randomized Controlled Trial.,Verma M; Kalman R; Horrow J; Gallagher M; Woodrell C; Navarro V,"Background: Patients with hepatocellular cancer (HCC) are at risk for poor quality of life (QoL) and high symptom burden, coupled with limited treatment options. Palliative care (PC) can play an important role in reducing the suffering of this population, but remains underutilized. Aim: To demonstrate feasibility of an outpatient PC intervention within HCC care. Methods: This is a pilot randomized controlled trial conducted at an academic center. All stages of HCC patients (except Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer stage D) with a scheduled hepatology appointment were eligible. Patients were randomized to receive PC intervention or usual care (control arm). In the PC arm, patients received PC from a PC provider at enrollment and at three months from the baseline visit, in addition to continued standard of care. Control arm received only standard care. All patients completed FACT-Hep (Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Hepatobiliary Cancer) and modified Edmonton Symptom Assessment Scale at baseline and at three-month visit. Descriptive statistics were utilized to summarize questionnaires, and change in QoL and symptoms from baseline to three months were compared between the two study groups. Results: Of the 109 approached, 57 patients (52.3%) consented to enroll, and 52 (91%) completed the study. QoL and symptom burden assessments demonstrated impaired QoL and high symptom burden in both arms of the study. At least 50% of enrolled patients in each arm had some degree of fatigue, pain, sleep disturbance, and appetite loss, at baseline. Post-intervention, symptom burden and QoL improved in the intervention arm and remained same or worsened in the control group.

234,Screening and risk of hepatocellular carcinoma in patients with advanced fibrosis after hepatitis C virus eradication.,Espina Cadena S; Casas Deza D; Julián Gomara B; Borao Laguna CV; Sierra Gabarda O; Lamuela Calvo LJ; Lorente S; Serrano T; Arbonés Mainar JM; Bernal Monterde V,"INTRODUCTION: the risk of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) after eradication of the hepatitis C virus (HCV) is highly variable in patients with advanced fibrosis (F3). Long-term surveillance for HCC after sustained virological response (SVR) is controversial in these patients. The objective of this study was to describe the post-SVR follow-up in clinical practice in patients with F3 and determine the predictive factors for the development of HCC. PATIENTS AND METHODS: a multicenter, observational and retrospective study was performed, which included HCV-monoinfected patients with F3 fibrosis determined by transient elastography who achieved SVR between 2015 and 2022, with follow-up until May 2023. Clinical-demographic, laboratory, elastography, and ultrasound variables were recorded before and after treatment. A descriptive and inferential analysis, Cox regression analysis and survival analysis were carried out with the R statistical software. RESULTS: two hundred and nineteen patients were included in the study (65.3 % males, median age 57 years), and 175 (79.9 %) received ultrasound screening after SVR for 62 (6-90) months. The prescribing service was the only independent variable related to performing ultrasound surveillance (p = 0.004). Eight patients developed HCC. In multivariate analysis adjusted for sex, age, presence of diabetes and alcohol consumption, a post-SVR FIB-4 ≥ 3.25 was associated with a 12-fold increase in HCC risk. The cumulative probability of HCC was higher in the group of patients with FIB-4 ≥ 3.25 after SVR (p < 0.001).

We aimed to examine the association between lung function and NAFLD among the general population in an observational and Mendelian randomization (MR) study. METHODS AND RESULTS: 340, 253 participants without prior liver diseases were included from the UK Biobank. Of these, 30,397 participants had liver proton density fat fraction (PDFF) measurements by magnetic resonance image (MRI). Lung function parameters included forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1) and forced vital capacity (FVC). The primary outcome was the presence of NAFLD, defined as a PDFF greater than 5.5%. The secondary outcome included incident severe NAFLD and severe liver diseases (including liver cirrhosis, liver failure, hepatocellular carcinoma and liver-related death), defined by the International Classification of Disease codes with different data sources. During a media follow-up duration of 9.3 years, 7335 (24.1%) the presence of NAFLD cases were documented. There was an inverse association of FEV1 (% predicted) (Per SD increment, adjusted OR = 0.91, 95%CI: 0.88-0.94) and FVC (% predicted) (Per SD increment, adjusted OR = 0.90, 95%CI: 0.87-0.92) with the presence of NAFLD. Similar results were found for incident severe NAFLD, severe liver disease, liver cirrhosis, liver failure and liver-related death. MR analyses showed that the genetically predicted FEV1 (adjusted OR = 0.63, 95%CI: 0.46-0.87) and FVC (adjusted OR = 0.69, 95%CI: 0.51-0.95) were both inversely associated with the presence of NAFLD.

237,Transfusions of packed red blood cells in surgery for liver cancer: predictor of impaired overall survival but not recurrence-free survival - impact of blood transfusions in liver surgery.,Giehl-Brown E; Geipel E; Löck S; Dehlke K; Schweipert J; Weitz J; Riediger C,"BACKGROUND: Liver surgery remains a cornerstone of potentially curative multimodal treatments for primary malignancies of the liver and hepatic metastases. Improving perioperative safety is a prerequisite in this context. Perioperative blood transfusions negatively influence postoperative recovery. This study aimed to identify risk factors for perioperative packed red blood cell (PRBC) transfusion and to elucidate its effect on postoperative outcomes. METHODS: This was an observational study of a prospective data collection. A monocentric, retrospective analysis of 1118 hepatectomies at the University Hospital Carl Gustav Carus between 2013 and 2020 was conducted to compare postoperative short- and long-term outcomes in patients undergoing curative intended liver resection of hepatic primary or secondary malignancies. The outcomes were compared between 356 patients (31.8%) who received PRBC transfusions during surgery or within 7 days after surgery and 762 patients (68.2%) who did not receive PRBC transfusions. RESULTS: Preoperative anemia could be observed in 45.0% of the whole cohort: 65.7% in the PRBC transfusion group and 35.3% in the nontransfused group. Postoperative complications were significantly more common in the PRBC transfusion group in association with prolonged lengths of hospital stay and increased 30-day mortality than in the nontransfused group. After adjustment for possible confounders, preexisting kidney failure, preoperative hemoglobin and albumin levels outside of the reference range, intraoperative plasma transfusions, and overall surgery time were recognized as negative predictors for perioperative PRBC transfusions. PRBC transfusion increased the risk of death by approximately 38.8% (hazard ratio, 1.388; 95% CI, 1.027-1.876; P = .033), whereas no influence on recurrence-free survival (RFS) was observed.

238,CEUS in prediction of early recurrence of hepatocellular carcinoma after curative resection and to stratify the risk of early recurrence: a retrospective observational study.,Huang Z; Zhu RH; Li SS; Luo HC; Li KY,"PURPOSE: Early recurrence (ER) after surgery is related to early death in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) after radical resection. To explore the role of preoperative contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) in predicting ER of HCC after curative resection and to stratify the risk of ER. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This study evaluated consecutive 556 patients with HCC who were examined by CEUS during the 2 weeks before curative resection between January 2011 and December 2018. ER was defined as intrahepatic and/or extrahepatic recurrence within 2 year after resection of HCC. Univariate and logistic regression analyses were performed to identify independent risk factors for ER after surgical resection of HCC. Recurrence-free time (RFS) rates were analyzed and compared by log-rank test. RESULTS: ER occurred in 307 (55.2%) of the 556 patients. Univariate and multivariate analyses revealed that a tumor size ≥ 30 mm and satellite nodules seen on CEUS, DL(deep learning) radiomics reoccurrence score based on the frame of image with the maximum intensity of CEUS and an elevated alpha-fetoprotein level were significantly associated with ER (P < .05). Based on the number of predictors present, patients with CEUS LR-5 HCC were stratified into three risk subgroups: risk group 3 (high-risk patients, 4 predictors), risk group 2 (medium-risk patients, 2-3 predictors), and risk group 1 (low-risk patients, 0-1 predictor). The 2-year RFS rate was 19.4% in risk group 3, 40.9% in risk group 2, and 48.1% in risk group 1; the corresponding mean RFS times were 14.0 ± 2.9 months, 43.7 ± 6.6 months, and 55.5 ± 2.8 months, respectively (P < .001).

239,Image Quality and Diagnostic Performance of Low-Dose Liver CT with Deep Learning Reconstruction versus Standard-Dose CT.,Lee DH; Lee JM; Lee CH; Afat S; Othman A,"Purpose To compare the image quality and diagnostic capability in detecting malignant liver tumors of low-dose CT (LDCT, 33% dose) with deep learning-based denoising (DLD) and standard-dose CT (SDCT, 100% dose) with model-based iterative reconstruction (MBIR). Materials and Methods In this prospective, multicenter, noninferiority study, individuals referred for liver CT scans were enrolled from three tertiary referral hospitals between February 2021 and August 2022. All liver CT scans were conducted using a dual-source scanner with the dose split into tubes A (67% dose) and B (33% dose). Blended images from tubes A and B were created using MBIR to produce SDCT images, whereas LDCT images used data from tube B and were reconstructed with DLD. The noise in liver images was measured and compared between imaging techniques. The diagnostic performance of each technique in detecting malignant liver tumors was evaluated by three independent radiologists using jackknife alternative free-response receiver operating characteristic analysis. Noninferiority of LDCT compared with SDCT was declared when the lower limit of the 95% CI for the difference in figure of merit (FOM) was greater than -0.10. Results A total of 296 participants (196 men, 100 women; mean age, 60.5 years ± 13.3 [SD]) were included. The mean noise level in the liver was significantly lower for LDCT (10.1) compared with SDCT (10.7) (P < .001). Diagnostic performance was assessed in 246 participants (108 malignant tumors in 90 participants). The reader-averaged FOM was 0.880 for SDCT and 0.875 for LDCT (P = .35). The difference fell within the noninferiority margin (difference, -0.005 [95% CI: -0.024, 0.012]). Conclusion Compared with SDCT with MBIR, LDCT using 33% of the standard radiation dose had reduced image noise and comparable diagnostic performance in detecting malignant liver tumors.

240,Positive impact of obesity on the prognosis of liver cirrhosis.,Endo K; Kakisaka K; Abe T; Yusa K; Nakaya I; Watanabe T; Suzuki A; Yoshida Y; Oikawa T; Miyasaka A; Kuroda H; Matsumoto T,"BACKGROUND AND AIM: The study aims to determine the prognostic impact of obesity, sarcopenic obesity, and dynapenic obesity in patients with chronic liver disease. METHODS: This retrospective observational study enrolled patients with chronic hepatitis (n = 746) and liver cirrhosis (n = 434) without hepatocellular carcinoma at entry. The patients were evaluated for sarcopenia and obesity between April 2016 and April 2022. Obesity was defined as a body mass index of ≥ 25 kg/m(2). Sarcopenic obesity was defined as low skeletal muscle mass (pre-sarcopenia) with obesity and dynapenic obesity was defined as low muscle strength (dynapenia) with obesity. The effects of obesity on survival were evaluated retrospectively. RESULTS: The mean observation period was 2.5 years. Obesity, sarcopenic obesity, and dynapenic obesity were found in 271 (45.5%), 17 (2.9%), and 21 (3.5%) men, and 261 (44.7%), 59 (10.1%), and 53 (9.1%) women, respectively. A multivariate Cox proportional hazards model revealed that Child-Pugh class, dynapenia (hazard ratio [HR] 3.89), elderly (≥ 65 years old) (HR 2.11), and obesity (HR 0.58) were independently associated with overall survival (OS). However, neither sarcopenic nor dynapenic obesity were associated with OS. In patients with cirrhosis, the OS of the obese group was significantly higher than that of the non-obese group. The effect of obesity on OS was significant in elderly patients, but not in younger patients. CONCLUSIONS: Sarcopenic and dynapenic obesity seem unrelated to the prognosis of patients with chronic liver disease. Obesity has a positive effect on the prognosis of elderly patients with cirrhosis.

However, there is currently a lack of physical activity interventions specifically tailored for these patients. Therefore, we have developed a modular multimodal hospital-home chain physical activity rehabilitation programme (3M2H-PARP) designed specifically for patients with liver cancer undergoing transarterial chemoembolisation (TACE). We aim to validate the effectiveness and feasibility of this programme through a randomised controlled trial (RCT). METHODS AND ANALYSIS: 3M2H-PARP RCT will compare a 12-week, modular, multimodal physical activity rehabilitation programme that includes supervised exercise in a hospital setting and self-management exercise at home. The programmes consist of aerobic, resistance, flexibility and balance exercise modules, and standard survivorship care in a cohort of liver cancer survivors who have undergone TACE. The control group will receive standard care. A total of 152 participants will be randomly assigned to either the 3M2H-PARP group or the control group. Assessments will be conducted at three time points: baseline, after completing the intervention and a 24-week follow-up visit. The following variables will be evaluated: liver frailty index, Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Hepatobiliary subscale, Cancer Fatigue Scale, Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale and physical activity level. After the completion of the training programme, semi-structured interviews will be conducted with participants from the 3M2H-PARP group to investigate the programme's impact on their overall well-being. SPSS V.26.0 software will be used for statistical analyses. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Ethical approval has been granted by the Jiangnan University School of Medicine Research Ethics Committee.

242,"Contrast-enhanced ultrasonography-CT/MRI fusion guidance for percutaneous ablation of inconspicuous, small liver tumors: improving feasibility and therapeutic outcome.",Lee Y; Yoon JH; Han S; Joo I; Lee JM,"BACKGROUND: Percutaneous radiofrequency ablation (RFA) is pivotal for treating small malignant liver tumors, but tumors often remain inconspicuous on B-mode ultrasound (US). This study evaluates the potential of CEUS-CT/MRI fusion imaging (FI) to improve tumor visibility and the associated RFA outcomes for small (≤ 3 cm) malignant liver tumors that were inconspicuous on US. METHODS: Between January 2019 and April 2021, a prospective study enrolled 248 patients with liver malignancies (≤ 3 cm) that were poorly visible on B-mode US. Tumor visibility and ablation feasibility were assessed using B-mode US, US-CT/MRI FI, and CEUS-CT/MRI FI, and graded on a 4-point scale. CEUS was employed post-registration of US and CT/MRI images, utilizing either SonoVue or Sonazoid. Comparisons between US-based and CEUS-based fusion visibility and feasibility scores were undertaken using the Friedman test. Moreover, rates of technical success, technique efficacy, local tumor progression (LTP), and major complications were assessed. RESULTS: The cohort included 223 hepatocellular carcinomas (HCCs) (89.9%) and 23 metastases (9.3%), with an average tumor size of 1.6 cm. CEUS-CT/MRI FI demonstrated a significant advantage in tumor visibility (3.4 ± 0.7 vs. 1.9 ± 0.6, P < 0.001) and technical feasibility (3.6 ± 0.6 vs. 2.9 ± 0.8, P < 0.001) compared to US-FI. In 85.5% of patients, CEUS addition to US-FI ameliorated tumor visibility. Technical success was achieved in 99.6% of cases. No severe complications were reported. One and two-year post CEUS-CT/MRI FI-guided RFA estimates for LTP were 9.3% and 10.9%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: CEUS-CT/MRI FI significantly improves the visualization of tumors not discernible on B-mode US, thus augmenting percutaneous RFA success and delivering improved therapeutic outcomes.

STUDY DESIGN: Observational study. Place and Duration of the Study: Health Research Institute (HRI), National Institutes of Health (NIH), Islamabad, from 2015-2019. METHODOLOGY: Data from major cancer registries which included 'Punjab Cancer Registry (PCR), 'Karachi Cancer Registry (KCR)', 'Pakistan Atomic Energy Commission (PAEC) Cancer Registry', Armed Forces Institute of Pathology (AFIP) Cancer Registry, Nishtar Medical University Hospital Multan (NMH), and Shifa International Hospital, Islamabad (SIH) registries were pooled, cleared, and analysed at HRI. RESULTS: A total of 269,707 cancer cases were analysed. Gender-wise 46.7% were males and 53.61% were females. As per province-wise distribution, 45.13% of cases were from Punjab, 26.83% from Sindh, 16.46% from Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP), and 3.52% from Baluchistan. Both genders combined, 'breast cancer' 57633 (21.4%) was the most common cancer. In males, the top-5 cancers in order of frequency/percenatages were 'oral' 14477 (11.6%), 'liver' 8398 (6.73%), colorectal 8024 (6.43%), 'lung' 7547 (6.05%) and 'prostate' 7322 (5.87% cancers). In females, causes of the top-5-cancers included 'breast' 56250 (38.8%), 'ovary' 8823 (6.09%), 'oral' 7195 (4.97%), 'cervix' 6043 (4.17%), and 'colorectal' 4860 (3.36%) cancers. In children 'Leukemia' 1626 (14.50%) and in adolescents 'Bone' 880 (14%) were the leading malignancies. CONCLUSION: Breast cancer is the most common cancer in females touching epidemic proportions while 'oral cancer' which is the leading cancer in males ranks third in frequency in females. Like 'oral cancer' which shows a strong correlation with chewing, other common cancers in Pakistan including liver cancer, lung cancer, and cervical cancer are also largely preventable as showed a strong correlation with hepatitis B and C, smoking, and high-risk human papillomavirus.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Open-label, single-arm, exploratory clinical trial of apatinib combined with IMRT for uHCC patients. Patients aged 18-75 years with adequate hematological, liver, and renal functions and Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of ≤2 were enrolled in this study from March 2017 to September 2020. Patients were received IMRT (biological effective dose: 46-60 Gy) and continuous apatinib (250-500 mg/day) oral administration until HCC progression or unacceptable toxic effects. The endpoints included progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), disease control rate (DCR), objective response rate (ORR), and safety. The trial registration number is ChiCTR-OPC-17011890. RESULTS: A total of 33 patients have taken part in the study. The median age was 58 years old (range 32-77), 27 (81.9%) patients were ECOG PS 0-1, and 28 (84.9%) patients were male. In addition, 25 (75.7%) patients suffered from hepatitis B, 32 cases (97.0%) were in Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC) Stages B-C, and eight (24.2%) had portal vein involvement. Moreover, 12 (36.4%) and 21 (63.6%) patients received apatinib as first-line and second or later-line therapy, respectively. The average follow-up was 11.4 months, the median PFS was 7.8 months (95% confidence interval: 3.9-11.7). The OS rates at 6 and 12 months were 96.7% and 66.2%. The ORR and DCR were 15.1% and 81.8%, respectively. Hepatic toxicity was the most common treatment-related adverse events in Grades 3-4 (12.1%).

We investigated the feasibility of using super-resolution ultrasound (SR-US) imaging for visualizing and quantifying the microvasculature of intraparenchymal FLLs. METHODS: Patients with FLLs between June 2022 and February 2023 were prospectively screened. Following bolus injection of microbubbles at clinical concentration, SR-US was performed using a high frame rate (350-500 Hz) modified ultrasound scanner and a convex array transducer with a central frequency of 3.1 MHz. RESULTS: In total, 47 pathologically proven FLLs at a depth of 5.7 ± 1.7 cm (mean ± standard deviation) were included: 30 hepatocellular carcinomas (HCC), 11 liver metastases (LM), and 6 focal nodular hyperplasias (FNH). The smallest detectable vessel size of the hepatic microvasculature was 128.4 ± 18.6 μm (mean ± standard deviation) at a depth of 8 cm. Significant differences were observed among the three types of lesions in terms of pattern categories, vessel density, minimum flow velocity, and perfusion index. We observed higher vessel density for FNH versus liver parenchyma (p < 0.001) as well as fractal dimension and local flow direction entropy value for FNH versus HCC (p = 0.002 and p < 0.001, respectively) and for FNH versus LM (p = 0.006 and p = 0.002, respectively). CONCLUSION: Multiparametric SR-US showed that these three pathological types of FLLs have specific microvascular phenotypes. Vessel density, fractal dimension and local flow direction entropy served as valuable parameters in distinguishing between benign and malignant FLLs. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT06018142). RELEVANCE STATEMENT: Multiparametric SR-US imaging offers precise morphological and functional assessment of the microvasculature of intraparenchymal focal liver lesions, providing insights into tumor heterogeneity and angiogenesis. KEY POINTS: Super-resolution (SR)-US imaging allowed morphological and functional evaluation of intraparenchymal hepatic lesion microvasculature.

METHODS: In this retrospective multi-center study, treatment-naïve HBV-related decompensated patients were enrolled at first decompensating event of ascites and/or variceal bleeding. Further complications and clinical characteristics were collected using standard case report form every 6 months to year-5 of antiviral treatment. Recompensation was defined as maintaining free of decompensation for one year and achieving liver function within Child-Pugh A and/or MELD < 10. RESULTS: Totally, 170 (170/298, 57.0%) patients in ascites group of 298 (298/383, 77.8%) treatment-naïve decompensated patients and 33 (33/85, 38.8%) in bleeding group of 85 (85/383, 22.2%) patients, achieved recompensation. Ascites group had higher 5-year rate of recompensation than bleeding group (63.3% vs. 46.5%, p = 0.012), respectively. Patients achieving recompensation in ascites group maintained lower rate of second decompensation than these in bleeding group (at year-5: 26.7% vs. 43.3%, p = 0.032). Specifically, recompensated patients in ascites group had predominantly 5-year rate of further ascites (24.0%) and lower rate of further bleeding (6.0%), which differed from the pattern of these in bleeding group, with lower rate of further ascites (16.0%, p = 0.599) and significantly higher rate of further bleeding (33.9%, p < 0.001).

This study investigated the implications of serological incomplete conversion (SIC) of these 2 biomarkers as prognostic indicators for long-term outcomes after HCC resection. METHODS: A multicenter observational study was conducted on a cohort of HCC patients presenting with AFP (>20 ng/mL) or PIVKA-II (>40 mAU/mL) positivity who underwent curative-intent resection. Based on their postoperative AFP and PIVKA-II levels at first postoperative follow-up (4~8 weeks after surgery), these patients were stratified into the serological incomplete conversion (SIC) and serological complete conversion (SCC) groups. The study endpoints were recurrence and overall survival (OS). RESULTS: Among 1755 patients, 379 and 1376 were categorized as having SIC and SCC, respectively. The SIC group exhibited 1- and 5-year OS rates of 67.5% and 26.3%, with the corresponding recurrence rates of 53.2% and 79.0%, respectively; while the SCC group displayed 1- and 5-year OS rates of 95.8% and 62.5%, with the corresponding recurrence rates of 16.8% and 48.8%, respectively (both P < .001). Multivariate Cox regression analysis demonstrated that postoperative SIC was an independent risk factor for both increased recurrence (HR: 2.40, 95% CI, 2.04-2.81, P < .001) and decreased OS (HR: 2.69, 95% CI, 2.24-3.24, P < .001).

DESIGN: Between January 2013 and January 2020, 512 patients with HCC beyond the Milan criteria who underwent TACE after TIPS were retrospectively recruited from 15 tertiary centers. Patients were randomly sorted into a training set (n = 382) and a validation set (n = 130). Medical data and overall survival were assessed. A prediction model was developed using multivariate Cox regression analyses. Predictive performance and discrimination were evaluated and compared with other prognostic models. RESULTS: Vascular invasion, log(10)(AFP), 1/creatinine, extrahepatic spread, and log(10)(ALT) were the most significant prognostic factors of survival. These five parameters were included in a new VACEA score. This score was able to stratify patients in the training set into four distinct risk grades whose median overall survival were 25.2, 15.1, 8.9, and 6.2 months, respectively. The 6-month, 1-year, 2-year, and 3-year AUROC values and C-index of the VACEA model were 0.819, 0.806, 0.779, 0.825, and 0.735, respectively, and higher than those of other seven currently available models in both the training and validation sets, as well as in different subgroups. CONCLUSION: The VACEA score could stratify post-TIPS patients with HCC beyond the Milan criteria treated by TACE and help to identify candidates who benefit from this treatment. KEY POINTS: • Vascular invasion, AFP, creatinine, extrahepatic spread, and ALT were independent significant prognostic factors of survival for HCC patients who underwent TACE after TIPS. • Our new model, named VACEA score, can accurately predict prognosis at the individual level and stratify patients into four distinct risk grades. • The VACEA model showed better prognostic discrimination and calibration than other current TACE-/TIPS-specific models Graphical abstract.",False,Population and study design do not match the target criteria.,HCC patients beyond the Milan criteria treated by TACE after TIPS,transarterial chemoembolization,not specified,overall survival,retrospective study,False,Population matches but study design is not an RCT and lacks a control group,-,transarterial chemoembolization,-,overall survival,retrospective study,,No disagreement between Model A and B,False
249,A Comparative Trial of Improving Care for Underserved Asian Americans Infected with Hepatitis B Virus.,Ma GX; Zhu L; Tan Y; Zhai S; Ma X; Ogunwobi OO; Yang WJ; Ting T; Kim S; Wang MQ,"BACKGROUND: Hepatitis B virus (HBV) is the leading cause of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Asian Americans have the highest incidence and mortality rates of HCC among all US racial/ethnic groups. Inadequate monitoring and treatment of chronic hepatitis B contribute to poor health outcomes and increased healthcare costs among Asian Americans. AIMS: The goal of this study is to assess the effect of a patient-led strategy on chronic hepatitis B monitoring and treatment adherence specifically among Asian Americans with culturally tailored Patient Navigator-led Intervention. METHODS: From 2015 to 2018, 532 eligible participants living with chronic hepatitis B in the greater Philadelphia and New York city metropolitan areas were randomly assigned to either the intervention group or the control group. Generalized linear mixed-effects models were used to estimate the odds ratio (OR) for rates of doctor visits for chronic hepatitis B and rates of alanine aminotransferase testing for evidence of liver damage. RESULTS: Intervention group had higher rates of doctor visits than the control group at both 6-month (77.22% vs. 45.75%) and 12-month assessments (90.73% vs. 60.61%). Significantly more intervention group participants received ALT testing than control group participants at 6-month (52.90% vs. 25.10%) and 12-month (75.40% vs. 46.75%) follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: Culturally and linguistically appropriate intervention has strong effects on adherence to follow-up care among Asian American hepatitis B patients experiencing challenges to medication adherence and follow up care. These findings further identify opportunities for practical implementation of evidence-based intervention that could lead to reductions in disparities in chronic liver disease and liver cancer among high-risk, underserved populations.

Low-energy electromagnetic fields (EMFs) can influence cell biological processes via non-thermal effects and may represent a new treatment option. METHODS: This single-site feasibility trial enrolled patients with advanced HCC, Child-Pugh A and B, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group 0-2. Patients underwent 90-min amplitude-modulated EMF exposure procedures every 2-4 weeks, using the AutEMdev (Autem Therapeutics). Patients could also receive standard care. The primary endpoints were safety and the identification of hemodynamic variability patterns. Exploratory endpoints included health-related quality of life (HRQoL), overall survival (OS). and objective response rate (ORR) using RECIST v1.1. RESULTS: Sixty-six patients with advanced HCC received 539 AutEMdev procedures (median follow-up, 30 months). No serious adverse events occurred during procedures. Self-limiting grade 1 somnolence occurred in 78.7% of patients. Hemodynamic variability during EMF exposure was associated with specific amplitude-modulation frequencies. HRQoL was maintained or improved among patients remaining on treatment. Median OS was 11.3 months (95% confidence interval [CI]: 6.0, 16.6) overall (16.0 months [95% CI: 4.4, 27.6] and 12.0 months [6.4, 17.6] for combination therapy and monotherapy, respectively). ORR was 24.3% (32% and 17% for combination therapy and monotherapy, respectively). CONCLUSION: AutEMdev EMF exposure has an excellent safety profile in patients with advanced HCC.

A multicenter, retrospective, and observational study was conducted. During the overall follow-up of 5 years, HCC patients who had curative resection were monitored every 3 months in the first year post-surgery and every 6 months thereafter if no recurrence occurred. Tumor markers were collected at the diagnosis of recurrence for those with recurrence and at the last follow-up for those without recurrence. The median serum levels of PIVKA-II and AFP in the recurrence group were significantly higher than those in the non-recurrence group (PIVKA-II: 84.62 vs. 18.76 mAU/ml, p < 0.001; AFP: 4.90 vs. 3.00 ng/ml, p < 0.001) and there is a significant correlation between PIVKA-II and AFP (R = 0.901, p < 0.001). PIVKA-II showed better accuracy than AFP in the diagnosis of overall recurrent HCC (AUC: 0.883 vs. 0.672; p < 0.0001), but also in patients with negative PIVKA-II before curative resection (AUC: 0.878 vs. 0.680, p = 0.001).

253,Nomogram based on liver stiffness and spleen area with ultrasound for posthepatectomy liver failure: A multicenter study.,Cheng GW; Fang Y; Xue LY; Zhang Y; Xie XY; Qiao XH; Li XQ; Guo J; Ding H,"BACKGROUND: Liver stiffness (LS) measurement with two-dimensional shear wave elastography (2D-SWE) correlates with the degree of liver fibrosis and thus indirectly reflects liver function reserve. The size of the spleen increases due to tissue proliferation, fibrosis, and portal vein congestion, which can indirectly reflect the situation of liver fibrosis/cirrhosis. It was reported that the size of the spleen was related to posthepatectomy liver failure (PHLF). So far, there has been no study combining 2D-SWE measurements of LS with spleen size to predict PHLF. This prospective study aimed to investigate the utility of 2D-SWE assessing LS and spleen area (SPA) for the prediction of PHLF in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients and to develop a risk prediction model. AIM: To investigate the utility of 2D-SWE assessing LS and SPA for the prediction of PHLF in HCC patients and to develop a risk prediction model. METHODS: This was a multicenter observational study prospectively analyzing patients who underwent hepatectomy from October 2020 to March 2022. Within 1 wk before partial hepatectomy, ultrasound examination was performed to measure LS and SPA, and blood was drawn to evaluate the patient's liver function and other conditions. Least absolute shrinkage and selection operator logistic regression and multivariate logistic regression analysis was applied to identify independent predictors of PHLF and develop a nomogram. Nomogram performance was validated further. The diagnostic performance of the nomogram was evaluated with receiver operating characteristic curve compared with the conventional models, including the model for end-stage liver disease (MELD) score and the albumin-bilirubin (ALBI) score. RESULTS: A total of 562 HCC patients undergoing hepatectomy (500 in the training cohort and 62 in the validation cohort) were enrolled in this study. The independent predictors of PHLF were LS, SPA, range of resection, blood loss, international normalized ratio, and total bilirubin. Better diagnostic performance of the nomogram was obtained in the training [area under receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC): 0.833; 95% confidence interval (95%CI): 0.792-0.873; sensitivity: 83.1%; specificity: 73.5%] and validation (AUC: 0.802; 95%CI: 0.684-0.920; sensitivity: 95.5%; specificity: 52.5%) cohorts compared with the MELD score and the ALBI score. CONCLUSION: This PHLF nomogram, mainly based on LS by 2D-SWE and SPA, was useful in predicting PHLF in HCC patients and presented better than MELD score and ALBI score. reserved.",False,"Population matches, but intervention, comparison, and outcomes do not match the target criteria, and study design is not a randomized controlled trial.",HCC patients undergoing hepatectomy,2D-SWE assessing LS and spleen area (SPA),not specified,prediction of posthepatectomy liver failure (PHLF),multicenter observational study,False,"Intervention and outcomes do not match target criteria.

Currently, sorafenib is the treatment of choice in advanced hepatocarcinoma. AIMS: Assessing the effectiveness and toxicity of sorafenib in real-word clinical practice in patients with hepatocarcinoma. SETTINGS AND DESIGN: Single-centered observational retrospective study. METHODS AND MATERIAL: We included patients with hepatocarcinoma who began treatment with sorafenib between 2008 and 2018. We evaluated overall survival, time to progression, and response using RECIST (Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors) criteria. Toxicity was assessed according to the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 5. 2020. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS USED: Kaplan-Meier curves and the log-rank test were used to determine the survival time and estimate factors associated with these events. Data were analyzed with SPSS 19.0 software. RESULTS: We included 36 patients (88.9% male) with an average age of 64 ± 3.4 years. The tumor stage was advanced (C) in 21 patients (61.8%). We obtained a median overall survival of 8.5 months (IQR 3.14-18.9) and a time to progression of 4.5 months (IQR 2.4-8.8). The main degree of response was progression in 19 patients (36.1%), followed by stable disease in 13 (52.8%). The most commonly reported adverse reactions were: constitutional (83.3%), gastrointestinal (55%) and dermatological symptoms (50.0%).

255,Efficacy and safety of SBRT combined with sintilimab and IBI305 in patients with advanced HCC and previously failed immunotherapy: study protocol of a phase 2 clinical trial.,Zhang J; Yang Y; Wu Z; Zhang S; Lin Z; Liu H; Hu J; Zhang T; Tang J; Xue J,"INTRODUCTION: Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a leading cause of cancer-related death in China. The combination of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) and antiangiogenic drugs, such as bevacizumab and tyrosine kinase inhibitors, has been recommended as first-line treatment for advanced HCC. However, two-thirds of patients did not benefit from this form of immunotherapy. Currently, data on the subsequent regimen for patients previously treated with ICIs are lacking. Studies have shown that the combination of radiotherapy (RT) and ICIs is a potentially effective second-line therapy for HCC. This study aims to assess the efficacy and safety of combined therapy with stereotactic body RT (SBRT), sintilimab and IBI305 (a biosimilar of bevacizumab) in patients with HCC following the progression of first-line ICI therapy. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: This study is an open-label, single-arm, single-centre, phase 2 trial of 21 patients with advanced HCC in whom previous ICI therapy has failed. Participants will receive approximately 30-40 Gy/5-8F SBRT, followed by 200 mg sintilimab and 15 mg/kg IBI305 intravenously every 3 weeks. Treatment will continue until the development of unacceptable toxicity or disease progression. We will use Simon's two-stage design, with the objective response rate (ORR) as the primary endpoint. Secondary endpoints include ORR of lesions without RT, disease control rate, progression-free survival, overall survival and safety.

256,Concordance of a decision algorithm and multidisciplinary team meetings for patients with liver cancer-a study protocol for a randomized controlled trial.,Ng SST; Oehring R; Ramasetti N; Roller R; Thomas P; Chen Y; Moosburner S; Winter A; Maurer MM; Auer TA; Kamali C; Pratschke J; Benzing C; Krenzien F,"INTRODUCTION: Multidisciplinary team meetings (MDMs), also known as tumor conferences, are a cornerstone of cancer treatments. However, barriers such as incomplete patient information or logistical challenges can postpone tumor board decisions and delay patient treatment, potentially affecting clinical outcomes. Therapeutic Assistance and Decision algorithms for hepatobiliary tumor Boards (ADBoard) aims to reduce this delay by providing automated data extraction and high-quality, evidence-based treatment recommendations. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: With the help of natural language processing, relevant patient information will be automatically extracted from electronic medical records and used to complete a classic tumor conference protocol. A machine learning model is trained on retrospective MDM data and clinical guidelines to recommend treatment options for patients in our inclusion criteria. Study participants will be randomized to either MDM with ADBoard (Arm A: MDM-AB) or conventional MDM (Arm B: MDM-C). The concordance of recommendations of both groups will be compared using interrater reliability. We hypothesize that the therapy recommendations of ADBoard would be in high agreement with those of the MDM-C, with a Cohen's kappa value of ≥ 0.75. Furthermore, our secondary hypotheses state that the completeness of patient information presented in MDM is higher when using ADBoard than without, and the explainability of tumor board protocols in MDM-AB is higher compared to MDM-C as measured by the System Causability Scale. DISCUSSION: The implementation of ADBoard aims to improve the quality and completeness of the data required for MDM decision-making and to propose therapeutic recommendations that consider current medical evidence and guidelines in a transparent and reproducible manner.

METHODS: The retrospective study was conducted on 112 unresectable HCC patients who underwent pretherapeutic MRI examinations. Patients were randomly divided into training (n = 79) and validation cohorts (n = 33). A total of 396 radiomics features were extracted from the volume of interest of the primary lesion by the Artificial Kit software. The least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression was applied to identify optimal radiomic features. After feature selection, three models, including the clinical, radiomics, and combined models, were developed to predict the non-response of unresectable HCC to HAIC treatment. The performance of these models was evaluated by the receiver operating characteristic curve. According to the most efficient model, a nomogram was established, and the performance of which was also assessed by calibration curve and decision curve analysis. Kaplan-Meier curve and log-rank test were performed to evaluate the Progression-free survival (PFS). RESULTS: Using the LASSO regression, we ultimately selected three radiomics features from T2-weighted images to construct the radiomics score (Radscore). Only the ALBI score was an independent factor associated with non-response in the clinical model (P = 0.033). The combined model, which included the ALBI score and Radscore, achieved better performance in the prediction of non-response, with an AUC of 0.79 (95% CI 0.68-0.90) and 0.75 (95% CI 0.58-0.92) in the training and validation cohorts, respectively. The nomogram based on the combined model also had good discrimination and calibration (P = 0.519 for the training cohort and P = 0.389 for the validation cohort). The Kaplan-Meier analysis also demonstrate that the high-score patients had significantly shorter PFS than the low-score patients (P = 0.031) in the combined model, with median PFS 6.0 vs 9.0 months. CONCLUSION: The nomogram based on the combined model consisting of MRI radiomics and ALBI score could be used as a biomarker to predict the therapeutic response of unresectable HCC after HAIC.",False,"Population matches, but intervention is not immunotherapy or targeted therapy, comparison is not specified, and study design is not a randomized controlled trial.",unresectable HCC patients,hepatic arterial infusion chemotherapy (HAIC),not specified,"therapeutic response, Progression-free survival (PFS)",retrospective study,False,"Intervention is hepatic arterial infusion chemotherapy, not immunotherapy or targeted therapy.

258,Model-Informed Assessment of Probability of Phase 3 Success for Ritlecitinib in Patients with Moderate-to-Severe Ulcerative Colitis.,Wojciechowski J; Mukherjee A; Banfield C; Nicholas T,"Ritlecitinib, an oral Janus kinase 3/tyrosine kinase expressed in hepatocellular carcinoma family inhibitor, was evaluated in patients with ulcerative colitis (UC) in a phase 2b trial. Model-informed drug development strategies were applied to bridge observations from phase 2b to predictions for a proposed phase 3 study design to assess the probability of achieving the target efficacy outcome. A longitudinal exposure-response model of the time course of the 4 Mayo subscores (rectal bleeding, stool frequency, physician's global assessment, and endoscopic subscore) in patients with UC receiving placebo or ritlecitinib was developed using population modeling approaches and an item response theory framework. The quantitative relationships between the 4 Mayo subscores accommodated the prediction of composite endpoints such as total Mayo score and partial Mayo score (key endpoints from phase 2b), and modified clinical remission and endoscopic remission (proposed phase 3 endpoints). Clinical trial simulations using the final model assessed the probability of candidate ritlecitinib dosing regimens (including those tested in phase 2b and alternative) and phase 3 study designs for achieving target efficacy outcomes benchmarked against an approved treatment for moderate-to-severe UC. The probabilities of achieving target modified clinical remission and endoscopic improvement outcomes at both weeks 8 and 52 for ritlecitinib 100 mg once daily was 74.8%.

Augmented reality navigation (ARN) and fluorescence imaging are currently safe and reproducible techniques for hepatectomy, but the efficacy results for centrally located hepatocellular carcinoma have not been reported. This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy of an ARN system combined with fluorescence imaging (ARN-FI) in laparoscopic hepatectomy for centrally located hepatocellular carcinoma. STUDY DESIGN: This was a post hoc analysis of an original nonrandomized clinical trial that was designed to evaluate the feasibility and efficacy of ARN-FI for laparoscopic liver resection. A total of 76 patients were consecutively enrolled from June 2018 to June 2021, of which 42 underwent laparoscopic hepatectomy using ARN-FI (ARN-FI group), and the other 34 who did not use ARN-FI guidance (non-ARN-FI group). Perioperative outcomes and disease-free survival were compared between the 2 groups. RESULTS: Compared with the non-ARN-FI group, the ARN-FI group had less intraoperative blood loss (median 275 vs 300 mL, p = 0.013), lower intraoperative transfusion rate (14.3% vs 64.7%, p < 0.01), shorter postoperative hospital stay (median 8 vs 9 days, p = 0.005), and lower postoperative complication rate (35.7% vs 61.8%, p = 0.024). There was no death in the perioperative period and follow-up period. There was no significant difference in overall disease-free survival between the 2 groups (p = 0.16).

Transarterial chemoembolization combined with programmed cell death protein-1 inhibitors and lenvatinib has also shown preliminary efficacy in the unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma. We conducted this observational, retrospective, cohort study to compare the clinical outcomes and safety of transarterial chemoembolization combined with programmed cell death protein-1 inhibitors plus lenvatinib versus programmed cell death protein-1 inhibitors plus lenvatinib in patients with unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma. Methods: Between November 2019 and November 2021, patients who were diagnosed with unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma and received transarterial chemoembolization combined with programmed cell death protein-1 inhibitors plus lenvatinib or programmed cell death protein-1 inhibitors plus lenvatinib treatment were reviewed for eligibility. The primary endpoints included objective response rate, overall survival, and progression-free survival. The secondary endpoint was the frequency of key adverse events. Results: In total, 105 patients were eligible for the present study, and they were divided into the transarterial chemoembolization combined with programmed cell death protein-1 inhibitors plus lenvatinib group (n = 46) and the programmed cell death protein-1 inhibitors plus lenvatinib group (n = 59). The patient cohort after a one-to-one propensity score matching (n = 86) was also analyzed. The transarterial chemoembolization combined with programmed cell death protein-1 inhibitors plus lenvatinib group had a higher objective response rate both in the patient cohort before propensity score matching (54.3% vs 25.4%, P = .002) and after propensity score matching (55.8% vs 30.2%, P = .017). The patients in the transarterial chemoembolization combined with programmed cell death protein-1 inhibitors plus lenvatinib group had prolonged overall survival (median, 20.5 vs 12.6 months, P = .015) and progression-free survival (median, 10.2 vs 7.4 months, P = .035). For patient cohort- propensity score matching, the overall survival (20.5 vs 12.8 months, P = .013) and progression-free survival (12.1 vs 7.8 months, P = .030) were also significantly better in the transarterial chemoembolization combined with programmed cell death protein-1 inhibitors plus lenvatinib group than in the programmed cell death protein-1 inhibitors plus lenvatinib group. There were no significant differences between the 2 groups concerning adverse reactions caused by immunotherapy and lenvatinib. The adverse reactions caused by transarterial chemoembolization were transient and were quickly reversed.

METHODS: We conducted a three-center observational retrospective study of patients with advanced digestive tract cancer who received programmed death-1 (PD-1) inhibitors plus antiangiogenic agents between March 2019 and July 2022 in China. The patients had one of the three types of primary tumors: hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), colorectal cancer (CRC), and gastric cancer (GC). RESULTS: The study included 352 patients. The most frequently prescribed co-medications were nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) (46.3%), proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) (38.0%), systemic antibiotics (33.8%), and corticosteroids (30.1%). Probiotics had a direct correlation with a higher objective response rate (ORR) (OR 2.4, 95% CI 1.2 to 4.7, p = 0.013). Patients who received PPIs for gastritis/gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) (HR 0.7, 95% CI 0.5 to 1.0, p = 0.045), anticoagulants (HR 0.5, 95% CI 0.3 to 0.9, p = 0.009), and probiotics (HR 0.7, 95% CI 0.5 to 1.0, p = 0.034) had longer progression-free survival (PFS). Patients who received PPIs for gastritis/GERD (HR 0.6, 95% CI 0.4 to 0.9; p = 0.009) had longer overall survival (OS), while patients receiving opioids (HR 1.5, 95% CI 1.1 to 2.0, p = 0.010) had a significantly higher risk of death. CONCLUSION: Patients with advanced digestive tract cancer who were administered PPIs for gastritis/GERD indication, anticoagulants, or probiotics in combination with PD-1 inhibitors and antiangiogenic agents experienced improved clinical outcomes.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: This study reviewed the clinical characteristics and preoperative CT images of 143 cHCC-CC patients who underwent radical resection from three institutions. A total of 110 patients from institution 1 were randomly divided into training set (n = 78) and testing set (n = 32) in the ratio of 7-3. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analysis were used to construct a nomogram prediction model in the training set, which was internally and externally validated in the testing set and the validation set (n = 33) from institutions 2 and 3. The area under the curve (AUC) of receiver operating characteristics (ROC), decision curve analysis (DCA), and calibration analysis were used to evaluate the model's performance. RESULTS: The combined model demonstrated superior predictive performance compared to the clinical model, the CT model, the pathological model and the clinic-CT model in predicting the early postoperative recurrence. The nomogram based on the combined model included AST, ALP, tumor size, tumor margin, arterial phase peritumoral enhancement, and MVI (Microvascular invasion).

CheckMate 040 is an open-label, multicohort, phase I/II trial in adults with advanced HCC that evaluated nivolumab monotherapy (0.1-10 mg/kg once every 2 weeks [q2w]) and the following three combinations of nivolumab plus ipilimumab: (1) nivolumab 1 mg/kg plus ipilimumab 3 mg/kg every 3 weeks (q3w) for four doses, followed by nivolumab monotherapy 240 mg q2w (arm A); (2) nivolumab 3 mg/kg plus ipilimumab 1 mg/kg q3w for four doses, followed by nivolumab monotherapy 240 mg q2w (arm B); and (3) nivolumab 3 mg/kg q2w plus ipilimumab 1 mg/kg every 6 weeks continuously (arm C). Exposure-response relationships (efficacy and safety) were characterized using nivolumab and ipilimumab concentrations after the first dose (Cavg1) as the exposure measure. Objective tumor response (OTR) and overall survival (OS) improvements were associated with increased ipilimumab exposure (OTR: odds ratio 1.45, 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.13-1.86; OS: hazard ratio 0.86, 95% CI 0.75-0.98), but not nivolumab exposure (OTR: odds ratio 0.99, 95% CI 0.97-1.02; OS: hazard ratio 1.08, 95% CI 0.89-1.32).

METHODS: A multicenter, randomized controlled trial was conducted in patients with high-risk recurrence factors after curative resection of HCC from 9 medical centers between July 2014 and July 2018. Totally 249 patients were randomly assigned to TACE with or without Cidan Capsule administration groups by stratified block in a 1:1 ratio. Postoperative adjuvant TACE was given 4-5 weeks after hepatic resection in both groups. Additionally, 125 patients in the TACE plus Cidan group were administrated Cidan Capsule (0.27 g/capsule, 5 capsules every time, 4 times a day) for 6 months with a 24-month follow-up. Primary endpoints included disease-free survival (DFS) and tumor recurrence rate (TRR). Secondary endpoint was overall survival (OS). Any drug-related adverse events (AEs) were observed and recorded. RESULTS: As the data cutoff in July 9th, 2018, the median DFS was not reached in the TACE plus Cidan group and 234.0 days in the TACE group (hazard ratio, 0.420, 95% confidence interval, 0.290-0.608; P<0.01). The 1- and 2-year TRR in the TACE plus Cidan and TACE groups were 31.5%, 37.1%, and 60.8%, 63.4%, respectively (P<0.01). Median OS was not reached in both groups. The 1- and 2-year OS rates in TACE plus Cidan and TACE groups were 98.4%, 98.4%, and 89.5%, 87.9%, respectively (P<0.05). The most common grade 3-4 AEs included fatigue, abdominal pain, lumbar pain, and nausea. One serious AE was reported in 1 patient in the TACE plus Cidan group, the death was due to retroperitoneal mass hemorrhage and hemorrhagic shock, and was not related to study drug. CONCLUSIONS: Cidan Capsule in combination with TACE can reduce the incidence of early recurrence in HCC patients at high-risk of recurrence after radical hepatectomy and may be an appropriate option in postoperative anti-recurrence treatment.

This phase 1b/2 study was designed to determine the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) of GT90001 plus nivolumab, and assess the safety and anti-tumor activity in patients with advanced HCC. METHODS: Patients with advanced HCC were recruited from 3 centers. Eligible patients in the dose de-escalation stage received the GT90001 on day 1 of a 14-day cycle in a rolling-six design with a fixed dose of nivolumab (3.0 mg/kg). Patients in dose-expansion stage received the RP2D of GT90001 plus nivolumab. Primary endpoint was safety. Key secondary endpoint was objective response rate (ORR) as per RECIST 1.1. RESULTS: Between July 9, 2019, and August 8, 2022, 20 patients were treated (6 in phase 1b; 14 in phase 2) and evaluable for analysis. In phase 1b, no dose-limiting toxicities were observed, and GT90001 7.0 mg/kg was confirmed as the RP2D. Common grade 3/4 adverse events (AEs) were platelet count decreased (15%). No deaths due to AEs were reported. Confirmed ORR and disease control rate were 30% (95% CI, 14.6%-51.9%) and 40% (95% CI, 21.9%-61.3%), respectively. Median duration of response was not calculated (95% CI, 7.39 months to not calculated).

We studied the safety and immunogenicity of a novel therapeutic hepatitis C virus (HCV) genotype 1a/1b consensus DNA vaccine, INO-8000, encoding HCV NS3, NS4A, NS4B, and NS5A proteins alone or co-administered with DNA-encoding IL12 (INO-9012), a human cytokine that stimulates cellular immune function, in individuals with chronic hepatitis C. This was a phase I, multisite dose-escalation trial with an expansion cohort evaluating doses of 0, 0.3, 1.0, and 3.0 mg of INO-9012 (IL12 DNA) as an addition to 6.0 mg of (INO-8000; HCV DNA vaccine). Vaccines were administered by intramuscular injection followed by electroporation at study entry and at weeks 4, 12, and 24. HCV-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell immune responses were measured by IFNγ ELISpot and flow cytometry-based assays. Transient, mild-to-moderate injection site reactions unrelated to IL12 DNA dose were common. Increases in HCV-specific IFNγ production occurred in 15/20 (75%) participants. Increases in the frequency of HCV-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cells occurred at all dose levels, with the greatest increases seen at 1.0 mg of INO-9012. HCV-specific CD8+ and CD4+ T-cell activities increased in 16/18 (89%) and 14/17 (82%) participants with available data, respectively. The vaccine regimen was safe and induced HCV-specific CD4+ and CD8+ cellular immune responses of modest magnitude in most HCV-infected participants. The addition of 1.0 mg of IL12 DNA provided the best enhancement of immune responses. The vaccine regimen had little effect on controlling HCV viremia. PREVENTION RELEVANCE: The administration of IL12 DNA along with a hepatitis C viral antigen DNA vaccine enhanced the HCV-specific immune responses induced by the vaccine in individuals with chronic hepatitis C, an important cause of hepatocellular carcinoma.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 90 patients were divided into DEB-TACE group (n = 45) and cTACE group (n = 45). The treatment response, overall survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS), and the safety were compared between the two groups. RESULTS: The objective response rate (ORR) in the DEB-TACE group was significantly higher than that in cTACE group at 1, 3, and 6 months of follow-up (P = 0.031, P = 0.003, P = 0.002). The complete response (CR) in DEB-TACE group was significantly higher than that in cTACE group at 3 months (P = 0.036). Survival analysis revealed that, DEB-TACE group had better survival benefits than cTACE group (median OS: 534 days vs. 367 days, P = 0.027; median PFS: 352 days vs. 278 days P = 0.004). The degree of liver function injury was more serious in DEB-TACE group at 1 week, but was similar between the two groups at 1 month. DEB-TACE with CSM caused a high incidence of fever and a severe abdominal pain (P = 0.031, P = 0.037). CONCLUSIONS: DEB-TACE with CSM showed better treatment response and survival benefits than cTACE group. Although a transient more severe liver damage, high incidence of fever and a severe abdominal pain occurred in the DEB-TACE group, it could be resolved through symptomatic treatment.

AIM: To investigate the effects of high-intensity interval training (HIIT) and iranian propolis extract on serum levels of transient receptor potential cation channel subfamily V member 4 (TRPV4) and cytochrome P450 2E1 (CYP2E1) proteins in patients with NAFLD. METHODS: Thirty-two patients with NAFLD (mean±standard deviation of age: 45.1±3.6 years; body mass index: 30.0±3.6 kg/m2) were assigned in a randomized control trial to one of the following groups: HIIT (n=8), propolis supplement (n=8), propolis + HIIT (n=8), and controls (n=8). The subjects participated in eight weeks of HIIT (one bout of 1-min intervals at 80-95% of the maximal heart-rate, interspersed by two min at 50-55% of the reserve heart-rate). The Propolis supplement was taken three times a day by the patients in the form of 50 mg tablet after the main meals. Body composition, liver injury test (eg; Alanine- and Aspartate- aminotransferase levels), liver ultrasound and serum levels of TRPV4 and CYP2E1 were measured before and after intervention. One-way analysis of variance was used to compare post-tests among the groups. RESULTS: HIIT significantly reduced serum levels of TRPV4 protein (p=0.001). The reduction in CYP2E1 was not significant in HIIT group (p=0.075). Propolis consumption had no significant effect on serum levels of CYP2E1 protein (p=0.059), and TRPV4 (p=0.072). There was a significant decrease in TRPV4 and CYP2E1 in the HIIT (p=0.001) and propolis supplement (p=0.032) groups.

Real-world patterns of recurrence and the prognostic significance of early recurrence in U.S. clinical practice have not been well characterized. METHODS: This retrospective observational study was designed to evaluate the impact of recurrence on overall survival (OS) among patients with HCC following initial curative-intent resection or ablation. We used the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results cancer registry linked with Medicare claims (January 1, 2010-December 31, 2019). Eligible patients (≥66 years) diagnosed with HCC (2010-2017) had liver resection or ablation within 180 days of diagnosis. Patients were stratified by recurrence status using diagnosis- and treatment-based definitions of recurrence. Early or late recurrence was defined as within 1 year or after 1 year, respectively. Adjusted OS analyses used multivariable Cox regression models. RESULTS: A total of 1,146 patients were included. During a median overall follow-up of 35.2 months, 736 (64%) patients had a recurrence, of whom 380 (52%) had early recurrence (within 1 year). In the adjusted analysis, patients with recurrence had a 2.24-fold higher risk of death (95% confidence interval 1.85, 2.71; P < 0.001). Patients with early recurrence had a 1.39-fold higher risk of death (95% confidence interval 1.14, 1.68; P < 0.001) than those with late recurrence.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 87 patients aged 18-75 years with at least one measurable lesion per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (version 1.1) were included in the study. TACE was administered as needed, and camrelizumab and TKI medication were initiated within two weeks and one week after TACE, respectively. The primary endpoints were progression-free survival and objective response rate. RESULTS: The 87 patients in this trial were last evaluated on September 28, 2022, and 35.8% were still receiving treatment at the data cutoff. A total of 34 patients (39.1%) died, and the median OS was not reached. The median PFS was 10.5 months (95% CI: 7.8-13.1). The ORR rate was 71.3% (62/87), and the DCR rate was 89.7% (78/87) per mRECIST. According to RECIST version 1.1, the ORR rate was 35.6% (31/87), and the DCR rate was 87.4% (76/87). Ten patients (11.5%) successfully underwent conversion therapy and all achieved R0 resection. Two patients achieved a complete pathological response, four achieved a major pathological response, and four had a partial response. All treatment-related adverse events were tolerated.

However, evidence on the efficacy and safety of the novel treatment standard in patients with prior exposure to systemic treatment is scarce. The aim of this global, multicenter, observational study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of AB in patients after previous systemic therapy. METHODS: We screened our global, multicenter, prospectively maintained registry database for patients who received any systemic therapy before AB. The primary end point was overall survival; secondary end points were time-to-progression, progression-free survival, objective response rate, and safety (rate and severity of adverse events). RESULTS: Among 493 patients who received AB for unresectable HCC, 61 patients received prior systemic therapy and were included in this analysis. The median age of the study population was 66 years, with 91.8% males. Predominant risk factors for HCC were viral hepatitis (59%) and alcohol (23%). Overall survival for AB was 16.2 (95% CI, 14.5-17.9) months, time-to-progression and progression-free survival were 4.1 (95% CI, 1.5-6.6) and 3.1 (95% CI, 1.1-5.1) months, respectively. The objective response rate was 38.2% (7.3% with complete and 30.9% with partial response).

To explore phosphatase and tension homolog (PTEN) as a biomarker for proteasome inhibition in ICC, we conducted a phase II trial to assess the second-line efficacy of bortezomib in PTEN-deficient advanced ICC patients. METHODS: A total of 130 patients with advanced ICC in our centre were screened by PTEN immunohistochemical staining between 1 July 2017, and 31 December 2021, and 16 patients were ultimately enrolled and treated with single-agent bortezomib 1.3 mg/m(2) on days 1, 4, 8 and 11 of a 21-day cycle. The primary endpoint was the objective response rate (ORR) according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors v1.1. RESULTS: The median follow-up was 6.55 months (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.7-19.9 months). Among the 16 enrolled patients, the ORR was 18.75% (3/16) and the disease control rate was 43.75% (7/16). The median progress-free survival was 2.95 months (95% CI: 2.1-5.1 months) and the median overall survival (mOS) was 7.2 months (95% CI: 0.7-21.6 months) in the intent-to-treat-patients. Treatment-related adverse events of any grade were reported in 16 patients, with thrombopenia being the most common toxicity. Patients with PTEN staining scores of 0 were more likely to benefit from bortezomib than those with staining scores > 0. CONCLUSIONS: Bortezomib yielded an encouraging objective response and a favourable OS as a second-line agent in PTEN-deficient ICC patients. Our findings suggest bortezomib as a promising therapeutic option for patients with PTEN-deficient ICC. HIGHLIGHTS: There is a limited strategy for the second-line option of intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC). This investigator-initiated phase 2 study evaluated bortezomib in ICC patients with phosphatase and tension homology deficiency.

We investigated the dose-response relationship between alcohol consumption and the risk of HCC according to glycemic status. METHODS AND FINDINGS: This population-based observational cohort study included patients who underwent general health checkups in 2009 using the Korean National Health Insurance Service Database. The primary outcome was HCC incidence, and Cox proportional hazard regression analysis was performed to estimate the relationship between alcohol consumption and HCC risk according to glycemic status. A total of 34,321 patients newly diagnosed with HCC were observed in the median follow-up period of 8.3 years. In the multivariable model, we adjusted for age, sex, smoking, regular exercise, income, hypertension, dyslipidemia, and body mass index. Mild-to-moderate alcohol consumption increased the risk of HCC in all glycemic statuses (normoglycemia: hazard ratio [HR], 1.06; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.02 to 1.10; prediabetes: HR, 1.19; 95% CI, 1.14 to 1.24; and diabetes: HR, 2.02; 95% CI, 1.93 to 2.11) compared to normoglycemic nondrinking. Heavy alcohol consumption also increased the risk of HCC in all glycemic statuses (normoglycemia: HR, 1.39; 95% CI, 1.32 to 1.46; prediabetes: HR, 1.67; 95% CI, 1.58 to 1.77; and diabetes: HR, 3.29; 95% CI, 3.11 to 3.49) compared to normoglycemic nondrinking. Since alcohol consumption information in this study was based on a self-administered questionnaire, there may be a possibility of underestimation. Although we excluded patients with a history of viral hepatitis using diagnosis codes, we could not obtain information on hepatitis B or hepatitis C serum markers. CONCLUSIONS: Both mild-to-moderate and heavy alcohol consumption was associated with an increased risk of HCC in all glycemic statuses. The increased risk of HCC according to alcohol consumption was the highest in the diabetes group, suggesting that more intensive alcohol abstinence is required for patients with diabetes. terms of the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original author and source are credited.",False,"Intervention and outcome do not match, and not a randomized controlled trial.",patients with hepatocellular carcinoma,alcohol consumption,glycemic status,HCC incidence,population-based observational cohort study,False,"Intervention and outcome do not match, and not a randomized controlled trial",-,-,-,-,-,,No disagreement between Model A and B,False

DESIGN: Prospective, double blinded, randomized controlled trial. SETTING: A single tertiary care center from November 2021 and January 2023. PATIENTS: A total of 94 patients scheduled to undergo laparoscopic hepatectomy due to hepatocellular carcinoma. INTERVENTIONS: Ninety-four patients were randomized into a QLB group (receiving 20 mL of 0.375% ropivacaine on each side, 150 mg in total) or a control group (receiving 20 mL of 0.9% saline on each side). MEASUREMENTS: The primary outcome was the cumulative opioid consumption during the initial 24-h post-surgery. Secondary outcomes included pain scores and intraoperative and recovery parameters. MAIN RESULTS: The mean cumulative opioid consumption during the initial 24-h post-surgery was 30.8 ± 22.4 mg in the QLB group (n = 46) and 34.0 ± 19.4 mg in the control group (n = 46, mean differences: -3.3 mg, 95% confidence interval, -11.9 to 5.4, p = 0.457). The mean resting pain score at 1 h post-surgery was significantly lower in the QLB group than in the control group (5 [4-6.25] vs. 7 [4.75-8], p = 0.035).

276,Impact of telephone follow-up on hepatocellular carcinoma patients receiving oral chemotherapy from an ambulatory-care setting.,Sakata Y; Nomura H; Nakajima H; Kitajima T; Ito Y; Yamamoto Y,"INTRODUCTION: In recent years, most molecular target drugs have been administered orally, as prescribed at ambulatory services in hospitals and at patients' homes. Telephone follow-up is increasingly being used in clinical practice for patients needing additional support post-discharge and for the prevention of hospital readmissions. The purpose of this study was to clarify the clinical benefits of telephone follow-up while administering oral anticancer drugs. METHODS: This was a single-center, observational, retrospective study. We evaluated hepatocellular carcinoma patients who received sorafenib or lenvatinib between March 2010 and February 2018. The primary endpoint was the incidence of adverse events. RESULTS: From the total of 130 patients, 83 patients received telephone follow-up and 47 did not. The incidence of hand-foot skin reactions significantly reduced in patients with telephone follow-up (odds ratio (OR) 3.69, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.16-11.8, p = 0.020). The median durations (ranges) of adherence to oral chemotherapy were 259 days (15-1730) for the telephone follow-up group and 121 days (14-1105) for the no-telephone follow-up group (p < 0.001). Moreover, the disease control rate was significantly higher in the telephone follow-up group (OR 2.52, 95% CI 1.15-5.53, p = 0.020).

These thresholds are poorly studied in resin Y90, particularly in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). PURPOSE: To evaluate the efficacy of prospective voxel-based dosimetry for predicting treatment response and adverse events (AEs) in patients with HCC undergoing resin-based Y90 radioembolization. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This correlative study was based on a prospective single-arm clinical trial (NCT04172714), which evaluated the efficacy of low/scout (555 MBq) activity of resin-based Y90 for treatment planning. Partition model was used with goal of tumor dose (TD) > 200 Gy and non-tumoral liver dose (NTLD) < 70 Gy for non-segmental therapies. Single compartment dose of 200 Gy was used for segmentectomies. Prescribed Y90 activity minus scout activity was administered for therapeutic Y90 followed by Y90-PET/CT. Sureplan® (MIM Software, Cleveland, OH) was used for dosimetry analysis. Treatment response was evaluated at 3 and 6 months. Receiver operating characteristic curve determined TD response threshold for objective response (OR) and complete response (CR) as well as non-tumor liver dose (NTLD) threshold that predicted AEs. RESULTS: N = 30 patients were treated with 33 tumors (19 segmental and 14 non-segmental). One patient died before the first imaging, and clinical follow-up was excluded from this analysis. Overall, 26 (81%) of the tumors had an OR and 23 (72%) had a CR. A mean TD of 253 Gy predicted an OR with 92% sensitivity and 83% specificity (area under the curve (AUC = 0.929, p < 0.001). A mean TD of 337 Gy predicted a CR with 83% sensitivity and 89% specificity (AUC = 0.845, p < 0.001). A mean NTLD of 81 and 87 Gy predicted grade 3 AEs with 100% sensitivity and 100% specificity in the non-segmental cohort at 3- and 6-month post Y90, respectively.

278,"Real-World, Observational, Retrospective Study to Evaluate the Effectiveness and Safety of Treatment with Sorafenib in Patients with Advanced Hepatocellular Carcinoma.",Csipak AR; da Fonseca LG; López RVM; Estevez-Diz MDP,"BACKGROUND: Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) accounts for approximately 90% of liver cancer cases. Sorafenib, the first drug to demonstrate survival benefits for advanced HCC, was validated through the SHARP randomized clinical trial (RCT). While RCTs are essential for assessing new therapies, real-world studies provide additional insights into their effectiveness in routine clinical practice. This study aimed to evaluate sorafenib's real-world effectiveness by analyzing overall survival (OS) and the time to radiological and symptomatic progression. METHODS: Data from 368 patients treated with sorafenib at a Brazilian Cancer Center between 2009 and 2020 were retrospectively reviewed. RESULTS: The median OS was 9.6 months, and the time to radiological progression was 5.3 months, similar to the SHARP trial. However, the time to symptomatic progression was shorter (2.3 months) than the SHARP study (4.1 months). In terms of safety, 27.4% of patients presented clinically relevant toxicities, and 24.5% needed to discontinue treatment due to toxicity. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, sorafenib demonstrated effectiveness in the studied population, with OS and radiological progression times comparable to SHARP study results.

We hypothesized that BR solution would be more effective in improving acid-base equilibrium and more conducive to better liver function than Acetate Ringer's (AR) solution in conventional orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT) patients. METHODS: Sixty-nine adult patients underwent OLT. Patients in the bicarbonate and acetate groups received BR solution or AR solution as infused crystalloids and graft washing solution, respectively. The primary outcome was the effect on pH and base excess (BE) levels. The secondary outcome measures were the incidence and volume of intraoperative 5% sodium bicarbonate infusion and laboratory indicates of liver and kidney function. RESULTS: The pH and absolute BE values changed significantly during the anhepatic phase and immediately after transplanted liver reperfusion in the bicarbonate group compared with the acetate group (all P < 0.05). The incidence and volume of 5% sodium bicarbonate infusion were lower in the bicarbonate group than in the acetate group (all P < 0.05). The aspartate transaminase (AST) level at 7 postoperative days and the creatine level at 30 postoperative days were significantly higher in the acetate group than in the bicarbonate group (all P < 0.05).

280,Do low skeletal muscle bulk and disturbed body fat mass impact tumor recurrence in stage I/II hepatocellular carcinoma undergoing surgery? An observational cohort study.,Lee CW; Tsai HI; Hsu HM; Yu MC; Lee WC; Wang CC; Hsieh YC; Lin CY; Cheng ML; Lo CJ; Wang CT; Lin YC,"INTRODUCTION: The influence of deranged body composition on stage I/II hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) after surgery remains undetermined. The current study aimed to investigate the impact of low skeletal muscle bulk and disturbed body fat mass on the recurrence outcome of stage I/II HCC patients undergoing liver resection. The associated metabolomic alterations were also assessed. METHODS: From 2012 to 2021, stage I and II HCC patients who underwent liver resection at our institute were retrospectively reviewed. Their preoperative body composition including skeletal muscle mass and body fat volume was measured by computed tomography (CT). The recurrence outcome was recorded and analyzed. The preoperative serum was collected and subjected to metabolomic analysis. RESULTS: A total of 450 stage I and II HCC patients were included in the current study. Among them, 76% were male and around 60% had HBV infection. After stratified by normal cut-off values obtained from a healthy cohort, 6.4% of stage I/II HCC patients were found to have a low psoas muscle index (PMI), 17.8% a high subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT) index, and 27.8% a high visceral adipose tissue (VAT) index. Cox regression multivariate analysis further demonstrated that low PMI and high SAT index were independent prognostic factors for time-to-recurrence (TTR) after surgery. Metabolomic analysis discovered that free fatty acid β-oxidation was enhanced in patients with low PMI or high SAT index. CONCLUSION: The current study demonstrated that reduced psoas muscle mass may impair while elevated SAT may prolong the TTR of stage I/II HCC patients undergoing liver resections. VAT, on the other hand, was not associated with recurrence outcomes after surgery.

We evaluated the effectiveness of mailed outreach invitations plus patient navigation to promote HCC screening process completion in patients with cirrhosis. METHODS: Between April 2018 and September 2021, we conducted a multicentre pragmatic randomised clinical trial comparing mailed outreach plus patient navigation for HCC screening (n=1436) versus usual care with visit-based screening (n=1436) among patients with cirrhosis at three US health systems. Our primary outcome was screening process completion over a 36-month period, and our secondary outcome was the proportion of time covered (PTC) by screening. All patients were included in intention-to-screen analyses. RESULTS: All 2872 participants (median age 61.3 years; 32.3% women) were included in intention-to-screen analyses. Screening process completion was observed in 6.6% (95% CI: 5.3% to 7.9%) of patients randomised to outreach and 3.3% (95% CI: 2.4% to 4.3%) of those randomised to usual care (OR 2.05, 95% CI: 1.44 to 2.92). The intervention increased HCC screening process completion across most subgroups including age, sex, race and ethnicity, Child-Turcotte-Pugh class and health system. PTC was also significantly higher in the outreach arm than usual care (mean 37.5% vs 28.2%; RR 1.33, 95% CI: 1.31 to 1.35). Despite screening underuse, most HCC in both arms were detected at an early stage. CONCLUSION: Mailed outreach plus navigation significantly increased HCC screening process completion versus usual care in patients with cirrhosis, with a consistent effect across most examined subgroups. However, screening completion remained suboptimal in both arms, underscoring a need for more intensive interventions. TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: NCT02582918. permissions.

282,Prevalence of cancer in patients with hypothyroidism: Analysis using big data tools.,Díez JJ; Cabrera L; Iglesias P; Benavent M; Argüello G; López G; Parralejo A; Leal J,"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the frequency of different types of cancer in patients diagnosed with hypothyroidism using big data methodology on the Savana Manager platform. METHODS: An observational, retrospective study was carried out using electronic medical record (EMR) data from the Hospital Universitario Puerta de Hierro Majadahonda (Madrid). Information from the EMRs was extracted using artificial intelligence techniques and analysed using the Savana Manager v3.0 software. Searches were performed using the term ""hypothyroidism"" and the terms corresponding to the tumours analysed. RESULTS: Of a total population of 506,749 patients, 23,570 (4.7%) were diagnosed with hypothyroidism. Patients with this diagnosis had a significantly higher frequency of cancer than that found in non-hypothyroid subjects (OR 2.09, 95% confidence interval [CI] 2.01-2.17). This higher frequency was found both in women (OR 1.99, 95% CI 1.90-2.08) and in men (OR 2.83, 95% CI 2.63-3.05). However, this higher frequency of cancer was not observed in hypothyroid patients older than 60 years (OR 0.97, 95% CI 0.92-1.02). Although the frequency of most of the neoplasms studied individually was higher in the population with hypothyroidism, we observed that hypothyroid patients over 60 years of age had a significant decrease in the frequency of prostate, lung, colorectal, and liver cancer. CONCLUSION: Data from this hospital cohort suggest that there is a significant association between the diagnosis of hypothyroidism and cancer.

283,Association of adverse events and quality of life in patients with unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma.,Agirrezabal I; Pollock RF; Carion PL; Shergill S; Brennan VK; Pereira H; Chatellier G; Vilgrain V,"PURPOSE: Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the third-leading cause of cancer-related deaths globally. Patients are often diagnosed with advanced disease, in which systemic and locoregional therapies are commonly used as first-line treatment. Such treatments can cause adverse events (AEs) that negatively affect quality of life (QoL), which is particularly undesirable where prognosis is poor. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the impact of common AEs on QoL in patients with HCC. METHODS: Data from the SARAH randomized controlled trial (RCT) were analyzed. Given the large number of distinct AEs that occurred in the trial, AEs were grouped as in the SARAH trial and prioritized using principal component analysis (PCA). Linear mixed-effects models were then applied with age, ECOG status, and AEs as predictors of the QoL change as measured with the EORTC Core Quality of Life Questionnaire (QLQ-C30). RESULTS: The PCA resulted in the selection of 28 AEs for inclusion in the linear mixed-effects models. Of the 28 AEs, diarrhea, decreased appetite, abdominal pain, and palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia syndrome (hand-foot syndrome) were significant drivers of reductions in QoL as measured using the QLQ-C30 global health status scale. Diarrhea, abdominal pain, and hand-foot syndrome were also significant drivers of reduced QoL outcomes. CONCLUSION: The present analysis showed that diarrhea, decreased appetite, abdominal pain, and palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia were significantly associated with reduced QoL in patients with unresectable HCC. Reducing the incidence and/or severity of these AEs should therefore be a key focus when selecting the optimal treatments for these patients.",False,"Does not match target criteria: intervention is not specifically immunotherapy or targeted therapy, no comparison specified, outcome is not survival or response rate.",patients with HCC,systemic and locoregional therapies,not specified,impact of AEs on QoL,analysis of data from the SARAH randomized controlled trial,False,"Focuses on quality of life impact of AEs in unresectable HCC, not survival or response rates from immunotherapy or targeted therapy.",-,-,-,-,-,,No disagreement between Model A and B,False

METHODS: Total of 40 patients were enrolled in the study between September 2019 and November 2021. Data follow-up ends in April 2022. The study's main focus is on recurrence free survival (RFS), while the secondary objectives was safety. Chi-square tests, Kaplan-Meier, and Cox proportional hazards models were utilized to analyze the data. RESULTS: The median follow-up period was 21.40 months, and the median RFS was 15.40 months in the group that received combination therapy, which was statistically significantly different (HR: 0.44, p = 0.04) compared with the RFA group (8.2 months). RFS rates (RFSr) at 6, 12 and 18 months in the combination therapy groups and RFA groups were 80% vs 65%, 62.7% vs 35% and 48.7% vs 18.8%, respectively. Between the two groups, significant difference of RFSr was found at 18 months (p = 0.04). No statistical differences were observed between the two groups in terms of safeness (p > 0.05). The subgroup analysis indicated that the combination of RFA and anti-PD-1 led to better RFS than RFA alone. Moreover, patients benefited more from combination therapy in the groups younger than 60 years (HR: 0.26, p = 0.018), male (HR: 0.32, p = 0.028) and Child-Pugh grade A (HR: 0.38, p = 0.032).

285,Serum pentraxin-3 as a potential biomarker for diagnosis and prognosis in primary liver cancer: An observational study.,Chen L; Song S; Chen M; Liu Q; Zhou H,"This study aimed to examine serum pentraxin 3 levels in patients with primary liver cancer and to assess its potential as a diagnostic and prognostic biomarker. Serum samples were obtained from 180 patients with primary liver cancer and 180 healthy control subjects. The concentration of PTX3 in these samples was measured using an ELISA kit. The study also investigated the correlation between PTX3 levels and the clinicopathological characteristics of patients with primary liver cancer. The effectiveness of serum PTX3 in diagnosing primary liver cancer was evaluated using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves and their corresponding areas under the curve (AUC). The prognostic significance of serum PTX3 in patients with primary liver cancer was assessed using Kaplan-Meier survival curves. Serum PTX3 levels were elevated in patients with primary liver cancer compared to those in healthy control subjects. These levels were significantly correlated with drinking history, TNM stage, BCLC stage, tumor size, tumor number, and vascular invasion. However, no significant correlations were observed between PTX3 levels and other factors, such as age, sex, BMI, liver cirrhosis, histological grade, and histological type. With a cut-off value of 5.1 ng/mL, PTX3 effectively differentiated patients with primary liver cancer from healthy control subjects, achieving an AUC of 0.734, a sensitivity of 73.24%, and a specificity of 84.78%. Patients with higher serum PTX3 levels had lower overall survival rates and recurrence-free survival rates than those with lower PTX3 levels. Serum PTX3 levels are elevated in patients with primary liver cancer and high serum PTX3 levels are associated with poor prognosis. This suggests that serum PTX3 has the potential to be a novel biomarker for both the diagnosis and prognosis of primary liver cancer.

Several different targeted therapeutics have been applied in combination with immunotherapeutic regimens to date in patients with advanced HCC. The present study was developed to evaluate the relative safety and efficacy of hepatectomy of HCC in combination with targeted apatinib treatment and immunotherapeutic camrelizumab treatment CNLC-IIIb stage HCC patients with the goal of providing evidence regarding the potential value of this therapeutic regimen in individuals diagnosed with advanced HCC. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: This is a multicentre phase II trial with single-arm in which patients undergo hepatectomy in combination with targeted treatment (apatinib) and immunotherapy (camrelizumab). Patients will undergo follow-up every 2-3 months following treatment initiation to record any evidence of disease progression and adverse event incidence for a minimum of 24 months following the discontinuation of treatment until reaching study endpoint events or trial termination. The primary endpoint for this study is patient mortality.

287,Prediction of Liver-Related Events With a Combination of Liver Stiffness Measurements and Controlled Attenuation Parameters in Japanese Patients With Biopsy-Proven Non-alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease.,Hayashi H; Kamada Y; Fujii H; Takahashi H; Oeda S; Iwaki M; Kawaguchi T; Tomita E; Yoneda M; Tokushige A; Ueda S; Aishima S; Sumida Y; Nakajima A; Okanoue T,"OBJECTIVE: Liver stiffness measurements (LSMs) and controlled attenuation parameters (CAPs) obtained using vibration-controlled transient elastography (VCTE) are recognized non-invasive methods of assessing liver histology. The usefulness of CAP for predicting liver-related events (LREs: hepatocellular carcinoma, decompensation, bleeding varices) is not well understood worldwide. Our aim was to re-evaluate the cutoff values of LSM/CAP in Japan and to examine whether LSM/CAP can predict LRE. METHODS: Japanese NAFLD patients (n = 403) who underwent both liver biopsy and VCTE were enrolled. We determined optimal cutoff values of LSM/CAP diagnoses for fibrosis stage and steatosis grade and investigated their clinical outcome based on LSM/CAP values. RESULTS: The LSM cutoff values for F1 to F4 are 7.1, 7.9, 10.0 and 20.2 kPa, and the CAP cutoff values for S1 to S3 are 230, 282 and 320 dB/m. During a median follow-up of 2.7 y (range: 0.0-12.5 y), 11 patients developed LREs. The incidence of LREs in the LSM Hi (≥8.7) group was significantly higher than that in the LSM Lo (<8.7) group (p = 0.003), and the incidence in the CAP Lo (<295) group was higher than that in CAP Hi (≥295) group (p = 0.018). Considering LSM and CAP together, the risk of LRE was higher in the LSM Hi CAP Lo group than in the LSM Hi CAP Hi group (p = 0.03).

The nomogram was internally validated using Bootstrapping and externally validated with a dataset of 203 patients who underwent liver cancer resection at the Department of General Surgery III of the same hospital from January 1, 2020, to December 31, 2022. We evaluated the nomogram using the receiver operating characteristic curve, calibration curve, and decision curve analysis. Variables such as drinking history, postoperative serum albumin, postoperative total bilirubin, right hepatectomy, diaphragm incision, and intraoperative blood loss were observed to be associated with SPOPE. These factors were integrated into our nomogram. The C-index of the nomogram was 0.736 (95% CI: 0.692-0.781) in the training set and 0.916 (95% CI: 0.872-0.961) in the validation set.

289,Validation of the 2019 EULAR/ACR classification criteria for systemic lupus erythematosus in an academic tertiary care centre.,Schmidtmann I; Kraus D; Weinmann A; Pütz K; Claßen P; Schleicher EM; Boedecker-Lips SC; Weinmann-Menke J,"OBJECTIVES: To assess the sensitivity and specificity of the 2019 EULAR/American College of Rheumatology (ACR) classification criteria for systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) in outpatients at an academic tertiary care centre and to compare them to the 1997 ACR and the 2012 Systemic Lupus International Collaborating Clinics criteria. METHODS: Prospective and retrospective observational cohort study. RESULTS: 3377 patients were included: 606 with SLE, 1015 with non-SLE autoimmune-mediated rheumatic diseases (ARD) and 1756 with non-ARD diseases (hepatocellular carcinoma, primary biliary cirrhosis, autoimmune hepatitis). The 2019 criteria were more sensitive than the 1997 criteria (87.0% vs 81.8%), but less specific (98.1% vs 99.5% in the entire cohort and 96.5% vs 98.8% in patients with non-SLE ARD), resulting in Youden Indexes for patients with SLE/non-SLE ARD of 0.835 and 0.806, respectively. The most sensitive items were history of antinuclear antibody (ANA) positivity and detection of anti-double-stranded deoxyribonucleic acid (dsDNA) antibodies. These were also the least specific items. The most specific items were class III/IV lupus nephritis and the combination of low C3 and low C4 complement levels, followed by class II/V lupus nephritis, either low C3 or low C4 complement levels, delirium and psychosis, when these were not attributable to non-SLE causes. CONCLUSIONS: In this cohort from an independent academic medical centre, the sensitivity and specificity of the 2019 lupus classification criteria were confirmed.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: This single-center, prospective, phase II, randomized controlled, non-inferiority, double-blind trial will enroll 128 treatment-naïve patients with HCC (≤ 5 tumors, 1-5 cm in diameter) for conventional TACE. Participants will be randomly assigned (1:1) to either IDA-TACE or DOX-TACE, with stratification by Child-Pugh class. Superselective conventional TACE will be performed using cone-beam CT and small-bore microcatheters. Patient evaluations, including dynamic imaging and blood tests, will occur at 1, 3, and 6 months post-initial treatment. The primary outcome measure is the objective response rate (ORR) according to mRECIST at 6 months. Secondary outcomes include 3-month and 6-month tumor responses, time-to-progression, the incidence of treatment-related serious adverse events within 30 days, and the incidence and severity of any adverse events. STATISTICS: Non-inferiority will be claimed if the upper limit of a one-sided 97.5% confidence interval for the proportion difference (i.e., ""6-month ORR of DOX-TACE"" - ""6-month ORR of IDA-TACE"") falls below 0.15 in both intention-to-treat and per-protocol analyses. The proportion difference and its confidence interval will be calculated by the Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel method to obtain a weighted average of stratum-specific proportion differences. EXPECTED GAIN OF KNOWLEDGE: If IDA-TACE demonstrates outcomes comparable to DOX-TACE, this study could provide compelling evidence that various cytotoxic agents yield similar contributions in TACE, considering the minor role of chemotherapeutic agents in TACE.

This study investigated whether serum autotaxin (ATX) could predict LRE in patients with PBC. METHODS: This retrospective multicenter investigation included 190 biopsy-proven untreated patients with PBC. All subjects were followed for at least 1 year, during which time the prevalence of LRE, including newly developing hepatocellular carcinoma, esophagogastric varices, ascites, and hepatic encephalopathy, was investigated in relation with ATX levels at the time of liver biopsy. RESULTS: During the median follow-up period of 9.7 years, LRE were observed in 22 patients (11.6%). The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve and cutoff value of serum ATX for predicting LRE were 0.80 and 1.086 mg/L, respectively. Patients with serum ATX ≥1.086 had a significantly higher cumulative incidence of LRE compared with patients with ATX < 1.086 (33.3% vs 3.6%, P < 0.00001). Notably, the predictive capability of ATX for LRE in patients with PBC surpassed that of FIB-4, ALBI, APRI, and Mac-2-binding protein glycan isomer. A multivariate Cox proportional hazards model revealed ATX as an independent associated factor for LRE (hazard ratio 6.24, 95% confidence interval 1.87-20.80, P = 0.003) along with Nakanuma stage (hazard ratio 2.75, 95% confidence interval 1.52-4.99, P < 0.001).

METHODS: The phase 1 study involved phase 1a monotherapy dose-escalation (part 1) and phase 1b combination therapy dose escalation (part 2) and expansion (part 3). Various dosing schedules of CS1002 (0.3, 1, or 3 mg/kg every 3 weeks, or 3 mg/kg every 9 weeks) were evaluated with 200 mg CS1003 every 3 weeks in part 3. RESULTS: Parts 1, 2, and 3 included a total of 13, 18, and 61 patients, respectively. No dose-limiting toxicities or maximum tolerated doses were observed. Treatment-related adverse events (TRAEs) were reported in 30.8%, 83.3%, and 75.0% of patients in parts 1, 2, and 3, respectively. Grade ≥3 TRAEs were experienced by 15.4%, 50.0%, and 18.3% of patients in each part. Of 61 patients evaluable for efficacy, 23 (37.7%) achieved objective responses in multiple tumor types. Higher objective response rates were observed with conventional and high-dose CS1002 regimens (1 mg/kg every 3 weeks or 3 mg/kg every 9 weeks) compared to low-dose CS1002 (0.3 mg/kg every 3 weeks) in microsatellite instability-high/mismatch repair-deficient tumors, melanoma, and hepatocellular carcinoma (50.0% vs. 58.8%, 14.3% vs. 42.9%, and 0% vs. 16.7%). CONCLUSION: CS1002, as monotherapy, and in combination with CS1003, had a manageable safety profile across a broad dosing range. Promising antitumor activities were observed in patients with immune oncology (IO)-naive and IO-refractory tumors across CS1002 dose levels when combined with CS1003, supporting further evaluation of this treatment combination for solid tumors. PLAIN LANGUAGE SUMMARY: CS1002 is a human immunoglobulin (Ig) G1 monoclonal antibody that blocks the interaction of CTLA-4 with its ligands and increases T-cell activation/proliferation. CS1003, now named nofazinlimab, is a humanized, recombinant IgG4 monoclonal antibody that blocks the interaction between human PD-1 and its ligands. In this original article, we determined the safety profile of CS1002 as monotherapy and in combination with CS1003. Furthermore, we explored the antitumor activity of the combination in anti-programmed cell death protein (ligand)-1 (PD-[L]1)-naive microsatellite instability-high/mismatch repair-deficient (MSI-H/dMMR) pan tumors, and anti-PD-(L)1-refractory melanoma and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). CS1002 in combination with CS1003 had manageable safety profile across a broad dosing range and showed promising antitumor activities across CS1002 dose levels when combined with CS1003.

293,Correlation of pathological examination with indocyanine green (ICG) intensity gradients: a prospective study in patients with liver tumor.,She WH; Chan MY; Tsang SHY; Dai WC; Chan ACY; Lo CM; Cheung TT,"BACKGROUND: Intraoperative indocyanine green (ICG) fluorescence imaging has been shown to be a new and innovative way to illustrate the optimal resection margin in hepatectomy for hepatocellular carcinoma. This study investigated its accuracy in resection margin determination by looking into the correlation of ICG intensity gradients with pathological examination results of resected specimens. METHODS: This was a prospective, single-center, non-randomized controlled study. Patients who had liver tumors indicating liver resection were recruited. The hypothesis was that the use of intraoperative near-infrared/ICG fluorescence imaging would be a promising guiding tool for removing hepatocellular carcinoma with a better resection margin. Patients were given ICG (0.25 mg/kg) 1 day before operation. Resected specimens were inspected under a fluorescent imaging system. Biopsies were taken from tumors and normal tissue. Color signals obtained from ICG fluorescence imaging were compared with biopsies for analysis. RESULTS: Twenty-two patients were recruited for study. The median size of their tumors was 2.25 cm. One patient had resection margin involvement. Under ICG fluorescence, the tumors typically lighted up as yellow color, wrapped by a zone of green color. Tumors of 17 patients (77.3%) displayed yellow color and were confirmed malignancy, while tumors of 12 patients (54.5%) displayed green color and were confirmed malignancy. Receiver operating characteristic curve was used to measure the sensitivity and specificity of the green color to look for a clear resection margin. The area under the curve was 85.3% (p = 0.019, 95% confidence interval 0.696-1.000), with a sensitivity of 0.706 and specificity of 1.000.

A novel drug that raises the PLT count by acting on the thrombopoietin receptor has recently become available. METHODS: Lusutrombopag 3 mg was administered daily for 7 days to patients who underwent RFA for liver tumors with low PLT counts (< 50,000 PLT µL(- 1)). We collected demographic data concerning the patients' liver function and PLT counts. RESULTS: Lusutrombopag was administered to 91 patients, with a median age of 71 years (range 51-86). Forty-two patients had hepatitis C, 12 had hepatitis B, 21 had alcoholic liver disease, 11 had nonalcoholic steatohepatitis, and five had other diseases. The median Child-Pugh score was 7 (range 5-11). Thirty-seven patients had stage I tumors, 41 had Stage II, 12 had stage III, and one had stage IV. PLT count was elevated from 4.4 × 10(4) ± 1.4 × 10(4) to 8.6 × 10(4) ± 2.5 × 10(4) PLT µL(- 1). Lusutrombopag administration prevented PLT transfusions in 84/91 patients (92%). No patient had bleeding complications after RFA. One had portal thrombosis after lusutrombopag administration. Patients who achieved PLT counts of > 50,000 PLT µL(- 1) had higher PLT counts before lusutrombopag administration. The degree of splenomegaly did not affect the rate of PLT count elevation. There was no specific adverse effect by administrating lusutrombopag for patients with PLT counts of around 50,000 µL(- 1) but > 50,000 µL(- 1). CONCLUSIONS: Lusutrombopag administration before RFA was effective and seemed to be relatively safe for hepatocellular carcinoma patients with low PLT counts.

We previously developed an artificial intelligence (AI) system based on convolutional neural network for detection of focal liver lesions (FLLs) in ultrasound. The primary aim of this study was to evaluate whether the AI system can assist non-expert operators to detect FLLs in real-time, during ultrasound examinations. METHOD: This single-center prospective randomized controlled study evaluated the AI system in assisting non-expert and expert operators. Patients with and without FLLs were enrolled and had ultrasound performed twice, with and without AI assistance. McNemar's test was used to compare paired FLL detection rates and false positives between groups with and without AI assistance. RESULTS: 260 patients with 271 FLLs and 244 patients with 240 FLLs were enrolled into the groups of non-expert and expert operators, respectively. In non-experts, FLL detection rate in the AI assistance group was significantly higher than the no AI assistance group (36.9 % vs 21.4 %, p < 0.001). In experts, FLL detection rates were not significantly different between the groups with and without AI assistance (66.7 % vs 63.3 %, p = 0.32). False positive detection rates in the groups with and without AI assistance were not significantly different in both non-experts (14.2 % vs 9.2 %, p = 0.08) and experts (8.6 % vs 9.0 %, p = 0.85). CONCLUSIONS: The AI system resulted in significant increase in detection of FLLs during ultrasound examinations by non-experts.

297,Rotational ThromboElastometry-guided blood component administration versus standard of care in patients with Cirrhosis and coagulopathy undergoing Invasive ProcEdures (RECIPE): study protocol for a randomised controlled trial.,Janko N; Majeed A; Kemp W; Hogan C; Nandurkar H; Roberts SK,"BACKGROUND: Patients with cirrhosis often undergo invasive procedures both for management of complications of their advanced liver disease, including treatment for hepatocellular carcinoma, as well as underlying comorbidities. Despite a current understanding that most patients with cirrhosis are in a rebalanced haemostatic state (despite abnormalities in conventional coagulation tests, namely INR and platelet count), patients with cirrhosis are still often given prophylactic blood components based on these conventional parameters, in an effort to reduce procedure-related bleeding. Viscoelastic tests such as Rotational Thromboelastometry (ROTEM) provide a global measurement of haemostasis and have been shown to predict bleeding risk more accurately than conventional coagulation tests, and better guide blood product transfusion in a number of surgical and trauma-related settings. The aim of this study is to assess the utility of a ROTEM-based algorithm to guide prophylactic blood component delivery in patients with cirrhosis undergoing invasive procedures. We hypothesise that ROTEM-based decision-making will lead to a reduction in pre-procedural blood component usage, particularly fresh frozen plasma (FFP), compared with standard of care, whilst maintaining optimal clinical outcomes. METHODS: This is a multi-centre randomised controlled trial comparing ROTEM-guided prophylactic blood component administration to standard of care in patients with cirrhosis and coagulopathy undergoing invasive procedures. The primary efficacy outcome of the trial is the proportion of procedures requiring prophylactic transfusion, with the primary safety outcome being procedure-related bleeding complications. Secondary outcomes include the amount of blood products (FFP, platelets, cryoprecipitate) transfused, transfusion-related side effects, procedure-related complications other than bleeding, hospital length of stay and survival. DISCUSSION: We anticipate that this project will lead to improved prognostication of patients with cirrhosis, in terms of their peri-procedural bleeding risk. We hope to show that a significant proportion of cirrhotic patients, deemed coagulopathic on the basis of standard coagulation tests such as INR and platelet count, are actually in a haemostatic balance and thus do not require prophylactic blood product, leading to decreased and more efficient blood component use.

METHODS: Clinical cases of HCC patients diagnosed at Hunan Integrated Traditional Chinese and Western Medicine Hospital were included, and these were randomly divided into the training cohort (n = 219) and the validation cohort (n = 94), and those patients were divided into low GRIm-Score group (scores 0, 1, and 2) and high GRIm-Score group (scores 3, 4, and 5). In the training cohort, independent risk factors were determined by Cox regression analysis, and a nomogram was constructed by independent risk factors. The efficiency and the clinical applicability of nomograms were evaluated using ROC curves, calibration plot, and the decision curve (DCA), and the patients were divided into high-risk, middle-risk, and low-risk groups according to total score of nomogram. RESULTS: Compared to low HCC-GRIm score group, high HCC-GRIm score group with BCLC stage is more advanced (P < 0.001), and fewer patients received TACE (P = 0.005) and surgical treatment (P = 0.001). There was higher rate of the presence of vascular invasion (P < 0.001) and distant metastasis (P < 0.001). Multivariate Cox regression analysis screened 4 independent risk factors to construct a nomogram of HCC patients, including HCC-GRIm score, BCLC stage, albumin-to-globulin ratio (AGR), and glutamyl trans-peptidase (GGT). The consistency index (C-index) of the nomogram of the training was 0.843 (0.832-0.854) and the validation was 0.870 (0.856-0.885). The time-dependent parameter showed the AUC values of the training cohort at 1, 3, and 5 years were 0.954 (95% CI 0.929-0.980), 0.952 (95% CI 0.919-0.985), and 925 (95% CI 0.871-0.979), while the AUC values of validation cohort at 1, 3, and 5 years were 0.974 (95% CI 0.950-0.998), 0.965 (95% CI 0.931-0.999), and 0.959 (95% CI 0.898-1.021). The calibration plot showed the nomogram fits well onto perfect curves, and the DCA curve showed the net benefit of the nomogram at a certain probability threshold is significantly higher than the net benefit of the BCLC stage at the same threshold probability. Finally, all patients were divided into high-risk, middle-risk, and low-risk groups based on the total score of nomogram, and it showed effectively to identify high-risk patients.

299,Role of stereotactic body radiotherapy for inferior vena cava tumour thrombus in hepatocellular carcinoma.,Sharma D; Thaper D; Kamal R; Yadav HP,"INTRODUCTION: To evaluate the role of stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients with inferior vena cava tumour thrombus (IVCTT) who are not suitable for other loco-regional therapies. METHODS: This is an observational retrospective study done between May 2020 and April 2022. The data of 17 patients who underwent SBRT were collected. Patients of Child-Pugh score (CPS) A5-B7 and along with a liver reserve of ≥700 cc were included. Local control (LC), overall survival (OS) and adverse events including hepatic decompensation were carefully recorded. RESULTS: In the cohort, the tumour thrombus was extended to the right atrium in nine (52.9%) patients, and regional nodal and lung were found in 60% and 31.4% of patients respectively. The median gross tumour volume (GTV) was 745 cc (107-1,650 cc). The median SBRT dose prescription was 35 Gy (25-45 Gy) in 5-10 fractions. At 6 months, LC and OS were 80% and 75% respectively. On multivariate analysis, an ALBI score >-2.36 was found to be the predictor for the poor OS. Post-SBRT, a change in CPs by 2 points was observed in one patient (5.9%) which was managed conservatively. Post-radiation, improvement in pain and discomfort was observed in 92.3% and 87% of patients, respectively and bone metastasis related pain was also resolved. CONCLUSION: Stereotactic body radiotherapy is a safe and feasible option for HCC patients with IVC and right atrium tumour thrombosis.

We aimed to explore the prognostic value of peripheral immune factors (PIFs) for better ER prediction of HCC after thermal ablation. METHODS: Patients who received peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) tests before thermal ablation were included. Clinical parameters and 18 PIFs were selected to construct Model(Clin), Model(PIFs) and the hybrid Model(PIFs-Clin). Model performances were evaluated using area under the curve (AUC), and recurrence-free survival (RFS) were analyzed by Kaplan-Meier analysis and log-rank tests. RESULTS: 244 patients were included and were randomly divided in 3:1 ratio to discovery and validation cohorts. Clinical parameters including tumor size and AFP, and PIFs including neutrophils, platelets, CD3(+)CD16(+)CD56(+) NKT and CD8(+)CD28(-) T lymphocytes were selected. The Model(PIFs-Clin) showed increase in predictive performance compared with Model(Clin), with the AUC improved from 0.664 (95%CI:0.588-0.740) to 0.801 (95%CI:0.734-0.867) in discovery cohort (p < 0.0001), and from 0.645 (95%CI:0.510-0.781) to 0.737(95%CI:0.608-0.865) in validation cohort (p = 0.1006). Model(PIFs-Clin) enabled ER risk stratification of patients. Patients predicted in Model(PIFs-Clin) high-risk subgroup had a poor RFS compared with those predicted as Model(PIFs-Clin) low-risk subgroup, with the median RFS was 18.00 month versus 100.78 month in discovery cohort (p < 0.0001); and 24.00 month versus 60.35 month in validation cohort (p = 0.288).

Tumor growth rate (KG) was estimated for patients in IMbrave151. A pre-existing TGI-OS model for patients with hepatocellular carcinoma in IMbrave150 was modified to include available IMbrave151 study covariates and KG estimates and used to simulate IMbrave151 study outcomes. At the interim progression-free survival (PFS) analysis (98 patients, 27 weeks follow-up), clear separation in tumor dynamic profiles with a faster shrinkage rate and slower KG (0.0103 vs. 0.0117 week(-1) ; tumor doubling time 67 vs. 59 weeks; KG geometric mean ratio of 0.84) favoring the bevacizumab containing arm was observed. At the first interim analysis for PFS, the simulated OS hazard ratio (HR) 95% prediction interval (PI) of 0.74 (95% PI: 0.58-0.94) offered an early prediction of treatment benefit later confirmed at the final analysis, observed HR of 0.76 based on 159 treated patients and 34 weeks of follow-up. This is the first prospective application of a TGI-OS modeling framework supporting gating of a phase III trial.

The combination of lenvatinib (LEN) and transcatheter arterial chemoembolisation (TACE), termed LEN-TACE sequential therapy, has shown a high response rate and survival benefit in patients with intermediate-stage HCC. This trial aims to evaluate the efficacy and safety of LEN-TACE sequential therapy and the feasibility of surgical resection for intermediate-stage HCC beyond the Up-to-7 criteria. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: This is a multicentre, single-arm, prospective clinical trial. Thirty patients with intermediate-stage HCC beyond the Up-to-7 criteria will be enrolled. Patients eligible for this study will undergo LEN-TACE sequential therapy in which LEN is administered for 4 weeks, followed by TACE, and then further LEN for another 4 weeks. Patients will be assessed for efficacy of LEN-TACE sequential therapy and resectability, and surgical resection will be performed if the HCC is considered radically resectable. The primary outcome of this study is the resection rate after LEN-TACE sequential therapy. The secondary outcomes are the objective response rate of LEN-TACE sequential therapy, safety, curative resection rate, overall survival and recurrence-free survival. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: This trial was approved by the Institutional Review Board of Hiroshima University, Japan (approval no. CRB210003), and has been registered with the Japan Registry of Clinical Trials (jRCTs061220007).

Here, we evaluated the safety and efficacy of the combination of pexastimogene devacirepvec (PexaVec) plus durvalumab (anti-programmed death ligand 1) with and without tremelimumab (anti-cytotoxic T-lymphocyte associated protein 4) in patients with standard chemotherapy refractory mismatch repair proficient (pMMR) metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) in a phase I/II trial. METHODS: Adult patients with histologically confirmed advanced pMMR mCRC, who had progressed on at least two prior lines of systemic chemotherapy were studied in four cohorts. Patients received four doses of PexaVec IV at a dose of 3×10(8) plaque forming units (pfu) (dose level 1) or 1×10(9) pfu (dose level 2) every 2 weeks. Twelve days after the first PexaVec administration, patients received either 1500 mg of durvalumab every 28 days alone or an additional single dose of 300 mg tremelimumab on day 1. Responses were assessed every 8 weeks by CT or MRI. AEs were recorded. The primary endpoints were safety and feasibility. Secondary endpoints included progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival. Paired tumor samples and peripheral blood were collected to perform immune monitoring. RESULTS: Thirty-four patients with mCRC enrolled on to the study: 16 patients in the PexaVec/durvalumab cohorts and 18 patients in the PexaVec/durvalumab/tremelimumab cohorts. Overall, the combination of PexaVec plus immune checkpoint inhibitors did not result in any unexpected toxicities. Most common toxicities observed were fever and chills after PexaVec infusion. Two cases of grade 3 colitis, one case of a grade 2 myositis and one case of grade 3 hypotension resulted in discontinuation of immune checkpoint inhibitor and PexaVec treatment, respectively. The median PFS in the PexaVec/durvalumab/tremelimumab cohorts was 2.3 months (95% CI: 2.2 to 3.2 months) vs 2.1 months (95% CI: 1.7 to 2.8 months; p=0.57) in the PexaVec/durvalumab cohorts. Flow cytometry analysis of peripheral blood mononuclear cells revealed an increase in Ki67(+)CD8(+) T cells on treatment. CONCLUSION: PexaVec in combination with durvalumab and tremelimumab is safe and tolerable. No unexpected toxicities were observed. The combination of PexaVec/durvalumab/tremelimumab demonstrated potential clinical activity in patients with pMMR mCRC, but further studies are needed to identify the predictive biomarkers.

304,Racial Disparities in Treatment Initiation and Outcomes of Chronic Hepatitis B Virus Infection in North America.,Khalili M; Leonard KR; Ghany MG; Hassan M; Roberts LR; Sterling RK; Belle SH; Lok AS,"IMPORTANCE: Disparities in treatment initiation may affect outcomes, but data on racially diverse populations with chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection are limited. OBJECTIVE: To examine whether HBV treatment initiation and outcomes differ among racial groups. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: From January 14, 2011, to January 28, 2018, hepatitis B surface antigen-positive adults (age ≥18 years) not receiving anti-HBV therapy were enrolled and followed up at weeks 12, 24, and every 24 weeks thereafter in a multicenter longitudinal cohort study (Hepatitis B Research Network [HBRN] adult cohort study) conducted in North America. The last study visit and data collection were completed January 28, 2019. Data were analyzed from August 27, 2021, to August 25, 2022. All HBRN participants were included unless they had acute HBV, HIV, hepatitis C or D, less than 24-weeks of follow-up after enrollment, initiated treatment at or immediately after enrollment, or had unknown race. EXPOSURES: Participants had clinical and laboratory assessments and could receive anti-HBV treatment after enrollment. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Hepatitis B virus treatment initiation and major adverse liver outcomes (hepatic decompensation, hepatocellular carcinoma, liver transplant, and death). RESULTS: Of 1550 participants, 193 (12%) were African American or Black, 1157 (75%) were Asian, 157 (10%) were White, and 43 (3%) were other races; 789 (51%) were women, and the median age was 41.2 (IQR, 32.9-51.6) years. Sociodemographic and virologic parameters differed between groups. During 5727 person-years of follow-up, 504 participants initiated treatment, with incidences of 4.8 per 100 person-years in African American or Black individuals, 9.9 per 100 person-years in Asian individuals, 6.6 per 100 person-years in White individuals, and 7.9 per 100 person-years in those of other races (P < .001). A lower proportion (14%) of African American or Black participants met treatment criteria compared with Asian (22%) and White (27%) individuals (P = .01). The cumulative probabilities of treatment initiation after meeting the criteria were not significantly different among racial groups (African American or Black, 0.45; Asian, 0.38; White, 0.40 at 48 weeks and African American or Black, 0.45; Asian, 0.51; White, 0.51 at 72 weeks; P = .68). The incidence of major adverse liver outcomes was 0.1 per 100 person-years and did not differ by race. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this observational study of chronic HBV, African American or Black participants were less likely than individuals of other races to meet treatment criteria, but among those who did, HBV treatment receipt did not differ significantly by race or socioeconomic factors. Not all eligible participants initiated treatment, but adverse liver outcomes were rare.

We present here the results of a single-arm, open-label, exploratory study of lenvatinib plus the EGFR-TKI gefitinib for patients with HCC resistance to lenvatinib (NCT04642547; n = 30). Only patients with EGFR(high) HCC and progressive disease after lenvatinib treatment were recruited in the study.

In Korea, sofosbuvir (SOF) and ledipasvir (LDV)/SOF were launched in 2016. Patients who achieve a sustained virologic response (SVR) following DAA treatment are predicted to have a favorable prognosis. Nevertheless, little is known regarding the prognosis of Korean CHC patients who receive SOF-based treatment and achieve SVR. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to look into the long-term outcomes for these patients. Materials and Methods: This was a prospective, multicenter observational study. CHC patients were enrolled who, following SOF or LDV/SOF treatment, had achieved SVR. The last day for follow-up was December 2023. The primary endpoint was HCC occurrence, which was checked at least once per year. Results: A total of 516 patients were included in this analysis, with a median follow-up duration of 39.0 months. Among them, 231 were male patients (44.8%), with a median age of 62.0 years. Genotypes were 1 (90, 17.4%), 2 (423, 82.0%), and 3 (3, 0.6%). The combination of SOF plus ribavirin was the most common treatment (394, 76.4%). In total, 160 patients were cirrhotic (31.0%), and the mean Child-Pugh score was 5.1. Within a maximum of 7 years, 21 patients (4.1%) developed HCC. Patients with HCC were older (69 vs. 61 years, p = 0.013) and had a higher cirrhosis incidence (81.0 vs. 28.9%, p < 0.001), higher AFP (6.0 vs. 3.3, p = 0.003) and higher APRI (0.8 vs. 0.5, p = 0.005). Age over 65 (p = 0.016) and cirrhosis (p = 0.005) were found to be significant risk factors for HCC by Cox regression analysis. Conclusions: Patients who achieved SVR with SOF-based treatment had a relatively favorable prognosis. However, the risk of HCC was not eliminated, especially in older and cirrhotic patients.

This leads to a poor survival rate, which means a technique capable of reliably detecting pre-cancer in the bile duct is urgently required. Unfortunately, radiological imaging lacks adequate accuracy for distinguishing dysplastic and benign biliary ducts, while endoscopic techniques, which can directly assess the bile duct lining, often suffer from insufficient sampling. Here, we report an endoscopic optical light scattering technique for clinical evaluation of the malignant potential of the bile duct. This technique employs an ultraminiature spatial gating fiber optic probe compatible with cholangioscopes and endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) catheters. The probe allowed us to investigate the internal cellular composition of the bile duct epithelium with light scattering spectroscopy (LSS) and phenotypic properties of the underlying connective tissue with diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (DRS).

Peripheral blood samples were collected before and within 28 days after the first treatment to analyze lymphocyte subsets and other immune cells. RESULTS: Higher counts of total white blood cells (WBCs), lymphocytes, monocytes, and basophils were significantly associated with disease control rate. Subgroup analysis revealed that abnormal BMI, diabetes, infection, and multiple lesions were significantly associated with T cell abnormalities. Age, abnormal BMI, hypertension, and abnormal AFP were linked to total T cell abnormalities.

However, there is a lack of data on the long-term prognosis of DAA therapy for CHC patients after achieving SVR in the real world. The aim of this study was to evaluate the long-term clinical prognosis of patients with chronic hepatitis C treated by DAA after achieving SVR. This study was a single-center, retrospective, observational study that included 243 CHC patients who reached SVR after DAA treatment in the Third Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University from January 2017 to December 2021, with a median follow-up period (FUP) of 24 months, to assess the long-term prognosis and clinical outcomes of CHC patients who reached SVR by DAA treatment.

METHODS: Simulations of a real-world explanatory trial of transarterial radioembolization for advanced unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma with portal vein invasion were performed to examine the effects of cohort specification on survival outcomes and patient sample size. Simulations comprised 24 different permutations of the trial varied on three disease nonspecific eligibility parameters. Treatment and control arms for these emulated trials were drawn from the National Cancer Database and matched by treatment propensity. Target trial emulation served as the causal framework for this analysis, allowing the architecture of a true controlled experiment to address forms of bias routinely encountered in comparative effectiveness studies involving real-world observational data. RESULTS: Twenty-four propensity score-matched cohorts comprising a wider clinical spectrum of patients than specified by the original target trial were successfully generated using the National Cancer Database. The arms for each of the emulated trials demonstrated exchangeability across all eligibility criteria and other clinical covariates. Significant treatment benefits were associated with only a narrow range of eligibility criteria, indicating that the original target trial was well specified.

We aimed to investigate the potential similarities and differences regarding the disease among Arabs and Jews. Retrospective study included all patients older than 18 years with NAFLD diagnosis according to ICD-10 codes. Data regarding demographics, comorbidities, and outcomes were retrieved using the MdClone platform from ""Clalit"" in Israel. Data concerning 34,090 Arab patients and 173,500 Jewish patients with NAFLD were included. Arab patients were significantly younger at diagnosis (35.0 ± 13 years vs. 43.6 ± 15 years, p < 0.001) and had higher rates of obesity and diabetes mellitus (69.5% vs. 56.5% and 27.0% vs. 22.7%, p < 0.001, respectively). Arab patients had higher rates of cirrhosis and portal hypertension-related complications (2.5% vs. 2.0%, p < 0.001), esophageal varices (0.9% vs. 0.5%, p < 0.001), spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (0.3% vs. 0.1%, p < 0.001), and hepatorenal syndrome (0.3% vs. 0.1%, p < 0.001). There was no significant difference in the prevalence of hepatocellular carcinoma between study groups (0.4% vs. 0.5%, p = 0.156).

MATERIAL AND METHODS: In this prospective study (NCT04866290), 100 adults with confirmed mCRC to the liver who were ineligible for resection were enrolled and followed up to 24 months or death. Study outcomes among Salvage (patients not tolerating more cycles of chemotherapy) and Non-salvage patients included overall survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS), objective response (OR), objective response rate (ORR), best tumor response (BTR), adverse events (AEs), and pharmacokinetics of irinotecan and its active metabolite, 7-ethyl-10-hydroxy-camptothecin (SN38). RESULTS: The median age was 66 years (range: 31-89). Median OS was 15.08 months (95% confidence interval [CI]: 12.33-17.25). PFS was 8.52 months (95% CI: 6.0-9.0; p < 0.001). ORR was 42.2% (95% CI: 31.57-53.50) and 35.9% (95% CI: 25.57-47.62) based on modified RECIST (Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors) and RECIST 1.1 criteria. BTR was not significantly different between mRECIST and RECIST (p = 0.745). The Non-salvage group had a statistically significant difference in median OS relative to the Salvage group (15.3 vs. 3 months; p < 0.001). Pharmacokinetic analyses demonstrated no correlation of OS with plasma concentration of irinotecan and SN38 (all p > 0.05).

313,Subcentimeter hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) on gadoxetic-acid-enhanced MRI: less frequent typical imaging features compared to 1-2 cm HCC but better prognosis after surgical resection.,Huang P; Shi Q; Ni X; Liu L; Zhou C; Wu F; Wang C; Xiao Y; Miao G; Yang C; Zeng M,"PURPOSE: To compare the imaging features, pathologic characteristics, and survival outcomes between subcentimeter and 1-2 cm hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). METHODS: This retrospective observational study evaluated the imaging features and medical records of patients with HCC smaller than 2 cm who underwent surgical resection with preoperative gadoxetic-acid-enhanced MRI (EOB-MRI) from January 2013 to December 2021. The incidence of EOB-MRI features and pathological characteristics between the subcentimeter and 1-2 cm HCC were compared. The recurrence-free survival (RFS), including early and overall tumor recurrence, and overall survival (OS) were assessed. RESULTS: A total of 223 patients (82 with subcentimeter HCC and 141 with 1-2 cm HCC, 179 men) were enrolled. Compared with 1-2 cm HCC, subcentimeter HCC showed fewer restricted diffusion (87.8 vs. 95.7%, P = 0.027), portal-phase washout (58.5% vs. 73.8%, P = 0.013), typical enhancement pattern (50.0% vs. 66.7%, P =0.014), and microvascular invasion (4.9% vs. 14.9%, P = 0.022). Patients with subcentimeter HCC had higher RFS (P = 0.027) and better OS (P = 0.029). The estimated RFS rates at 5 years was 83.3% for subcentimeter HCC and 67.3% for 1-2 cm HCC, respectively. The estimated OS rates at 5 years was 97.3% for subcentimeter HCC and 89.5% for 1-2 cm HCC, respectively. CONCLUSION: Subcentimeter HCC showed less frequent EOB-MRI features seen typically in 1-2 cm HCC but better survival outcomes.

314,Abstinence is associated with better outcomes in patients with alcohol-related hepatocellular carcinoma: Results of an observational study.,Donati A; Henrion J; Regnier M; Deltenre P; Marot A,"BACKGROUND: Patients with alcohol-related cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) may have reduced survival compared to those with HCC related to other causes. The impact of abstinence in alcohol-related HCC is unknown. We compared access to curative treatment and the prognosis of patients with HCC according to the cause of cirrhosis and evaluated the impact of abstinence on the prognosis of patients with alcohol-related HCC. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Data for patients with cirrhosis and HCC were prospectively collected in a single center. A logistic regression model was used to identify factors associated with access to curative treatment. Multivariate Fine and Gray proportional hazards models were used to identify factors associated with 5-year survival after adjustment for lead-time bias. RESULTS: Two hundred patients were included, 114 (57 %) with non-alcohol-related HCC and 86 (43 %) with alcohol-related HCC (35 abstainers, 51 consumers). During follow-up, 21 patients were transplanted and 156 died. The proportion of patients who had access to curative treatment was 65 % in abstainers, 44 % in consumers, and 57 % in patients with non-alcohol-related cirrhosis (p = 0.06). In multivariate analyses, abstinence was not associated with better access to curative treatment. After adjustment for lead-time bias, the 5-year cumulative incidence of overall death was significantly lower in abstainers than in consumers and in patients with non-alcohol-related cirrhosis (52 % vs. 78 % vs. 81 %, respectively, p = 0.04). In multivariate analyses, abstainers had lower risk of death than consumers (SHR: 0.47, 95 % CI: 0.28-0.80, p = 0.005).

316,VIR-2218 (elebsiran) plus pegylated interferon-alfa-2a in participants with chronic hepatitis B virus infection: a phase 2 study.,Yuen MF; Lim YS; Yoon KT; Lim TH; Heo J; Tangkijvanich P; Tak WY; Thanawala V; Cloutier D; Mao S; Arizpe A; Cathcart AL; Gupta SV; Hwang C; Gane E,"BACKGROUND: Chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) remains a global concern, with current treatments achieving low rates of HBsAg seroclearance. VIR-2218 (elebsiran), a small interfering RNA agent against HBV transcripts, reduces HBsAg concentrations. We aimed to evaluate the safety and antiviral activity of VIR-2218 with and without pegylated interferon-alpha-2a treatment in participants with chronic HBV. METHODS: This open-label, phase 2 study was conducted at 23 sites in six countries (New Zealand, Australia, Hong Kong, Thailand, South Korea, and Malaysia). Adults (aged 18-65 years) with chronic HBV infection without cirrhosis and with HBsAg more than 50 IU/mL and HBV DNA less than 90 IU/mL who were on continued nucleoside or nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI) therapy for 2 months or longer were eligible. Participants were enrolled into one of six cohorts to receive VIR-2218 200 mg subcutaneously every 4 weeks, with or without 180 μg subcutaneous pegylated interferon-alfa-2a once per week. Cohort 1 received six doses of VIR-2218 (total 20 weeks); cohort 2 received six doses of VIR-2218 starting at day 1, plus 12 doses of pegylated interferon-alfa-2a starting at week 12 (total 24 weeks); cohort 3 received six doses of VIR-2218 and 24 doses of pegylated interferon-alfa-2a (total 24 weeks); cohort 4 received six doses of VIR-2218 and up to 48 doses of pegylated interferon-alfa-2a (total 48 weeks); cohort 5 received up to 13 doses of VIR-2218 and up to 44 doses of pegylated interferon-alfa-2a (total 48 weeks); and cohort 6 received three doses of VIR-2218 and 12 doses of pegylated interferon-alfa-2a (total 12 weeks). The primary endpoints were the incidence of adverse events and clinical assessments (including results of laboratory tests). Secondary endpoints were the mean maximum reduction of serum HBsAg at any timepoint; the proportion of participants with serum HBsAg seroclearance at any timepoint and for more than 6 months after the end of treatment; and the proportion of participants with anti-HBs seroconversion at any timepoint. For patients who were HBeAg-positive, we also assessed the proportion with HBeAg seroclearance or anti-HBe seroconversion at any timepoint. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03672188, and is ongoing. FINDINGS: Between July 2, 2020, and Nov 2, 2021, 124 individuals were screened for eligibility, 84 of whom were enrolled (15 in cohort 1, 15 in cohort 2, 18 in cohort 3, 18 in cohort 4, 13 in cohort 5, and five in cohort 6). Participants were predominantly HBeAg-negative, Asian, and male (66 [79%] participants were male and 18 [21%] were female). Most treatment emergent adverse events were grades 1-2. Three (20%) participants in cohort 1, four (27%) in cohort 2, eight (44%) in cohort 3, seven (39%) in cohort 4, six (46%) in cohort 5, and two (40%) in cohort 6 reported treatment-emergent adverse events related to VIR-2218. 12 (80%) participants in cohort 2, 12 (67%) in cohort 3, 14 (78%) in cohort 4, 13 (100%) in cohort 5, and three (60%) in cohort 6 reported treatment-emergent adverse events related to pegylated interferon-alfa-2a. Two (13%) participants in cohort 1 had elevations in alanine aminotransferase, compared with 13 (87%) participants in cohort 2, 15 (83%) in cohort 3, 17 (94%) in cohort 4, 11 (85%) in cohort 5, and three (60%) in cohort 6. The mean maximum change from baseline at any timepoint in HBsAg concentration was -2·0 log(10) IU/mL (95% CI -2·1 to -1·8) in cohort 1, -2·2 log(10) IU/mL (-2·5 to -1·8) in cohort 2, -2·5 log(10) IU/mL (-2·8 to -2·1) in cohort 3, -2·4 log(10) IU/mL (-3·1 to -1·8) in cohort 4, -3·0 log(10) IU/mL (-3·7 to -2·3) in cohort 5, and -1·7 log(10) IU/mL (-2·1 to -1·4) in cohort 6. 11 participants (one in cohort 2, one in cohort 3, five in cohort 4, and four in cohort 5) receiving VIR-2218 plus pegylated interferon-alfa-2a had HBsAg seroclearance at any timepoint. Of these, ten (91%; one in cohort 2, five in cohort 4, and four in cohort 5) had anti-HBs seropositivity. Six participants (one in cohort 2, three in cohort 4, and two in cohort 5) had sustained HBsAg seroclearance through to 24 weeks after the end of treatment. No participants receiving VIR-2218 monotherapy (cohort 1) or VIR-2218 plus pegylated interferon-alfa-2a 12-week regimen (cohort 6) had HBsAg seroclearance. 12 (42%) of 26 participants (one of four in cohort 1, two of six in cohort 2, four of seven in cohort 3, four of six in cohort 4, and one of three in cohort 5) who were HBeAg positive at baseline had HBeAg seroclearance or anti-HBe seroconversion. INTERPRETATION: The results of this phase 2 study support further development of VIR-2218 as a potential therapy for patients with chronic HBV infection.

317,Incremental high power radiofrequency ablation with multi-electrodes for small hepatocellular carcinoma: a prospective study.,Hwang S; Kim JH; Yu SJ; Lee JM,"Radiofrequency ablation (RFA) offers a minimally invasive treatment for small hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), but it faces challenges such as high local recurrence rates. This prospective study, conducted from January 2020 to July 2022, evaluated a novel approach using a three-channel, dual radiofrequency (RF) generator with separable clustered electrodes to improve RFA's efficacy and safety. The study employed a high-power, gradual, stepwise RFA method on HCCs (≤ 4 cm), utilizing real-time ultrasound-computed tomography (CT)/magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) fusion imaging. Involving 110 participants with 116 HCCs, the study reported no major complications. Local tumor progression (LTP) and intrahepatic remote recurrence (IRR) rates were low, with promising cumulative incidences at 1, 2, and 3 years for LTP (0.9%, 3.6%, 7.0%) and IRR (13.9%, 20.5%, 31.4%). Recurrence-free survival (RFS) rates were similarly encouraging: LTP (99.1%, 96.4%, 93.0%) and IRR (86.1%, 79.5%, 68.6%). This innovative gradual, incremental high-power RFA technique, featuring a dual switching monopolar mode and three electrodes, represents an effective and safer management option for small HCCs.

METHODS: The clinicopathological data of 200 HCC patients were collected and randomly divided into training set and validation set according to the ratio of 7:3. The correlation between MVI occurrence and primary disease, age, gender, tumor size, tumor stage, and immunohistochemical characteristics of 13 proteins, including GPC3, CK19 and vimentin, were statistically analyzed. Univariate and multivariate analyzes identified risk factors and independent risk factors, respectively. A nomogram model that can be used to predict the presence of MVI was subsequently constructed. Then, receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve, calibration curve, and decision curve analysis (DCA) were conducted to assess the performance of the model. RESULTS: Multivariate logistic regression analysis indicated that tumor size, GPC3, P53, RRM1, BRCA1, and ARG were independent risk factors for MVI. A nomogram was constructed based on the above six predictors. ROC curve, calibration, and DCA analysis demonstrated the good performance and the clinical application potential of the nomogram model.

METHODS: A total of 67 patients with 106 lesions were identified after screening 538 patients who underwent gadoxetic acid-enhanced MRI within the SORAMIC trial. All patients were allocated to the trial treatment according to the trial scheme, and 61 of 67 patients received systemic treatment with sorafenib (either alone or combined with locoregional therapies) during the trial period. Follow-up images after treatment according to trial scheme were reviewed for subsequent hypervascularization or > 1 cm size increase. The correlation between progression and several imaging and clinical parameters was assessed using univariable and multivariable analyses. RESULTS: On a median 178 (range, 48-1072) days follow-up period, progression was encountered in 18 (16.9%) lesions in 12 (17.9%) patients. In univariable analysis size > 12.6 mm (p = 0.070), ECOG-PS (p = 0.025), hypointensity at T1-weighted imaging (p = 0.028), hyperintensity at T2-weighted imaging (p < 0.001), hyperintensity at DWI images (p = 0.007), and cirrhosis (p = 0.065) were correlated with progression during follow-up. Hyperintensity at T2 images (p = 0.011) was an independent risk factor for progression in multivariable analysis, as well as cirrhosis (p = 0.033) and ECOG-PS (p = 0.030). CONCLUSIONS: Non-hypervascular hepatobiliary phase hypointense lesions are associated with subsequent progression after treatment in patients with HCC. T2 hyperintensity, diffusion restriction, cirrhosis, and higher ECOG-PS could identify lesions with increased risk. These factors should be considered for further diagnostic evaluation or treatment of such lesions. KEY POINTS: • Non-hypervascular hepatobiliary phase hypointense lesions have considerable risk of progression in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma receiving treatment. • T2 hyperintensity, cirrhosis, ECOG-PS, and hyperintensity at DWI are associated with increased risk of progression. • Non-hypervascular hepatobiliary phase hypointense lesions should be considered in the decision-making process of locoregional therapies, especially in the presence of these risk factors.",False,"Intervention is not immunotherapy or targeted therapy, and study design is not an RCT.",patients with hepatocellular carcinoma,systemic treatment with sorafenib,not specified,progression of non-hypervascular hepatobiliary phase hypointense lesions,analysis within the SORAMIC trial,False,Intervention is not immunotherapy or targeted therapy and study design is not an RCT,-,-,-,-,-,,No disagreement between Model A and B,False
320,Detection of hepatocellular carcinoma feeding vessels: MDCT angiography with 3D reconstruction versus digital subtraction angiography.,Ahmed RM; Ali WA; AbdelHakam AM; Ahmed SH,"BACKGROUND: Accurate detection of Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) feeding vessels during transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (TACE) is important for an effective treatment, while limiting non-target embolization. This study aimed to investigate the feasibility and accuracy of pre-TACE three dimensional (3D) CT angiography for tumor-feeding vessels detection compared to DSA. METHODS: Sixty-nine consecutive patients referred for TACE from May 2022 to May 2023 were included. (3D) CT images were reconstructed from the pre-TACE diagnostic multiphasic contrast enhanced CT images and compared with non-selective digital subtraction angiography (DSA) images obtained during TACE for detection of HCC feeding vessels. A ""Ground truth"" made by consensus between observers after reviewing all available pre-TACE CT images, and DSA and CBCT images during TACE to detect the true feeding vessels was the gold standard. Sensitivity, specificity, negative predictive value (NPV), positive predictive value (PPV), accuracy and ROC curve with AUC were calculated for each modality and compared. RESULTS: A total of 136 active HCCs were detected in the 69 consecutive patients included in the study. 185 feeding arteries were detected by 3D CT and DSA and included in the analysis. 3D CT detection of feeding arteries revealed mean sensitivity, specificity, PPV, NPV and accuracy of 91%, 71%, 98%, 36%, and 90%, respectively, with mean AUC = 0.81. DSA detection of feeding arteries revealed mean sensitivity, specificity, PPV, NPV, and accuracy of 80%, 58%, 96.5%, 16.5% and 78%, respectively, with mean AUC = 0.69. CONCLUSIONS: Pre-TACE 3D CT angiography has shown promise in improving the detection of HCC feeding vessels compared to DSA.

METHODS: Between December 2021 and June 2022, patients underwent high-power MWA for liver, lung, and kidney tumors. A retrospective observational study was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. The MWA system utilized a 150-W, 2.45-GHz microwave generator (Emprint™ HP Ablation System, Medtronic). The study assessed technical success, safety, and effectiveness, considering pre- and post-treatment diameter and volume, lesion location, biopsy and/or cone beam computed tomography (CBCT) usage, MWA ablation time, MWA power, and dose-area product (DAP). RESULTS: From December 2021 to June 2022, 16 patients were enrolled for high-power MWA. Treated lesions included hepatocellular carcinoma (10), liver metastasis from colon cancer (1), liver metastasis from pancreatic cancer (1), squamous cell lung carcinoma (2), renal cell carcinoma (1), and renal oncocytoma (1). Technical success rate was 100%. One grade 1 complication (6.25%) was reported according to CIRSE classification. Overall effectiveness was 92.8%. Pre- and post-treatment mean diameters for liver lesions were 19.9 mm and 37.5 mm, respectively; for kidney lesions, 34 mm and 35 mm; for lung lesions, 29.5 mm and 31.5 mm.

Data on preoperative chemotherapy for advanced HCC is still limited. Poor prognostic factors of HCC after resection are tumor more than 5 cm in diameter, multiple lesions, and gross tumor thrombosis, which constitute UICC7 Stage IIIA and IIIB HCC. There are no prospective studies about preoperative chemotherapy in these patients. AIM: To evaluate the benefit of preoperative chemotherapy for UICC7 Stage IIIA and IIIB potentially resectable HCC. DISCUSSION: Our recent study demonstrated that the 5-year overall survival rate (OS) of patients diagnosed as UICC7 Stage IIIA and IIIB who had received upfront resection was only 16.5%. In contrast, the 5-year OS of UICC7 Stage IIIA and IIIB initially unresectable patients who had achieved conversion from unresectable to resect able status under successful hepatic infusion chemotherapy prior to resection was as high as 61.3%. Additionally, recent studies reported transarterial chemoembolization achieved outcomes comparable with those of resection. Therefore, we believe that patients with UICC7 Stage IIIA and IIIB should be considered borderline resectable.

The median maximum PLT in lusutrombopag group increased to 80.5 × 10(9)/L, and median time to reach maximum was 14.5 days. Compared with placebo, the lusutrombopag group had a lower incidence of bleeding events (6.8% versus 13.6%), and only one patient had thrombotic-related AE. Overall, the incidence of treatment-emergent AEs was comparable between two groups.

325,Initial therapeutic results of atezolizumab plus bevacizumab for unresectable advanced hepatocellular carcinoma and the importance of hepatic functional reserve.,Tomonari T; Tani J; Sato Y; Tanaka H; Tanaka T; Taniguchi T; Asahiro M; Okamoto K; Sogabe M; Miyamoto H; Muguruma N; Masaki T; Takayama T,"AIM: We analyzed the association between the modified albumin-bilirubin (mALBI) grade and therapeutic efficacy of atezolizumab plus bevacizumab (Atezo+Bev) for the treatment of unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (u-HCC). METHODS: In this retrospective observational study, we included 71 u-HCC patients treated with Atezo+Bev between September 2020 and September 2021. Patients were grouped corresponding to the mALBI grade at the start of treatment (mALBI 1+2a or mALBI 2b+3) and analyzed for therapeutic effect and the transition rate to secondary treatment. RESULTS: According to the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors, the overall response rate was significantly higher for the mALBI 1+2a group, than for the mALBI 2b+3 group, with 26.2% and 3.4%, respectively. The progression-free survival (PFS) was significantly longer in the mALBI 1+2a group (10.5 months) than in the mALBI 2b+3 group (3.0 months). In the multivariate analysis, an mALBI of 1+2a was found to be an independent factor of PFS.

The aim of this study was to investigate the incidence and risk factors for CIA development, and if CIA is a useful predictor of long-term renal dysfunction after cisplatin treatment. METHODS: This was a retrospective, single-center, observational, longitudinal follow-up, large cohort study in adult patients with solid tumors treated with cisplatin-based systematic chemotherapy. Electronic medical records were used for all demographic and medical data. AKI was defined by Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) criteria. We assessed long-term renal dysfunction using %ΔeGFR/Y; (the last eGFR value during follow-up)-(the baseline eGFR)/(the baseline eGFR)/year of follow-up × 100. RESULTS: A total of 2191 patients received 8,482 cycles of cisplatin. CIA was observed 359 times (4.2%). Significant risk factors for developing CIA, using multiple linear regression analysis, included: cisplatin administration immediately before the onset of CIA (p < 0.01), liver cancer (p = 0.02), colon cancer (p = 0.04), hypertension (p = 0.03), high estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) (p < 0.01), and high C-reactive protein (CRP) (p = 0.04).

MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this prospective trial, 50 patients with HCC were randomly assigned to MWA or RFA treatment. MRI was performed 24 h before and after ablation and subsequently in 3-month intervals. Ablation volumes, ablation durations, adverse events (AE), technique efficacy, technical success, local tumor progression (LTP), disease-free survival (DFS), intrahepatic distant recurrence (IDR), and overall survival (OS) rates were evaluated. RESULTS: The mean ablation volume was 66.5 cm³ for MWA and 29.2  cm³ for RFA (p < 0.01). The mean ablation durations for MWA and RFA were 11.2 ± 4.0 min and 16.3 ± 4.7 min, respectively (p < 0.01). Six mild AEs were documented (p > 0.05). All treatments had a technical success rate and a technique efficacy rate of 100 % (50/50, p = 1.00). LTP within 2 years occurred in 1/25 (4 %) in the MWA group and in 4/25 (16 %) in the RFA group (p = 0.06). IDR within 2 years was 8/25 (32 %) for MWA and 14/25 (56 %) for RFA (p < 0.05). The median DFS was 24.5 months and 13.4 months for MWA and RFA, respectively (p = 0.02).

329,Outcomes of patients with hepatorenal syndrome undergoing liver transplantation in the era of terlipressin.,Terbah R; Cao J; Wong D; Lim PCH; Gow P; Testro A; Sinclair M,"BACKGROUND: The efficacy of terlipressin in improving pre-liver transplant renal function in hepatorenal syndrome (HRS) has been well documented, however, its impact on post-transplant renal function remains poorly described. This study aims to describe the impact of HRS and terlipressin on post-liver transplant renal function and survival. METHODS: A single-centre, retrospective, observational study was conducted to identify post-transplant outcomes of patients diagnosed with HRS undergoing liver transplant (HRS cohort) and those undergoing transplant for non-HRS, non-hepatocellular carcinoma cirrhotic indications (comparator cohort) between January 1997 and March 2020. The primary outcome was serum creatinine at 180 days post-liver transplant. Other renal outcomes and overall survival were secondary outcomes. RESULTS: 109 patients with HRS and 502 comparator patients underwent liver transplant. The comparator cohort was younger than the HRS cohort (53 vs. 57 years, P < 0.001). The median creatinine at day 180 post-transplant was higher in the HRS transplant group (119 µmol/L vs. 103 µmol/L, P < 0.001), however, this association lost significance following multivariate analysis. Seven patients (7%) in the HRS cohort received a combined liver-kidney transplant. There was no significant difference in the 12-month post-transplant survival between the two groups (94% vs. 94%, P = 0.5). CONCLUSION: Patients with HRS treated with terlipressin who subsequently undergo liver transplantation have post-transplant renal and survival outcomes comparable to patients transplanted for cirrhosis without HRS.

330,Chemoembolization combined radiofrequency ablation vs. chemoembolization alone for treatment of beyond the Milan criteria viable hepatocellular carcinoma (CERFA): study protocol for a randomized controlled trial.,Lee SK; Yang H; Kwon JH; Shim DJ; Kim D; Nam SW; Yoo SH; Bae SH; Lee A; Lee YJ; Jeon C; Jang JW; Sung PS; Chun HJ; Kim SH; Choi JI; Oh JS; Yang YJ,"BACKGROUND: Many previous studies evaluated a combination of transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (TACE) and radiofrequency ablation (RFA) for treating early hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC); however, studies evaluating combination therapy for beyond-the-Milan criteria HCC are scarce. METHODS: A total of 120 patients with beyond-the-Milan criteria HCC who have viable tumour after first TACE will be enrolled in this multi-institutional, parallel, pragmatic, randomized controlled trial. Patients with metastasis, vascular invasion, or a sum of tumour diameter > 8 cm will be excluded. Eligible patients will be randomly assigned to combination TACE and RFA therapy or TACE monotherapy groups. Patients in the combination therapy group will receive a second TACE and subsequent RFA at the viable tumour. Patients in the TACE monotherapy group will receive only second TACE. Patients in both groups will undergo magnetic resonance imaging 4-6 weeks after second TACE. The primary endpoint is 1-month tumour response, and secondary endpoints are progression-free survival, overall response rate, number of treatments until CR, overall survival, and change in liver function. DISCUSSION: Although TACE can be used to treat intermediate-stage HCC, it is difficult to achieve CR by first TACE in most intermediate-stage patients. Recent studies show a survival advantage of combination therapy over monotherapy. However, most studies evaluating combination therapy included patients with a single tumour sized < 5 cm, and no studies included patients with intermediate-stage but more advanced (i.e., beyond-the-Milan criteria) HCC.

331,Short-term efficacy assessment of transarterial chemoembolization combined with radioactive iodine therapy in primary hepatocellular carcinoma.,Wang L; Huang K; Zhang Y; Wu YF; Yue ZD; Fan ZH; Liu FQ; Li YW; Dong J,"BACKGROUND: Transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) is an effective treatment for primary hepatocellular carcinoma (PHC). Radioactive iodine therapy has been used in the treatment of advanced PHC, especially in patients with portal vein tumor thrombosis. However, data on the therapeutic effect of TACE combined with radioactive iodine therapy in PHC are scarce. AIM: To investigate the clinical efficacy of TACE combined with radioactive iodine implantation therapy in advanced PHC via perfusion computed tomography (CT). METHODS: For this study, 98 advanced PHC patients were recruited and divided randomly into the study and control groups. Patients in the study group were treated with TACE combined radioactive iodine implantation therapy. Patients in the control group were treated with only TACE. The tumor lesion length, clinical effect, serum alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) and CT perfusion parameters were compared before and after therapy, and statistical analysis was performed. RESULTS: There was no significant difference in tumor length and serum AFP between the study and control groups (P > 0.05) before treatment. However, the tumor length and serum AFP in the study group were lower than those in the control group 1 mo and 3 mo after therapy. After 3 mo of treatment, the complete and partial remission rate of the study group was 93.88%, which was significantly higher than the control group (77.55%) (P < 0.05). Before treatment, there were no significant differences between the two groups on the perfusion CT variables, including the lesion blood volume, permeability surface, blood flow, hepatic artery flow and mean transit time (P > 0.05). After 3 mo of treatment, all perfusion CT variables were lower in the study group compared to the control group (P < 0.05). The survival time of patients in the study group was 22 mo compared to 18 mo in the control group, which was significantly different [log rank (Mantel-Cox) = 4.318, P = 0.038]. CONCLUSION: TACE combined with radioactive iodine implantation in the treatment of advanced PHC can inhibit the formation of blood vessels in tumor tissue and reduce the perfusion level of tumor lesions, thereby improving the clinical efficacy and prolonging the survival time of patients. reserved.",False,"Population and intervention match, but the comparison is not standard therapy or placebo, and outcomes include more than survival or response rate.",advanced PHC patients,TACE combined with radioactive iodine implantation therapy,TACE alone,"tumor lesion length, clinical effect, serum AFP, CT perfusion parameters, survival time",randomized controlled trial,False,Population and intervention match but comparison is not standard therapy or placebo.

332,Diffusion-Weighted Imaging as a Quantitative Imaging Biomarker for Predicting Proliferation Rate in Hepatocellular Carcinoma: Developing a Radiomics Nomogram.,Yan C; Han Z; Chen X; Gao L; Ye R; Li Y,"PURPOSE: This study aimed to explore the predictive performance of diffusion-weighted imaging with apparent diffusion coefficient map in predicting the proliferation rate of hepatocellular carcinoma and to develop a radiomics-based nomogram. METHODS: This was a single-center retrospective study. A total of 110 patients were enrolled. The sample included 38 patients with low Ki67 expression (Ki67 ≤10%) and 72 with high Ki67 expression (Ki67 >10%) as demonstrated by surgical pathology. Patients were randomly divided into either a training (n = 77) or validation (n = 33) cohort. Diffusion-weighted imaging with apparent diffusion coefficient maps was used to extract radiomic features and the signal intensity values of tumor (SI tumor ), normal liver (SI liver ), and background noise (SI background ) from all samples. Subsequently, the clinical model, radiomic model, and fusion model (with clinical data and radiomic signature) were developed and validated. RESULTS: The area under the curve (AUC) of the clinical model for predicting the Ki67 expression including serum α-fetoprotein level ( P = 0.010), age ( P = 0.015), and signal noise ratio ( P = 0.026) was 0.799 and 0.715 in training and validation cohorts, respectively.

METHODS: In this prospective, single-institution ethics-approved study, 101 cirrhotic patients were enrolled consecutively from the pre-LT clinic with written informed consent. Patients underwent CECT and EOB-MRI alternately every 3 months until LT or study exclusion. Two blinded radiologists independently scored hepatic lesions on CECT and EOB-MRI utilizing the liver imaging reporting and data system (LI-RADS) version 2018. Liver explant histopathology was the reference standard. Pre-LT eligibility accuracies with EOB-MRI and CECT as per Milan criteria (MC) were assessed in reference to post-LT explant histopathology. Lesion-level and patient-level statistical analyses were performed. RESULTS: Sixty patients (49 men; age 33-72 years) underwent LT successfully. One hundred four non-treated HCC and 42 viable HCC in previously treated HCC were identified at explant histopathology. For LR-4/5 category lesions, EOB-MRI had a higher pooled sensitivity (86.7% versus 75.3%, p <  0.001) but lower specificity (84.6% versus 100%, p <  0.001) compared to CECT. EOB-MRI had a sensitivity twice that of CECT (65.9% versus 32.2%, p <  0.001) when all HCC identified at explant histopathology were included in the analysis instead of imaging visible lesions only. Disregarding the hepatobiliary phase resulted in a significant drop in EOB-MRI performance (86.7 to 72.8%, p <  0.001). EOB-MRI had significantly lower pooled sensitivity and specificity versus CECT in the LR5 category with lesion size < 2 cm (50% versus 79%, p = 0.002 and 88.9% versus 100%, p = 0.002). EOB-MRI had higher sensitivity (84.8% versus 75%, p <  0.037) compared to CECT for detecting < 2 cm viable HCC in treated lesions. Accuracies of LT eligibility assessment were comparable between EOB-MRI (90-91.7%, p = 0.156) and CECT (90-95%, p = 0.158). CONCLUSION: EOB-MRI had superior sensitivity for HCC detection; however, with lower specificity compared to CECT in LR4/5 category lesions while it was inferior to CECT in the LR5 category under 2 cm. The accuracy for LT eligibility assessment based on MC was not significantly different between EOB-MRI and CECT.

All patients underwent NH; 76 patients who received PORT following NH in the phase II study were assigned to the NH + RT group, and 171 who underwent NH alone were assigned to the NH group. Propensity score matching (PSM) was used to balance clinicopathological characteristic differences between groups. RESULTS: Before PSM, the 5-year overall survival (OS) rates between groups differed significantly (72.2 % vs 60.7 %, P = 0.017). Moreover, the 5-year disease-free survival (DFS) rate was significantly higher in the NH + RT group (51.4 % vs 35.7 %, P = 0.002).

MATERIALS AND METHODS: A consecutive series of patients with HCC scheduled for locoregional treatment were enrolled between April 2021 and March 2023. Patients were randomly divided into 3D-CEUS/MRI-CEUS fusion imaging group (3D/fusion group) or 2D-CEUS group (2D group). CEUS was performed 1 week before and 4-6 weeks after locoregional treatment. Contrast-enhanced MRI (CE-MRI) 4-6 weeks after treatment was set as the reference standard. CEUS images were evaluated for the presence or absence of viable tumors. Diagnostic performance criteria, including sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, and area under the curve (AUC), were determined for each modality. RESULTS: A total of 140 patients were included, 70 patients in the 2D group (mean age, 60.2 ± 10.4 years) and 70 patients in the 3D/fusion group (mean age, 59.8 ± 10.6 years). The sensitivity of the 3D/fusion group was 100.0% (95% CI: 75.9, 100.0), higher than that of the 2D group (55.6%, 95% CI: 22.7, 84.7; p = 0.019). The specificity of the 3D/fusion group was 96.3% (95% CI: 86.2, 99.4), which was comparable to that of the 2D group (98.4%, 95% CI: 90.0, 99.9; p = 0.915).

337,Proposed carbohydrate antigen 19-9 (CA19-9) cut-off values for the detection of pancreatic cancer in patients with poorly controlled diabetes: a real-world study.,Yamada T; Minami T; Yamada M; Terauchi Y,"CA19-9 is a tumor marker for pancreatic cancer (PC), and the nondiabetic cut-off level is 37 U/mL. CA19-9 levels are said to rise in patients with tumors like PC and intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm (IPMN). CA19-9 levels have also been shown to be related to HbA1c levels. We hypothesized that the CA19-9 cut-off levels would differ between patients with poorly controlled diabetes. This real-world trial was designed to test our hypotheses. This was a retrospective cohort study. All inpatients with poorly controlled diabetes had mean HbA1c levels of 10.0% and were divided into three groups: those with pancreatic cancer (PC group, N = 20), those with IPMN (IPMN group, N = 55), and those with neither (NC group, N = 985). Serum CA19-9 levels in the PC group were significantly higher than in the IPMN and NC groups (p < 0.001). CA19-9 levels did not differ statistically between the IPMN and NC groups. According to the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis, serum CA19-9 levels of 98.4 U/mL had the highest sensitivity and specificity to detect PC, when comparing PC to IPMN + NC groups. Using this cut-off, the sensitivity and specificity of CA19-9 for PC were 70.0% and 96.5%, respectively, with a 0.81 area under the ROC curve. CA19-9 levels in two inpatients were >98.4 U/mL, most likely due to hepatocellular carcinoma and esophageal cancer. CA19-9 cut-off levels were thought to be 98.4 U/mL.

338,Experience with direct-acting antivirals in genotype 1-5 infected chronic hepatitis C patients in Turkey.,Sahin A; Akay O,"BACKGROUND: Hepatitis C virus (HCV) can cause chronic liver disease, hepatic cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma, liver transplantation, and death. Early diagnosis and treatment are thus vital. OBJECTIVES: We aimed to investigate the sustained virological response (SVR) rates in chronic hepatitis C patients infected with different genotypes, receiving different direct-acting antiviral treatments (DAAs). DESIGN: Retrospective, observational SETTING: Clinic for infectious diseases and clinical microbiology PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients diagnosed with chronic hepatitis C who applied to our outpatient clinic between January 2016 and November 2022 and were treated with a DAA were included in the study. Treatment responses were evaluated after each patient was treated with either ledipasvir plus sofosbuvir (LDV/SOF), LDV/SOF + ribavirin (RBV), SOF+RBV, ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir plus dasabuvir (OBV/PTV/r±DSV) ±RBV, or glecaprevir plus pibrentasvir (GLE/PIB). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Sustained virological response (SVR) rates at 12 weeks (SVR12) post-treatment. SAMPLE SIZE: 360 patients. RESULTS: Of 360 patients who met the inclusion criteria, 218 (60.6%) were male and 142 (39.4%) were female with no statistically significant differences in SVR between sexes (P=.252). Nearly all had a SVR (n=353, 98.1%). The median (IQR) age of the patients was 56 (30.3) years. There were 42 (11.7%), 199 (55.3%), 4 (1.1%), 106 (29.4%), 8 (2.2%) and 1 (0.3%) patient with genotypes 1a, 1b, 2, 3, 4 and 5, respectively, and SVR12 did not differ significantly between genotypes (P=.066). SVR12 response was higher in 246 (68.3%) non-injecting drug users compared to 114 (31.7%) injecting drug users (P=.005). The SVR12 response was achieved in 100% of patients with genotypes 1a, 2, 4, and 5. SVR12 response could not be obtained in 1 of 199 genotype 1b patients and 6 of 106 genotype 3 patients. The common feature of 6 reinfection patients with genotype 3 was that they were using intravenous drugs. These 6 patients were reinfected due to their continued intravenous drug use. CONCLUSION: In conclusion, DAAs provide high SVR12 rates in cirrhotic/non-cirrhotic, pegylated interferon-naive/experienced patient groups and in patients infected with all genotypes.

However, the surgical technique needs to be improved. The present study aimed to evaluate the ""no-touch"" technique in LT. METHODS: From January 2018 to December 2019, we performed a prospective randomized controlled trial on HCC patients who underwent LT. The patients were randomized into two groups: a no-touch technique LT group (NT group, n = 38) and a conventional LT technique group (CT group, n = 46). Operative outcomes and survival in the two groups were analyzed. RESULTS: The perioperative parameters were comparable between the two groups (P > 0.05). There was no significant difference between the two groups in disease-free survival (DFS) (P = 0.732) or overall survival (OS) (P = 0.891). Of 36 patients who were beyond the Hangzhou criteria for LT, the DFS of the patients in the NT group was significantly longer than that in the CT group (median 402 vs. 126 days, P = 0.025). In 31 patients who had portal vein tumor thrombosis (PVTT), DFS and OS in the NT group were significantly better than those in the CT group (median DFS 420 vs. 167 days, P = 0.022; 2-year OS rate 93.8% vs. 66.7%, P = 0.043). In 14 patients who had diffuse-type HCCs, DFS and OS were significantly better in the NT group than those in the CT group (median DFS 141 vs. 56 days, P = 0.008; 2-year OS rate 75.0% vs. 33.3%, P = 0.034).

340,Clinical characteristics and management of patients with nonalcoholic steatohepatitis in a real-world setting: analysis of the Ipsos NASH therapy monitor database.,Shelley K; Articolo A; Luthra R; Charlton M,"BACKGROUND: Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is the more severe, inflammatory type of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). NASH, a leading indication for liver transplantation, is growing in prevalence. The extent of liver fibrosis, ranging from fibrosis stage (FS) of none (F0) to cirrhosis (F4), is a strong predictor of health outcomes. There is little information on patient demographics and clinical characteristics by fibrosis stage and NASH treatment outside of academic medical centers. METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional observational study using Ipsos' syndicated NASH Therapy Monitor database, consisting of medical chart audits provided by sampled NASH-treating physicians in the United States in 2016 (n = 174) and 2017 (n = 164). Data was collected online. RESULTS: Of 2,366 patients reported on by participating physicians and included in the analysis, 68% had FS F0-F2, 21% had bridging fibrosis (F3), and 9% had cirrhosis (F4). Common comorbidities were type 2 diabetes (56%), hyperlipidemia (44%), hypertension (46%), and obesity (42%). Patients with more advanced fibrosis scores (F3-F4) had higher comorbidity rates than patients with F0-F2. Commonly used diagnostic tests included ultrasound (80%), liver biopsy (78%), AST/ALT ratio (43%), NAFLD fibrosis score (25%), transient elastography (23%), NAFLD liver fat score (22%), and Fatty Liver Index (19%). Most commonly prescribed medications were vitamin E (53%), statins (51%), metformin (47%), angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (28%), and beta blockers (22%). Medications were commonly prescribed for reasons other than their known effects. CONCLUSION: Physicians in this study, drawn from a spectrum of practice settings, relied on ultrasound and liver biopsy for diagnosis and vitamin E, statins, and metformin for pharmacological treatment of NASH. These findings imply poor adherence to guidelines in the diagnosis and management of NAFLD and NASH. Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is a liver disease caused by excess fat in the liver which can lead to liver inflammation and scarring (fibrosis), ranging from stage F0 (no scarring) to F4 (advanced scarring). The stage of liver scarring can predict the likelihood of future health problems, including liver failure and liver cancer. However, we do not fully understand how patient characteristics may vary at different stages of liver scarring. We looked at medical information from physicians treating patients diagnosed with NASH to understand how patient characteristics might differ based on the severity of their liver scarring. The majority (68%) of patients were stage F0-F2, with 30% having advanced scarring (F3-F4). In addition to NASH, many patients also had type 2 diabetes, high cholesterol, high blood pressure, and obesity. Patients with more advanced scarring (F3-F4) were more likely to have these diseases than patients with less severe disease (F0-F2). Diagnosis of NASH by participating physicians was based on tests including imaging (ultrasound, CT scan, MRI), liver biopsy, blood tests, and whether patients had other conditions that would put them at risk for NASH. The medications that the doctors prescribed most often to their patients included vitamin E and drugs to treat high cholesterol, high blood pressure, or diabetes. Medications were frequently prescribed for reasons other than their known effects. By understanding how patient characteristics vary by stages of liver scarring and how NASH is currently managed may help guide the evaluation and treatment of NASH when NASH-specific therapies become available.",False,Population does not match; intervention and outcome do not match target criteria; study design is not a randomized controlled trial.,patients with NASH,"vitamin E, statins, metformin",not specified,diagnosis and management of NAFLD and NASH,cross-sectional observational study,False,"Population matches but intervention and outcome do not align with target criteria.

341,Intermittent Pringle maneuver combined with controlled low Central venous pressure prolongs hepatic hilum occlusion time in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma complicated by post hepatitis B cirrhosis: a randomized controlled trial.,Li J; Chen S; Zhang T; Ma K,"Background: The optimal occlusion and reperfusion time to balance blood loss and ischemia-reperfusion injury to the remnant liver remains unclear. The aim was to explore the clinical impact of prolonging the hepatic hilum occlusion time from 15 to 20 min using the intermittent Pringle maneuver (IPM) combined with controlled low central venous pressure (CLCVP).Methods: A total of 151 patients were included and divided into an experimental group (Group 20,75 cases) and a control group (Group 15,76 cases). In both groups, the hepatic hilum was blocked by the IPM combined with CLCVP to control intraoperative hepatic cross-sectional bleeding. The preoperative, intraoperative and postoperative parameters and safety were compared between the two groups.Results: There were no significant differences between the two groups in the postoperative aminotransferase serum levels (p > 0.05). However, the operation time in Group 20 was significantly lower than that in Group 15 (222.4 ± 87.8 vs. 250.7 ± 94.5 min, p < 0.05).

342,Enlargement of the Spleen Index Is a Predictor of the Occurrence of Esophageal Varices and Hepatocellular Carcinoma after Administering Direct-acting Antiviral Agents.,Furuichi Y; Fujiwara T; Shimojima R; Sato K; Kato H,"Objective Direct-acting antiviral agents (DAAs) can eliminate hepatitis C virus at a high rate, although the long-term incidence of portal hypertension and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) has not yet been elucidated. In this observational study, we clarified the predictors associated with the incidence of esophageal varices (EVs) and HCC after DAAs treatment based on ultrasound findings and blood examinations. Methods A total of 78 patients treated with DAAs were enrolled in this study. The primary endpoint was to identify the predictors associated with EVs and HCC occurrence using univariate and multivariate analyses. Secondary endpoints were to extract the cutoff values for EVs and HCC occurrence and clarify the changes in liver stiffness (LS), spleen stiffness (SS), spleen index (SI), portal venous flow volume (PVF), and blood examination at 12 weeks after the end of DAAs treatment. Results The mean observation period was 1,402±546 days. SI change (SI after DAAs-SI before DAAs) was a predictor of EVs occurrence in multivariate analysis (p=0.045). The treatment history of HCC, albumin value before DAAs, and SI change were predictors of HCC occurrence in multivariate analysis (p=0.002, p=0.032, and p=0.009, respectively). LS, SS, PVF, SI, and liver function significantly improved after DAAs treatment. Conclusion Portal hypertension seems to improve after DAAs treatment over a long period.

Superparamagnetic iron oxide particles (SPIO) are liver-specific contrast agents which enhance lesions in T(2) -weighted images. Iron oxide nano-particle m-PEG-silane (IOP) Injection, a newly developed SPIO, showed promising imaging effects and good safety profile in preclinical studies and in phase I clinical trial. PURPOSE: To evaluate the safety and clinical validity of IOP Injection as MRI contrast agent in diagnosing HCC. STUDY TYPE: Prospective. SUBJECTS: A total of 52 subjects (61.6 ± 11.05 years, 45 males/7 females) with suspected HCC. FIELD STRENGTH/SEQUENCE: 1.5 T, T(1) -weighted in/opposed phase, T(2) *-weighted gradient echo, T(2) -weighted fast spin echo, true fast imaging with steady-state free precession. ASSESSMENT: Adverse effects and clinical monitoring were recorded throughout the 5-day study. Two independent readers (M.G.H. with 30 years of experience, S.P.K. with 26 years of experience) made the diagnosis. The diagnostic performance of IOP-enhanced MRI was evaluated with sensitivity and positive predictive value by comparing to the pathology reports from subsequent hepatic resection. The number of lesions with various sizes and degrees of differentiation detected by IOP-enhanced MRI was assessed. The relative change in signal intensities over time was indirectly measured from acquired images. STATISTICAL TESTS: Sensitivity and positive predictive value were used to evaluate the diagnostic performance of IOP-enhanced MRI. Prevalence-adjusted and bias-adjusted 𝜅 coefficient was used to assess the interreader variability. RESULTS: No serious adverse event related to IOP Injection was found. IOP Injection enhanced the lesion-to-liver contrast ratio in T(2) *-weighted images by 50.1% ± 4.8%. IOP-enhanced MRI detected HCC with 100% sensitivity by subject and 96% sensitivity by lesion. IOP Injection visualized subtle vascular invasion as filling defect within vessels in true fast imaging with steady-state free precession (TrueFISP) images.

The safety of autologous iNKT cell treatment in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) has been verified. This study aimed to investigate its efficacy in advanced HCC after transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) failure. PATIENTS AND METHODS: This open-label, randomized, controlled, trial enrolled 60 patients with unresectable HCC after TACE failure at three centers. Transarterial embolization (TAE) was used instead of TACE to protect iNKT cell function. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive TAE therapy with (TAE-iNKT) or without (TAE) biweekly iNKT cell infusion. The primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS). Secondary endpoints included overall survival (OS), objective response rate (ORR), disease control rate (DCR), quality of life (QoL), peripheral blood cell count, and safety. RESULTS: Fifty-four patients completed the study. Median PFS was significantly higher in TAE-iNKT patients (5.7 months [95% CI, 4.3-7.0 months]) compared with TAE patients (2.7 months [95% CI, 2.3-3.2 months]; hazard ratio 0.32 [95% CI, 0.16-0.63]; P<0.001). Higher ORR and DCR were observed in TAE-iNKT patients (52% and 85%, respectively) compared with TAE patients (11% and 33%; respectively). Five TAE-iNKT patients and 1 TAE patient achieved completed response. The median time to deterioration in QoL was longer in TAE-iNKT patients (9.2 months [95% CI, 6.0-13.3 months]) compared with TAE patients (3.0 months [95% CI, 2.9-3.0 months]). The mean lymphocytes were higher in the TAE-iNKT group than in the TAE group at 8 (1.48 vs 0.95×10(9)/L, P = 0.007) and 12 (1.49 vs 0.89×10(9)/L, P = 0.001) weeks. Grade 3 adverse events occurred in 1 TAE-iNKT patient (4%) and 5 TAE patients (19%). All the other adverse events were grade 1-2.

346,Construction of a novel disulfidptosis-related signature for improving outcomes in hepatocellular carcinoma: Observational study.,Chen X; Liang Q; Zhou Y,"Disulfidptosis is a novel form of metabolic-related regulated cell death (RCD) that is caused by disulfide stress caused by the accumulation of excess cystine in the cell. Targeting disulfide metabolism imbalance is an emerging strategy for the treatment of cancer. However, it is undetermined how disulfidptosis-related genes (DRGs) influence hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Unsupervised clustering analysis was performed on the TCGA-LIHC cohort to identify various phenotypes of disulfidptosis. GSVA was used to measure the activation of characteristic gene sets, while CIBERSORT was employed to estimate the infiltration of immune cells. Disulfidptosis-related signature was generated to quantify the phenotype of disulfidptosis in HCC patients. Next, we examined the disparities among the high and low disulfidptosis score categories by considering clinical characteristics, infiltration of immune cells, functions related to the immune system, sensitivity to chemotherapeutic drugs, and effectiveness of immunotherapy. Two different disulfidptosis phenotypes with different prognoses, clinical traits, biological pathways, and immune cell infiltration were identified. Based on differently expressed genes (DEGs) among 2 disulfidptosis phenotypes, a disulfidptosis-related signature was built. The prognostic value of this signature was then evaluated in the TCGA and GEO datasets. Low disulfidptosis score indicated favorable clinical outcomes, higher levels of immune cell infiltration, lower tumor purity, and enhanced immune responses. Furthermore, we noticed a clear disparity in tumor mutation load and drug responsiveness when comparing the high and low disulfidptosis score categories. Finally, a quantitative nomogram was built with disulfidptosis score and several clinical characteristics. The disulfidptosis-related signature provides new insights into the tumor immune microenvironment and complexity in HCC.

347,Clinical characteristics and predictors of benign portal vein thrombosis in patients with liver cirrhosis: A retrospective single-center study.,Arabpour E; Hatami B; Pasharavavesh L; Rabbani AH; Zarean Shahraki S; Amiri M; Zali MR,"Portal vein thrombosis (PVT) is a common thrombotic complication of cirrhosis. It can lead to variceal bleeding and bowel ischemia and also complicate liver transplantation. Identifying the possible risk factors associated with PVT can aid in identifying patients at high risk, enabling their screening and potentially preventing PVT through the rational use of anticoagulants. This study focuses on examining the clinical characteristics of PVT in cirrhotic patients and identifying the clinical and biochemical factors that are linked to the development of PVT. Consecutive hospitalized cirrhotic patients between 2015 and 2023 were identified through the hospital's computerized medical records based on the Tenth Revision of the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems (ICD-10) coding system and retrospectively analyzed. 928 individuals were included in this study; 783 (84.3%) without PVT and 145 (15.7%) with benign PVT. Hepatitis B virus (HBV) was significantly more common in the PVT group (P-value = .02), while alcohol and primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) were less common in this group (P-value = .01 and .02, respectively). Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) (P-value < .01), ascites (P-value = .01), and spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) (P-value = .02) were more common in the PVT group.

This phase 1, randomized, open-label study in healthy participants assessed the relative bioavailability of a single dose of RCF 225-mg soft gelatin capsules in both fasted and high-fat conditions. Forty-four participants were enrolled to either the fasted (n = 24) or the high-fat fed (n = 20) arm. Noncompartmental pharmacokinetics were evaluated following a single 225-mg oral dose. Administration of RCF with a high-fat meal led to increases in maximum concentration, area under the concentration-time curve (AUC) from time 0 to 24 hours, and AUC from time 0 to infinity fed-to-fasted geometric mean ratios of 102.2%, 114.5%, and 132.9%, respectively. All AUC geometric mean ratios were outside of the 80% to 125% range, suggesting that a high-fat meal can increase the extent of RCF exposure. Time to maximum concentration increased from 1.5 to 1.8 hours in the fasted and high-fat groups, respectively, suggesting slightly delayed absorption.

349,Effect of aerobic exercise training on the fat fraction of the liver in persons with chronic hepatitis B and hepatic steatosis: Trial protocol for a randomized controlled intervention trial- The FitLiver study.,Jespersen S; Plomgaard P; Madsbad S; Hansen AE; Bandholm T; Pedersen BK; Ritz C; Weis N; Krogh-Madsen R,"BACKGROUND: The global prevalence of chronic hepatitis B is more than 300 million people, and in Denmark, 17,000 people are estimated to have chronic hepatitis B. Untreated, chronic hepatitis B can lead to the development of liver cirrhosis and liver cancer. There is no curable therapy. In persons with obesity and chronic hepatitis B infection, the development of hepatic steatosis imposes a double burden on the liver, leading to an increased risk of cirrhosis and liver cancer. In patients without chronic hepatitis B, exercise interventions have shown beneficial effects on hepatic steatosis through improvements in fat fraction of the liver, insulin resistance, fatty acid metabolism, and glucose metabolism, as well as activation of liver-induced regulatory protein secretion (hepatokines) after the exercise intervention. OBJECTIVE: To investigate in persons with chronic hepatitis B and hepatic steatosis: Primary: Whether exercise will decrease the fat fraction of the liver. Secondary: If exercise will affect hepatokine secretion and if it will improve lipid- and glucose metabolism, liver status, markers of inflammation, body composition, and blood pressure. METHODS: A randomized, controlled, clinical intervention trial consisting of 12 weeks of aerobic exercise training or no intervention. Thirty persons with chronic hepatitis B and hepatic steatosis will be randomized 1:1. Before and after the intervention, participants will undergo an MRI scan of the liver, blood sampling, oral glucose tolerance test, fibroscan, VO2(max) test, DXA scan, blood pressure measurements, and optional liver biopsy. Lastly, a hormone infusion test with somatostatin and glucagon to increase the glucagon/insulin ratio for stimulating secretion of circulating hepatokines will be performed. The training program includes three weekly training sessions of 40 min/session over 12 weeks. DISCUSSION: This trial, investigating high-intensity interval training in persons with chronic hepatitis B and hepatic steatosis, is the first exercise intervention trial performed on this group of patients. If exercise reduces hepatic steatosis and induces other beneficial effects of clinical markers in this group of patients, there might be an indication to recommend exercise as part of treatment. Furthermore, the investigation of the effect of exercise on hepatokine secretion will provide more knowledge on the effects of exercise on the liver.

Nofazinlimab is a humanized rat antibody targeting PD-1. A first-in-human study of nofazinlimab conducted in Australia found no dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) and the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) was not reached in the range of 1-10 mg/kg. OBJECTIVE: We evaluated nofazinlimab for multiple advanced malignancies in Chinese patients. PATIENTS AND METHODS: This was a phase 1a/1b, open-label, multicenter, dose-escalation/expansion trial. In phase 1a, patients received an abbreviated dose escalation of nofazinlimab at 60 mg and 200 mg every 3 weeks (Q3W) to determine DLTs and the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D). In phase 1b, patients received the RP2D (monotherapy/combination) in six arms by tumor type; DLTs were evaluated for nofazinlimab plus lenvatinib in the unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (uHCC) arm. Safety (continuously monitored in patients who received nofazinlimab) and efficacy (patients with measurable baseline disease) were assessed. RESULTS: Overall, 107 patients were eligible and received nofazinlimab. In phase 1a, no DLTs were observed; the RP2D was 200mg Q3W. In phase 1b, no DLTs were observed with nofazinlimab plus lenvatinib. The safety profile was consistent with that observed in the first-in-human study (NCT03475251). In phase 1b, 21/88 (23.9%) patients achieved confirmed objective responses, 26 (29.5%) had stable disease, and 9/20 (45.0%) patients with uHCC achieved confirmed objective responses to nofazinlimab plus lenvatinib. CONCLUSIONS: Nofazinlimab was well tolerated in Chinese patients.

We investigated the safety and tolerability of lenvatinib in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients ≥80 years old. METHODS: We retrospectively evaluated 61 HCC patients and divided them into 2 groups: an elderly group (n = 13, ≥80 years old) and a younger group (n = 48, <80 years old). We compared the adverse events (AEs), administration period, dose intensity, objective response, and progression-free survival (PFS) between the two groups. RESULTS: The discontinuation of lenvatinib due to AEs was more frequent in the elderly group (8/13, 61.5%) than in the younger group (10/48, 20.8%) (P = 0.0043). Fatigue and appetite loss accounted for half of the cases discontinued due to AEs in the elderly group. The elderly group had a significantly lower 8-week-delivered dose intensity/body surface area ratio (147.2) and 8-week-relative dose intensity (50.0%) than those in the younger group (267.4, 67%) (P = 0.003, 0.029). The objective response rate was significantly lower in the elderly group (15.4%) than in the younger group (61.5%) (P = 0.021). The PFS in the elderly group tended to be shorter than that in the younger group (P = 0.058, hazard ratio [HR] 1.98). The modified albumin-bilirubin (mALBI) grade (hepatic function) (HR, 2.60; P = 0.01) and objective response (HR, 0.41; P = 0.011) were independently associated with the PFS in the multivariate analysis.

This study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of a clinical decision support system in postembolization syndrome management across nurses and patient outcomes. This study is a randomized controlled trial. We included 40 RNs and 51 hospitalized patients in the study. For nurses in the experimental group, a clinical decision support system and a handbook were provided for 6 weeks, and for nurses in the control group, only a handbook was provided. Notably, the experimental group exhibited statistically significant improvements in patient-centered caring attitude, pain management barrier identification, and comfort care competence after clinical decision support system implementation. Moreover, patients' symptom interference during the experimental period significantly decreased compared with before the intervention. This study offers insights into the potential of clinical decision support system in refining nursing practices and nurturing patient well-being, presenting prospects for advancing patient-centered care and nursing competence. The clinical decision support system contents, encompassing postembolization syndrome risk prediction and care recommendations, should underscore its role in fostering a patient-centered care attitude and bolster nurses' comfort care competence.",False,"Population and study design match, but intervention and outcome do not meet the target criteria.",patients with hepatocellular carcinoma undergoing transarterial chemoembolization,clinical decision support system,handbook only,"patient-centered caring attitude, pain management barrier identification, and comfort care competence",randomized controlled trial,False,Population and study design match but intervention and outcome do not meet criteria,-,intervention should focus on cancer treatment rather than nursing practices,-,outcomes should be related to tumor response or survival,-,,No disagreement between Model A and B,False
353,Renal protection CT protocol using low-dose and low-concentration iodine contrast medium in at-risk patients of HCC and with chronic kidney disease: a randomized controlled non-inferiority trial.,Yoon JH; Park JY; Lee SM; Lee ES; Kim JH; Lee JM,"BACKGROUND: Although efforts have been made to reduce the dose of Contrast Medium (CM) to improve patient safety, there are ongoing concerns regarding its potential effects on image quality and diagnostic performance. Moreover, research is lacking to establish a lower limit for safe and effective CM dose reduction. To determine whether the image quality of contrast-enhanced liver computed tomography (CT) using a reduced amount of iodinated CM was similar to that of standard liver CT. METHODS: We enrolled participants at risk for hepatocellular carcinoma with decreased estimated glomerular filtration rates (< 60 mL/min/1.73m(2)). Participants were randomly assigned to the standard group or the renal protection protocol (RPP) group. In the standard group, images were reconstructed using hybrid iterative reconstruction (iDose), while in the RPP group, low monoenergetic (50-keV) images and deep learning (DL)-based iodine-boosting reconstruction were used. Four radiologists independently assessed image quality and lesion conspicuity. RESULTS: Fifty-two participants were assigned to the standard (n = 25) or RPP (n = 27) groups. The iodine load was significantly lower in the RPP group than in the standard group (301.5 ± 1.71 vs. 524 ± 7.37 mgI/kg, P < 0.001). The 50-keV and DL-based iodine-boosting images from the RPP group exhibited higher image contrast than those from the standard group during arterial (3.60 ± 0.65, 3.75 ± 0.60, and 3.09 ± 0.43, respectively) and portal venous phases (4.01 ± 0.49, 3.86 ± 0.42, and 3.21 ± 0.31, respectively) (P < 0.05 for all). Overall image quality was superior in the RPP group (P < 0.05 for all). No significant difference in lesion conspicuity was observed (P > 0.017). CONCLUSIONS: The reduction in image contrast and overall image quality caused by decreased CM can be restored using either low monoenergetic imaging or DL-based iodine-boosting reconstruction.

354,Respiratory muscle training with electronic devices in the postoperative period of hepatectomy: A randomized study.,Pereira MG; Silva AMO; Galhardo FDM; Almeida BDM; Lopes RL; Boin IFSF,"BACKGROUND: Many studies have been developed with a focus on surgical techniques and drugs, but few that address the importance of rehabilitation in the pre and postoperative period, and the specific benefits for each surgical procedure or type of neoplasm, aiming to minimize respiratory complications in the postoperative period. AIM: To compare the strength of the respiratory muscles in the pre and postoperative periods of hepatectomy by laparotomy and to verify the incidence of postoperative pulmonary complications among the groups studied. METHODS: Prospective, randomized, clinical trial study that compared the inspiratory muscle training group (GTMI) with the control group (CG). After the collection of sociodemographic and clinical data, in both groups, preoperatively, on the first and fifth postoperative days, vital signs and pulmonary mechanics were evaluated and recorded. Albumin and bilirubin values were recorded for the albumin-bilirubin (ALBI) score. After randomization and allocation of participants, those in the CG underwent conventional physical therapy and those in the GTMI underwent conventional physical therapy plus inspiratory muscle, in both groups for five postoperative days. RESULTS: Of 76 subjects met eligibility criteria. The collection of 41 participants was completed: 20 in the CG and 21 in the GTMI. The most frequent diagnosis was 41.5% with liver metastasis, followed by 26.8% with hepatocellular carcinoma. As for respiratory complications in the GTMI, there was no incidence. In the CG, there were three respiratory complications. Patients in the CG classified as ALBI score 3 presented, statistically, a higher energy value compared to patients classified as ALBI score 1 and 2 (P = 0.0187). Respiratory variables, measured preoperatively and on the first postoperative day, had a significant drop in both groups from the preoperative to the first postoperative day (P ≤ 0.0001). When comparing the preoperative period and the fifth postoperative day between the GTMI and the CG, the maximal inspiratory pressure variable in the GTMI was statistically significant (P = 0.0131). CONCLUSION: All respiratory measures showed a reduction in the postoperative period. Respiratory muscle training using the Powerbreathe(®) device increased maximal inspiratory pressure and this may have contributed to a shorter hospital stay and better clinical outcome. reserved.",False,"Population and study design match, but intervention and outcome do not meet the target criteria.",patients undergoing hepatectomy by laparotomy,inspiratory muscle training,conventional physical therapy,strength of the respiratory muscles and incidence of postoperative pulmonary complications,"prospective, randomized, clinical trial",False,Population and study design match but intervention and outcome do not meet criteria,-,intervention should focus on cancer treatment rather than physical therapy,-,outcomes should be related to tumor response or survival,-,,No disagreement between Model A and B,False

We sought to characterise the relationship between radiological patterns of progression and survival post-ICI, also appraising treatment strategies. METHODS: We screened 604 HCC patients treated with ICIs, including only those who experienced PD by data cut-off. We evaluated post-progression survival (PPS) according to the treatment strategy at PD and verified its relationship with radiological patterns of progression: intrahepatic growth (IHG), new intrahepatic lesion (NIH), extrahepatic growth (EHG), new extrahepatic lesion (NEH) and new vascular invasion (nVI). RESULTS: Of 604 patients, 364 (60.3%) experienced PD during observation. Median PPS was 5.3 months (95% CI: 4.4-6.9; 271 events). At the data cut-off, 165 patients (45%) received no post-progression anticancer therapy; 64 patients (17.6%) continued ICI beyond PD. IHG (HR 1.64 [95% CI: 1.21-2.22]; p = .0013) and nVI (HR 2.15 [95% CI: 1.38-3.35]; p = .0007) were associated with shorter PPS. Multivariate models adjusted for progression patterns, treatment line and albumin-bilirubin grade and Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status at PD confirmed receipt of ICI beyond PD with (HR 0.17, 95% CI: 0.09-0.32; p < .0001) or without subsequent TKI (HR 0.39, 95% CI: 0.26-0.58; p < .0001) as predictors of prolonged PPS versus no anticancer therapy.

356,[Pan-cancer analysis of ubiquitin-specific protease 7 and its expression changes in the carcinogenesis of scar ulcer].,Zhang SY; Ruan JJ; Jin DM; Chen N; Xie WG; Ruan QF,"Objective: To explore the biological role and clinical significance of ubiquitin-specific protease 7 (USP7) in the carcinogenesis of scar ulcer. Methods: A retrospective observational study combined with bioinformatics analysis was used. The RNA expression profile data of USP7 in tumor and/or its corresponding paracancular normal tissue were obtained from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database and the Gene Expression Omnibus database, and the RNA sequencing data were transformed by log(2). The variations of USP7 gene were analyzed by cBioPortal database. The USP7 mRNA expression in tumor and adjacent normal tissue in TCGA database were obtained by using the ""Gene_DE"" module in TIMER 2.0 database. The survival rates of patients with high and low USP7 expression in cutaneous melanoma (SKCM), cervical squamous cell carcinoma (CESC), lung squamous cell carcinoma (LUSC), and head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSC) were analyzed using the Gene Expression Profile Interactive Analysis 2 (GEPIA2) database, and the Kaplan-Meier survival curves were drawn. Sangerbox database was used to analyze the correlation of USP7 expression in pan-cancer with microsatellite instability (MSI) or tumor mutation burden (TMB) pan-cancer. Through the ""correlation analysis"" module in the GEPIA2 database, the correlation of USP7 expression in pan-cancer with the expression levels of five DNA mismatch repair genes (MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, PMS2, and EPCAM) and three essential DNA methyltransferases (DNMT)--DNMT1, DNMT3A, and DNMT3B were evaluated. The USP7 expression in CESC, HNSC, LUSC, and SKCM and its correlation with infiltration of immune cells (B cells, CD4(+) T cells, CD8(+) T cells, neutrophils, macrophages, and dendritic cells) were analyzed by the ""Immune-Gene"" module in TIMER 2.0 database. The ""Similar Genes Detection"" module of GEPIA2 database was used to obtain the top 100 protein sets with similar expression patterns to USP7. Intersection analysis was performed between the aforementioned protein sets and the top 50 protein sets that were directly physically bound to USP7 obtained by using the STRING database. Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) and Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment analysis were performed for the two protein sets mentioned above using the DAVID database. The samples of normal skin, hypertrophic scar, scar ulcer, and scar carcinoma with corresponding clinicopathologic features were collected from the Department of Pathology of Tongren Hospital of Wuhan University & Wuhan Third Hospital from October 2018 to October 2022, and the USP7 expression in tissue was detected by immunohistochemical method, with the number of samples of 6. Data were statistically analyzed with Log-rank test, one-way analysis of variance, and Bonferroni test. Results: In pan-cancer, the main gene variations of USP7 were mutation and amplification, and the top 3 tumors with the highest variation frequency (>6%) were bladder urothelial carcinoma, SKCM, and endometrial carcinoma. The main mutation of USP7 gene in pan-cancer was missense mutation. In SKCM with the highest mutation frequency, the main type of mutation was missense mutation in USP7_ICP0_bdg domain. USP7 mRNA expression in breast invasive carcinoma, bile duct carcinoma, colon carcinoma, esophageal carcinoma, HNSC, renal chromophobe cell carcinoma, hepatocellular carcinoma, lung adenocarcinoma, LUSC, prostate carcinoma, and gastric carcinoma was significantly higher than that in corresponding paracancer normal tissue (P<0.05). USP7 mRNA expression in glioblastoma multiforme, renal clear cell carcinoma, renal papillary cell carcinoma, and thyroid carcinoma was significantly lower than that in corresponding paracancular normal tissue (P<0.05). In addition, USP7 mRNA expression in SKCM metastases was much higher than that in primary tumor tissue (P<0.05). Survival curves showed no significant difference in survival rate between patients with high USP7 expression and patients with low USP7 expression in CESC, HNSC, LUSC, and SKCM (Log-rank P>0.05, with hazard ratios of 1.00, 0.99, 1.00, and 1.30, respectively). USP7 expression in colon cancer, colorectal cancer, thymic cancer, and thyroid cancer was negatively correlated with TMB (with Pearson correlation coefficients of -0.26, -0.19, -0.19, and 0.11, respectively, P<0.05). USP7 expression in glioma, CESC, lung adenocarcinoma, mixed renal carcinoma, and LUSC was positively correlated with MSI expression (with Pearson correlation coefficients of 0.22, 0.14, 0.15, 0.08, and 0.14, respectively, P<0.05), and USP7 expression in colon cancer, colorectal cancer, invasive breast cancer, prostate cancer, HNSC, thyroid cancer, and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma were significantly negatively correlated with MSI expression (with Pearson correlation coefficients of -0.31, -0.27, -0.13, -0.19, -0.16, -0.18, and -0.53, respectively, P<0.05). The expression of USP7 in CESC was positively correlated with that of both MSH2 and MSH6 (with Spearman correlation coefficients of 0.51 and 0.44, respectively, P<0.05), and the expression of USP7 in HNSC was positively correlated with the expression of EPCAM, MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, and PMS2 (with Spearman correlation coefficients of 0.39, 0.14, 0.49, 0.54, and 0.41, respectively, P<0.05), and the expression of USP7 in LUSC was positively correlated with the expression of EPCAM, MSH2, MSH6, and PMS2 (with Spearman correlation coefficients of 0.20, 0.36, 0.40, and 0.34, respectively, P<0.05), and the expression of USP7 in SKCM was positively correlated with the expression of EPCAM, MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, and PMS2 (with Spearman correlation coefficients of 0.11, 0.33, 0.42, 0.55, and 0.34, respectively, P<0.05). The expression of USP7 in CESC, HNSC, LUSC, and SKCM was significantly positively correlated with the expression of DNMT1, DNMT3A, and DNMT3B (with Spearman correlation coefficients of 0.42, 0.34, 0.22, 0.45, 0.52, 0.22, 0.36, 0.36, 0.22, 0.38, 0.46, and 0.21, respectively, P<0.05). The expression of USP7 in CESC, HNSC, LUSC, and SKCM was positively correlated with CD4(+) T cell infiltration (with Partial correlation coefficients of 0.14, 0.22, 0.13, and 0.16, respectively, P<0.05). Being similar to the pattern of USP7 expression and ranked among top 100 protein sets, the top 5 proteins were C16orf72, BCLAF1, UBN, GSPT1, ERI2 (with Spearman correlation coefficients of 0.83, 0.74, 0.73, and 0.72, respectively, all P values<0.05). The top 50 protein sets that directly physically bind to USP7 overlapped with the aforementioned protein set by only one protein, thyroid hormone receptor interaction factor 12. KEGG enrichment analysis showed that USP7 related genes were involved in cell cycle, spliceosome, cell senescence, and p53 signal pathway. GO enrichment analysis showed that USP7 related genes were involved in transcriptional regulation, protein ubiquitination, DNA repair, and cytoplasmic pattern recognition receptor signal pathways. Analysis of clinical samples showed that USP7 expression was significantly higher in hypertrophic scars (0.35±0.05), scar ulcers (0.43±0.04), and scar cancers (0.61±0.03) than in normal skin (0.18±0.04), P<0.05.

359,Construction and validation of a SEER-based prognostic nomogram for young and middle-aged males patients with hepatocellular carcinoma.,Yang R; Yu X; Zeng P,"BACKGROUND: Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the most common digestive tumor, and we aimed to develop and validate nomogram models, predicting the overall survival (OS) of young and middle-aged male patients with HCC. METHODS: We extracted eligible data from relevant patients between 2000 and 2017 from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database. In addition, randomly divided all patients into two groups (training and validation = 7:3). The nomogram was established using effective risk factors based on univariate and multivariate analysis. The area under the time-dependent curve, calibration plots, and decision curve analysis (DCA) were used to evaluate the effective performance of the nomogram. The risk stratifications of the nomogram and the AJCC criteria-based tumor stage were compared. RESULTS: 11 variables were selected by univariate and multivariate analysis to establish the nomogram of HCC. The AUC values of 3, 4, and 5 years of the time-ROC curve are 0.858, 0.862 and 0.859 for the training cohort, and 0.858, 0.877 and 0.869 for the validation cohort, respectively, indicating that the nomogram has a good ability of discrimination. The calibration plots showed favorable consistency between the prediction of the nomogram and actual observations in both the training and validation cohorts. In addition, the decision curve DCA showed that the nomogram was clinically useful and had better discriminative ability to recognize patients at high risk than the AJCC criteria-based tumor stage.

The purpose of this study was to investigate the characteristics, treatment patterns and outcomes of sorafenib among HCC patients in South Korea. METHODS: This population-based retrospective, single-arm, observational study used the Korean National Health Insurance database to identify patients with HCC who received sorafenib between July 1, 2008, and December 31, 2014. A total of 9,923 patients were recruited in this study. RESULTS: Among 9,923 patients, 6,669 patients (68.2%) received loco-regional therapy prior to sorafenib, and 1,565 patients (15.8%) received combination therapy with concomitant sorafenib; 2,591 patients (26.1%) received rescue therapy after sorafenib, and transarterial chemoembolization was the most common modality applied in 1,498 patients (15.1%). A total of 3,591 patients underwent rescue therapy after sorafenib, and the median overall survival was 14.5 months compared to 4.6 months in 7,332 patients who received supportive care after sorafenib. The mean duration of sorafenib administration in all patients was 105.7 days; 7,023 patients (70.8%) received an initial dose of 600 to 800 mg. The longest survival was shown in patients who received the recommended dose of 800 mg, subsequently reduced to 400 mg (15.0 months). The second longest survival was demonstrated in patients with a starting dose of 800 mg, followed by a dose reduction to 400-600 mg (9.6 months).

361,Comparing the accuracy of positive and negative indocyanine green staining in guiding laparoscopic anatomical liver resection: protocol for a randomised controlled trial.,Alomari MAM; Wakabayashi T; Colella M; Mishima K; Fujiyama Y; Ababneh E; Wakabayashi G,"INTRODUCTION: Knowledge of the clinical liver anatomy has evolved with advanced imaging modalities and laparoscopic surgery. Therefore, precise anatomical resection knowledge has become the standard treatment for primary and secondary liver cancer. Segmentectomy, a parenchymal-preserving approach, is regarded as an option for anatomical resections in patients with impaired liver. Indocyanine green (ICG) staining is a promising method for understanding the anatomical borders of the liver segments. There are two methods of ICG staining (positive and negative), and the superiority of either approach has not been determined to date. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: This is a prospective randomised controlled superiority clinical trial performed in a single centre tertiary hospital in Japan. A comparison between the accuracy of positive and negative ICG staining in guiding laparoscopic anatomical liver resection is planned in this study. Possible candidates are patients with liver malignant tumours in whom laparoscopic monosegmentectomy or subsegmentectomy is planned. Fifty patients will be prospectively allocated into the following two groups: group A, ICG-negative staining group, and group B, ICG-positive staining group. The optimal dose of ICG for positive staining will be determined during the preparation phase. To assess the ability of the ICG fluorescence guidance in anatomical resection, the primary endpoint is the success rate of ICG staining, which consists of a SOS based on three components: superficial demarcation in the liver surface, visualisation of the parenchymal borders and consistency with the preoperative three-dimensional simulation. The secondary endpoints are the evaluation of short-term surgical outcomes and recurrence-free survival. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The study was approved by Ageo Central General Hospital Clinical Research Ethical Committee (No: 1044) and it carried out following the Declaration of Helsinki (2013 revision). Informed consent will be taken from the patients before participating. The findings will be disseminated through peer-reviewed publications, scientific meetings and conferences.

362,"A Phase I Study to Investigate the Safety, Tolerability and Pharmacokinetics of Napabucasin Combined with Sorafenib in Japanese Patients with Unresectable Hepatocellular Carcinoma.",Okusaka T; Morimoto M; Eguchi Y; Nakamura S; Iino S; Kageyama R,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: For patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), the standard of care for many years has been sorafenib. Preliminary data have suggested that the combination of the NAD(P)H:quinone oxidoreductase 1 bioactivatable agent napabucasin plus sorafenib may improve clinical outcomes in patients with HCC. In this phase I, multicenter, uncontrolled, open-label study, we evaluated napabucasin (480 mg/day) plus sorafenib (800 mg/day) in Japanese patients with unresectable HCC. METHODS: Adults with unresectable HCC and an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0 or 1 were enrolled in a 3 + 3 trial design. The occurrence of dose-limiting toxicities was assessed through 29 days from the start of napabucasin administration. Additional endpoints included safety, pharmacokinetics, and preliminary antitumor efficacy. RESULTS: In the six patients who initiated treatment with napabucasin, no dose-limiting toxicities occurred. The most frequently reported adverse events were diarrhea (83.3%) and palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia syndrome (66.7%), all of which were grade 1 or 2. The pharmacokinetic results for napabucasin were consistent with prior publications. The best overall response (per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors [RECIST] version 1.1) was stable disease in four patients. Using Kaplan-Meier methodology, the 6-month progression-free survival rate was 16.7% per RECIST 1.1 and 20.0% per modified RECIST for HCC. The 12-month overall survival rate was 50.0%. CONCLUSIONS: These findings confirm the viability of napabucasin plus sorafenib treatment, and there were no safety or tolerability concerns in Japanese patients with unresectable HCC.

This study aimed to compare outcomes of ETV versus TDF after liver transplantation (LT) in patients with HBV-related HCC. We performed a multicenter observational study using data from the Korean Organ Transplantation Registry. A total of 845 patients who underwent LT for HBV-related HCC were divided into 2 groups according to oral nucleos(t)ide analogue used for HBV prophylaxis post-LT: ETV group (n = 393) and TDF group (n = 452). HCC recurrence and overall death were compared in naïve and propensity score (PS)-weighted populations, and the likelihood of these outcomes according to the use of ETV or TDF were analyzed with various Cox models. At 1, 3, and 5 years, the ETV and TDF groups had similar HCC recurrence-free survival (90.7%, 85.6%, and 84.1% vs. 90.9%, 84.6%, and 84.2%, respectively, p = 0.98) and overall survival (98.4%, 94.7%, and 93.5% vs. 99.3%, 95.8%, and 94.9%, respectively, p = 0.48). The propensity score-weighted population showed similar results. In Cox models involving covariates adjustment, propensity score-weighting, competing risk regression, and time-dependent covariates adjustment, both groups showed a similar risk of HCC recurrence and overall death. In subgroup analyses stratified according to HCC burden (Milan criteria, Up-to-7 criteria, French alpha-fetoprotein risk score), pretransplantation locoregional therapy, and salvage LT, neither ETV nor TDF was superior.

364,"A multicenter, randomized, parallel-controlled clinical trial protocol to evaluate the safety and efficacy of irreversible electroporation compared with radiofrequency ablation for the treatment of small hepatocellular carcinoma.",Cheng C; Xu M; Pan J; Chen Q; Li K; Xu D; Jing X; Lu Q; Yang H; Zhao Q; Deng Z; Jiang T,"BACKGROUND: At present, the main clinical application of local ablation therapy, such as radiofrequency ablation (RFA), is to heat the tissue to a certain temperature. However, high temperature will cause thermal damage. Irreversible electroporation (IRE) is a novel minimally invasive local ablation technology for tumors. By high-frequency pulse, the tumor cell membrane can be irretrievably perforated, resulting in the destruction of the intracellular environment, which can preserve important structures in the treatment area. However, there are no randomized controlled clinical trials comparing the efficacy of IRE with traditional local ablation in the treatment of liver cancer. AIMS: This study aims to conduct a randomized controlled clinical trial comparing the efficacy of IRE with RFA in the treatment of liver cancer. METHODS: We will conduct a multicenter, randomized, parallel-controlled non-inferiority clinical trial to compare the efficacy and safety of IRE and RFA for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). One hundred and ninety patients with HCC from five academic medical centers will be enrolled. The patients will be randomized into treatment arm (IRE) and control arm (RFA). The primary outcome is the progress -free survival (PFS) and the key secondary outcome is the Overall survival (OS). RESULTS: Forty-eight patients had been recruited from 5 centers, of which, 33 patients (median age, 59.1 years) with 38 tumors had completed the 1-month follow-up and 21 patients have complete the 3-month follow up, with 2.3 months median follow up period. The mean largest tumor diameter is 3.9 cm. No end point was observed for PFS or OS in both groups, and the complete ablation rate was 100% in both groups. The lesions in the IRE group showed obvious shrinkage 1 month after procedure. One major adverse event (AE) was occurred in the control group. CONCLUSION: This is the first randomized controlled clinical trial to compare the clinical effects of IRE and RFA. The preliminary results suggest that both RFA and IRE are effective in the treatment of HCC, which can provide strong evidence for the use of IRE in HCC and provide more options for the treatment of patients with HCC.

METHODS: Seventy HCC patients were enrolled for our study, and they were randomized by simple randomization using computer-generated random numbers into two groups: control group and observation group. Regular follow-up reviews were conducted to assess the efficacy of treatments. The levels of apoptotic factors, the levels of hepatic fibrosis indices, the levels of serum tumor vascular factors and tumor markers, and the occurrence of adverse reactions in the two groups were recorded and compared. RESULTS: Disease control rate, objective response rate, and progression-free survival (PFS) of patients in the observation group were higher in contrast to the control group. After 12 weeks of treatment, lower mRNA expression of c-mesenchymal-epithelial transition factor, telomerase, and Fas Ligand and higher mRNA expression of Fas and Caspase-3 were observed in HCC tissues of the observation group versus the control group (p < 0.05); lower detection values of serum laminin, hyaluronic acid, collage type IV, vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2, and alpha-fetal protein (AFP) were noted in HCC patients of the observation group in comparison to the control group (p < 0.05); there was no difference in the incidence of adverse reactions between the two groups.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Inclusion criteria were liver metastases of extrahepatic malignancies undergoing HDR-BT. 36 patients were prospectively randomized to the medication (N = 18) or control arm (N = 18) and follow-up by hepatobiliary magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was scheduled 6 and 12 weeks after local ablation by HDR-BT. We determined the threshold doses of fRILI by image fusion of MRI with the dosimetry data. RESULTS: 32 patients completed the study schedule. Per-protocol treatment was limited to 8 patients in the medication group and 16 patients in the control group. 22 adverse events of any grade likely or certainly related to PTX were recorded in 12 patients leading to the discontinuation of the study medication in 7 patients and to a dose reduction of PTX in 2 patients. In the per-protocol population, statistical analysis failed to prove a reduction of fRILI 6 and 12 weeks after HDR-BT. The incidence of adverse effects attributed to PTX (70.6%) was well above the data found in the literature for its approved indication. CONCLUSION: The study endpoint was not met mainly attributed to the low statistical power of the small per-protocol cohort.

367,Efficacy of doxorubicin and lipiodol therapy by trans-arterial chemoembolization in hepatocellular carcinoma Egyptian patients and relation to genetic polymorphisms.,Werida RH; Abd El Baset OA; Askar S; El-Mohamdy M; Omran GA; Hagag RS,"BACKGROUND: Genetic polymorphisms play a crucial role in predicting treatment efficacy in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). This study aims to evaluate the response to Transarterial Chemoembolization (TACE) in relation to the genetic polymorphisms of interleukin 28B (IL28B) and angiopoietin-2 (ANGPT2) in HCC patients. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Prospective cohort study conducted on 104 eligible HCC Egyptian patients who underwent TACE using doxorubicin and lipiodol. Genotyping of the IL28B and ANGPT2 genes was performed with laboratory data analysis. RESULTS: At baseline IL28B rs12979860 genotypes C/T, C/C and T/T appeared in 43.9%, 34.6% and 21.5% while ANGPT2 rs55633437 genotypes C/C, C/A and A/A found in 71.03%, 28.04% and 0.93% of patients respectively. After one month of therapy, 51.4% of patients achieved a complete response. There was a significant difference in relation to IL28B rs12979860 genotypes (p = 0.017) whereas ANGPT2 rs55633437 genotypes (p = 0.432) showed no significant difference in patient response after one month of TACE. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates the effectiveness of TACE in Egyptian HCC patients, as evidenced by low recurrence rates. Furthermore, the IL28B rs12979860 (C/T) gene may be associated with the efficacy and prognosis of TACE treatment in HCC Egyptian patients.

368,"Eight versus twelve weeks of sofosbuvir-velpatasvir in treatment-naïve non-cirrhotic patients with chronic hepatitis C virus infection: Study protocol for a multicentric, open labelled, randomized, non-inferiority trial (RESOLVE trial).",Awasthi A; Katiyar H; Rungta S; Deep A; Kumar V; Shalimar; Kumar A; Tiwari P; Goel A,"BACKGROUND: Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is a common cause of liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. Globally, nearly 71 million people have chronic HCV infection, and approximately 399,000 dies annually. In patients without cirrhosis, HCV infection is treated with 12 weeks of sofosbuvir/velpatasvir combination. Results from available small, single-centre observational studies suggest that the sofosbuvir/velpatasvir combination given for 8 weeks may be as effective as the standard 12 weeks of treatment. We propose to compare the treatment response of 12 weeks versus 8 weeks of sofosbuvir/velpatasvir in non-cirrhotic people with chronic HCV infection. METHODS: This multicentric, randomized, open-label, non-inferiority trial will include 880 (2 arms x 440) treatment naïve, viraemic (HCV RNA >10,000 IU/mL), non-cirrhotic adults (age >18 years) with chronic hepatitis C. People who are at high-risk for HCV reinfection such as haemophiliacs, people who inject drugs, those on maintenance hemodialysis or having HIV will be excluded. The presence or absence of cirrhosis will be determined with a combination of history, examination, ultrasound, liver stiffness measured with transient elastography, APRI, FIB-4, and esophagogastroduodenoscopy. Participants will be randomized to receive either 8- or 12-week sofosbuvir/velpatasvir treatment. A blood specimen will be collected before starting the treatment (to determine the HCV genotype), after 4 weeks of treatment (for early virological response), and at 12 weeks after treatment discontinuation for SVR12. DISCUSSION: The study will provide data on the efficacy of 8 weeks of treatment as compared to the standard of care (12 weeks) in non-cirrhotic patients with chronic HCV infection. Treatment for a shorter duration may improve treatment compliance, reduce the cost of treatment, and ease the treatment implementation from a public health perspective.

369,"Neutrophil-to-Lymphocyte Ratio and Early Tumor Shrinkage as Predictive Biomarkers in Unresectable Hepatocellular Carcinoma Patients Treated With Lenvatinib, PD-1 Inhibitors, in Combination With TACE.",Qu S; Wu D; Hu Z,"Purpose: The purpose of this prospective observational study was to investigate the relationship between pretreatment neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) and posttreatment early tumor shrinkage (ETS), and clinical outcomes in patients with unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (uHCC) who received lenvatinib, programmed death-1 inhibitors plus transcatheter arterial chemoembolization. Patients and Methods: A total of 63 uHCC patients were treated with this triple combination. Multivariate analyses to determine the independent factors associated with overall survival (OS) were employed. The link between NLR and clinical results was further analyzed. Furthermore, the predictive value of combining NLR with ETS should be investigated to stratify patients receiving treatment for survival benefits. Results: Progression-free survival and OS were 9.8 and 23.0 months, respectively, with a median follow-up of 20.8 months. On a multivariate analysis of OS, NLR was the only independent prognostic factor. Patients with NLR low (NLR < 3.2) had longer progression-free survival (19.3 vs 7.3 months, P < 0.001) and OS (28.9 vs 16.9 months, P < 0.001), higher objective response rate (86.7% vs 39.4%, P < 0.001), and a higher chance of achieving ETS ≥ 10% (ETS high) (73.3% vs 21.1%, P < 0.001) compared with patients with NLR high (NLR ≥ 3.2). The Spearman correlation analysis also showed the strong consistency between NLR and ETS (R(2) = 0.6751). In the subgroup analysis, greater OS benefit was found in the NLR low/ETS high group than the NLR high/ETS low group (χ(2) = 31.258, P < 0.001), while there was no survival difference for patients in the NLR low/ETS low group compared with in the NLR high/ETS high group (χ(2) = 0.046, P = 0.830).

Small ubiquitin-like modifier (SUMO) proteins and NF-κB family play major roles in various cellular processes. The current study aims to determine the expression profile of SUMO and NF-κB genes in HCC tumors and investigate their association with the clinical outcome of HCC. The expression of 5 genes - SUMO1, SUMO2, SUMO3, NF-κB p65, and NF-κB p50 - was quantified in tumor and adjacent non-tumor tissues of 58 HBV-related HCC patients by real-time quantitative PCR and was analyzed for the possible association with clinical parameters of HCC. The expression of SUMO2 was significantly higher in HCC tumor tissues compared to the adjacent non-tumor tissues (P = .01), while no significant difference in SUMO1, SUMO3, NF-κB p65, and NF-κB p50 expression was observed between HCC tumor and non-tumor tissues (P > .05).

371,Comparison of computed tomography response criteria after chemoembolization of hepatic carcinoma in dogs.,Rogatko C; Weisse C; Schwarz T; Berent A; Diniz M,"The objective of this study was to evaluate unidimensional (mm), bidimensional (mm(2)), or tridimensional (mL) computed tomography (CT) tumor measurements for ability to discriminate changes in lesion size and predict survival in dogs with nonresectable hepatic carcinoma treated with drug-eluting bead transarterial-chemoembolization (DEB-TACE) and to compare CT response via Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors 1.1 (mm), World Health Organization (mm(2)), ellipsoid and spherical volume (mL), and percent necrosis, for their ability to differentiate treatment responders. This was a prospective, single-arm clinical trial. DEB-TACE was performed to varying levels of blood flow stasis in 16 client-owned dogs with nonresectable hepatic carcinoma. Computed tomography imaging responses were assessed and compared to median survival time. Results revealed that initial, follow-up, or changes in unidimensional, bidimensional, or tridimensional tumor measurements were not associated with survival. Larger bidimensional and tridimensional tumor measurements/body weight on initial and follow-up CT were significantly associated with a shorter median survival time [bidimensional (P = 0.04, 0.016) and tridimensional (P = 0.025, 0.015), respectively].

372,Hepatobiliary-Phase Hypointense Nodules Without Arterial-Phase Hyperenhancement: Developing a Risk Stratification for Hypervascular Transformation Based on a Real-World Observational Cohort Study.,Li N; Wang Y; Yang L; Yang C; Zeng M,"PURPOSE: To develop a risk stratification based on MRI features to predict hypervascular transformation for hepatobiliary-phase (HBP) hypointense nodules without arterial-phase hyperenhancement (APHE). MATERIALS AND METHODS: This retrospective observational cohort study included 55 HBP hypointense nodules without APHE in 35 patients with chronic liver disease, cirrhosis, or current hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) who underwent gadoxetic acid-enhanced MRI. The hypervascular transformation during the follow-up MRI(s) was the primary endpoint analyzed for the nodules. Univariable and multivariable Cox proportional hazard regression analyses were performed to identify risk features predicting transformation and assess their predictive value. RESULTS: Among the 55 nodules, 27 developed hypervascular transformation, while 28 did not. Diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) hyperintensity (hazard ratio [HR], 4.98; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.60, 15.54; p = 0.006) and portal venous phase (PVP) hypointensity (HR, 4.08; 95% CI: 1.43, 11.64; p = 0.009) were associated with hypervascular transformation. DWI hyperintensity and PVP hypointensity had 44.4% (95% CI: 26.0%, 64.4%) and 81.9% (95% CI: 61.3%, 93.0%) sensitivity, while their specificity was 78.2% (95% CI: 64.6%, 87.8%) and 67.9 (95% CI: 47.6%, 83.4%), respectively. The specificity of the combination of two features was 100% (95% CI: 85.0%, 100%). The hypervascular transformation rates for nodules with both, either and neither of the risk MRI findings were 100% (10/10), 60.9% (14/23), and 13.6% (3/22), respectively; the median intervals for transformation were 312 (range: 73-838), 409 (range: 50-1643) and 555 (range: 423-968) days, respectively. CONCLUSION: The combination of DWI hyperintensity and PVP hypointensity may be used as a high-risk indicator for the hypervascular transformation of HBP hypointense nodules without APHE; nodules without either feature may be treated as low-risk nodules and could adopt an extended interval follow-up schedule.",False,"Population matches, but intervention, comparison, outcome, and study design do not meet target criteria.","35 patients with chronic liver disease, cirrhosis, or current HCC",MRI features for risk stratification,not specified,predict hypervascular transformation,retrospective observational cohort study,False,"Population matches but intervention, comparison, outcome, and study design do not meet target criteria",-,-,-,-,-,,No disagreement between Model A and B,False
373,HCCs lacking arterial phase hyperenhancement (APHE) on contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) - a diagnostic challenge. Findings from the prospective multicenter DEGUM CEUS HCC trial.,Strobel D; Agaimy A; Jesper D; Zundler S; Schellhaas B,"OBJECTIVES: Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) upon contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) typically shows arterial phase hyperenhancement (APHE), followed by late (> 60 seconds) and mild contrast washout (WO). Although APHE is considered as the hallmark of HCC, it can be absent in some HCCs. Thus, we explored which sonomorphological and histopathological features of HCC are associated with a lack of APHE upon CEUS. METHODS: Focal liver lesions in high-risk patients for HCC were assessed with CEUS following a standardized protocol in a prospective multi-center real-life setting. CEUS patterns in HCC were assessed, and tumour and patient characteristics were compared for HCCs with and without APHE. RESULTS: 316 patients with HCC were recruited (cirrhosis, 76.9%). APHE occurred in 271/316 HCCs (85.8%). A lack of APHE was associated with portal vein thrombosis, tumour infiltration of the liver vessels (p<0.001), larger size, multilocularity, and higher depth location upon ultrasound (p<0.01). Histological grading did not differ between HCCs with and without APHE (p=0.39). Histopathological features of HCCs without APHE included cirrhotic stromal reaction, marked tumour cell steatosis and absence of the typical surrounding dilated sinusoidal vascular channels. CONCLUSION: Correlation with histopathological findings support the fact that HCCs with a lack of APHE in CEUS are a heterogeneous group. The examiner has to be aware that particularly HCCs with portal vein thrombosis or macro-invasion of the liver vessels may lack APHE.",False,"Population matches, but intervention, comparison, outcome, and study design do not meet target criteria.",316 patients with HCC,contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS),not specified,sonomorphological and histopathological features associated with lack of APHE,prospective multi-center real-life setting,False,"Population matches but intervention, comparison, outcome, and study design do not meet target criteria",-,-,-,-,-,,No disagreement between Model A and B,False
374,[Clinical Features and Prognosis of Multiple Myeloma Patients with Secondary Primary Malignancies].,Li LL; Li ML; Zhang Y; Liu Y; Liu YF; Jiang ZX; Chen SQ; Wang SJ; Wang C,"OBJECTIVE: To explore the clinical characteristics and prognosis of multiple myeloma(MM) patients with secondary primary malignancies. METHODS: The clinical data of newly diagnosed MM patients admitted to the First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University from January 2011 to December 2019 were retrospectively analyzed. The patients with secondary primary malignancies were retrieved, and their clinical features and prognosis were evaluated. RESULTS: A total of 1 935 patients with newly diagnosed MM were admitted in this period, with a median age of 62 (18-94) years old, of which 1 049 cases were hospitalized twice or more. There were eleven cases with secondary primary malignancies (the incidence rate was 1.05%), including three cases of hematological malignancies (2 cases of acute myelomonocytic leukemia and 1 case of acute promyelocytic leukemia) and eight cases of solid tumors (2 cases of lung adenocarcinoma, and 1 case each of endometrial cancer, esophageal squamous cell carcinoma, primary liver cancer, bladder cancer, cervical squamous cell carcinoma, and meningioma). The median age of onset was 57 years old. The median time between diagnosis of secondary primary malignancies and diagnosis of MM was 39.4 months. There were seven cases with primary or secondary plasma cell leukemia, the incidence rate was 0.67%, and the median age of onset was 52 years old. Compared with the randomized control group, the β2-microglobulin level in the secondary primary malignancies group was lower (P=0.028), and more patients were in stage I/II of ISS (P=0.029). Among the 11 patients with secondary primary malignancies, one survived, ten died, and the median survival time was 40 months. The median survival time of MM patients after the secondary primary malignancies was only seven months. All seven patients with primary or secondary plasma cell leukemia died, with a median survival time of 14 months. The median overall survival time of MM patients with secondary primary malignancies was longer than that of the patients with plasma cell leukemia (P=0.027). CONCLUSION: The incidence rate of MM with secondary primary malignancies is 1.05%.

375,Etiology and Outcomes of Patients with Extreme Hyperbilirubinemia in Korea: A Retrospective Cohort Study.,Kwak JY; Jeon H; Kim SJ; Han JH; Cha RR; Lee SS,"BACKGROUND/AIM: Extreme hyperbilirubinemia is occasionally observed in intensive care unit (ICU) and non-ICU settings. This study examined the etiologies of extreme hyperbilirubinemia (bilirubin level ≥12 mg/dL) and the factors associated with the 30-day mortality. METHODS: This retrospective observational cohort study identified 439 patients with extreme hyperbilirubinemia at the Gyeongsang National University Changwon Hospital between 2016 and 2020. The patients were classified into three groups and 11 diseases according to their etiology. The risk factors associated with 30-day mortality at the baseline were investigated using the Cox proportional hazards model. RESULTS: Of 439 patients with extreme hyperbilirubinemia, 287, 78, and 74 were in the liver cirrhosis/malignancy group, the ischemic injury group, and the benign hepatobiliary-pancreatic etiological group, respectively, with corresponding 30-day mortality rates of 42.9%, 76.9%, and 17.6%. The most common disease leading to hyperbilirubinemia was a pancreatobiliary malignancy (28.7%), followed by liver cirrhosis (17.3%), hepatocellular carcinoma (10.9%), and liver metastases (8.4%). The etiologies of hyperbilirubinemia, obstructive jaundice, infection, albumin level, creatinine level, and prothrombin time-international normalized ratio were independently associated with the 30-day mortality.

We assessed the clinical characteristics and surgical outcomes of non-B non-C-HCC, versus hepatitis B (HBV-HCC) and hepatitis C (HCV-HCC). METHODS: Etiologies, fibrosis stages, and survival outcomes were analyzed of 789 consecutive patients who underwent surgery from 1990 to 2020 (HBV-HCC, n = 149; HCV-HCC, n = 424; non-B non-C-HCC, n = 216). RESULTS: The incidence of hypertension and diabetes mellitus was significantly higher in patients with NON-B NON-C-HCC than in those with HBV-HCC and HCV-HCC. Significantly more advanced tumor stages were observed in patients with non-B non-C-HCC; however, better liver function and lower fibrosis stages were observed. Patients with non-B non-C-HCC had significantly worse 5-year overall survival than patients with HBV-HCC; overall survival was comparable between patients with non-B non-C-HCC and HCV-HCC. Patients with HCV-HCC had significantly worse 5-year recurrence-free survival than patients with HBV-HCC and non-B non-C-HCC. In patients with non-B non-C-HCC, overall survival was comparable among three periods (1990-2000, 2001-2010, and 2011-2020) despite significant improvement in patients with HBV-HCC and HCV-HCC.

We aimed to determine risk factors associated with the development of liver-related events (LREs) after SVR, focusing on the utility of non-invasive markers. Methods: An observational, retrospective study that included patients with advanced chronic liver disease (ACLD) caused by hepatitis C virus (HCV), who achieved SVR with DAAs between 2014 and 2017. Patients were followed-up until December 2020. LREs were defined as the development of portal hypertension decompensation and the occurrence of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Serological markers of fibrosis were calculated before treatment and one and two years after SVR. Results: The study included 321 patients, with a median follow-up of 48 months. LREs occurred in 13.7% of patients (10% portal hypertension decompensation and 3.7% HCC). Child-Pugh [HR 4.13 (CI 95% 1.74; 9.81)], baseline FIB-4 [HR 1.12 (CI 95% 1.03; 1.21)], FIB-4 one year post-SVR [HR 1.31 (CI 95% 1.15; 1.48)] and FIB-4 two years post-SVR [HR 1.42 (CI 95% 1.23; 1.64)] were associated with portal hypertension decompensation. Older age, genotype 3, diabetes mellitus and FIB-4 before and after SVR were associated with the development of HCC. FIB-4 cut-off values one and two years post-SVR to predict portal hypertension decompensation were 2.03 and 2.21, respectively, and to predict HCC were 2.42 and 2.70, respectively.

We used linked health administrative data to estimate all-cause and cause-specific mortality among individuals who had an alcohol-related hospital inpatient or emergency department presentation. DESIGN: Observational study using data from the Data linkage Alcohol Cohort Study (DACS), a state-wide retrospective cohort of individuals with an alcohol-related hospital inpatient or emergency department presentation. SETTING: Hospital inpatient or emergency department presentation in New South Wales, Australia, between 2005 and 2014. PARTICIPANTS: Participants comprised 188 770 individuals aged 12 and above, 66% males, median age 39 years at index presentation. MEASUREMENTS: All-cause mortality was estimated up to 2015 and cause-specific mortality (by those attributable to alcohol and by specific cause of death groups) up to 2013 due to data availability. Age-specific and age-sex-specific crude mortality rates (CMRs) were estimated, and standardized mortality ratios (SMRs) were calculated using sex and age-specific deaths rates from the NSW population. FINDINGS: There were 188 770 individuals in the cohort (1 079 249 person-years of observation); 27 855 deaths were recorded (14.8% of the cohort), with a CMR of 25.8 [95% confidence interval (CI) = 25.5, 26.1] per 1000 person-years and SMR of 6.2 (95% CI = 5.4, 7.2). Mortality in the cohort was consistently higher than the general population in all adult age groups and in both sexes. The greatest excess mortality was from mental and behavioural disorders due to alcohol use (SMR = 46.7, 95% CI = 41.4, 52.7), liver cirrhosis (SMR = 39.0, 95% CI = 35.5, 42.9), viral hepatitis (SMR = 29.4, 95% CI = 24.6, 35.2), pancreatic diseases (SMR = 23.8, 95% CI = 17.9, 31.5) and liver cancer (SMR = 18.3, 95% CI = 14.8, 22.5). There were distinct differences between the sexes in causes of excess mortality (all causes fully attributable to alcohol female versus male risk ratio = 2.5 (95% CI = 2.0, 3.1). CONCLUSIONS: In New South Wales, Australia, people who came in contact with an emergency department or hospital for an alcohol-related presentation between 2005 and 2014 were at higher risk of mortality than the general New South Wales population during the same period.

However, difficulty in handling US transducer-guided technology is a key limitation to its wider use. The aim of the study was to explore the effect of guide marks on the side of US transducer on the success rate of US transducer-guided radial artery puncture. METHODS: In this parallel-group trial, 127 patients undergoing elective liver cancer resection and splenectomy under general anesthesia were randomly allocated to the traditional group or the Intervention group. The traditional group used the conventional US transducer-guided radial artery puncture technology, while the Intervention group used the US transducer-guided radial artery puncture technology with the guide marks on the side of the US transducer probe. The primary observation index was success rate of radial artery cannulation at the first attempt; the secondary observation indices were failure rate of cannulation, location time, and total time for successful cannulation. RESULTS: The successful rate of cannulation in the Intervention group (59 out of 63, 93.6%) was greater than that in the traditional group (50 out of 64, 78.1%, p = 0.01). The posterior wall puncture rate in the Intervention group was lower than that in the traditional group (11.1% vs 32.8%, p = 0.005). The location time in the Intervention group was longer than that in the traditional group (20.1 ± 3.8 vs 16.6 ± 4.0 s, p < .001), while the total cannulation time was significantly shorter (20.7 ± 4.3 vs 32.4 ± 7.4 s, p < 0.001).

INCB062079, an oral, selective, FGFR4 inhibitor, inhibits growth in FGF19/FGFR4-driven liver cancer models. METHODS: This was a two-part, phase I study (NCT03144661) in previously treated patients with advanced solid tumors. The primary objective was to determine safety, tolerability, and maximum tolerated dose (MTD), while secondary objectives included pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics (plasma FGF19; bile acid salts/7α-hydroxy-4-cholesten-3-one [C4] levels), and preliminary efficacy. In Part 1, patients received INCB062079 starting at 10 mg once daily, with 3 + 3 dose escalation. Part 2 (dose expansion) was not conducted because of study termination. RESULTS: Twenty-three patients were treated (hepatobiliary, n = 11; ovarian, n = 9; other, n = 3). Among six patients receiving 15 mg twice daily, two patients had dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs; grade 3 diarrhea, grade 3 transaminitis). Both had high pretreatment C4 concentrations, prompting a protocol amendment requiring pretreatment C4 concentrations < 40.9 ng/mL and concomitant prophylactic bile acid sequestrant treatment. No additional DLTs were reported at 10 and 15 mg twice daily; higher doses were not assessed. The most common toxicity was diarrhea (60.9%). INCB062079 exposure was dose-proportional; FGF19 and bile acid/C4 concentrations increased with exposure. One partial response was achieved (15 mg twice daily; ovarian cancer; FGF/FGFR status unknown; duration of response, 7.5 months); two patients had stable disease. CONCLUSIONS: With C4 cut-off and prophylactic bile acid sequestrant implementation, INCB062079 demonstrated a manageable safety profile and evidence of target inhibition.

Patients with CHB may need to be adherent to nucleoside analogue (NA) for a long period of time to prevent complications. This study aims to investigate the safety, efficacy and patient experience of a virtual monitoring clinic (VMC) in monitoring stable patients taking NA for CHB. METHODS: Patients on NA and regular follow-up were randomised to either VMC alternating with doctors' clinic visit or to a control group in which they continued standard follow-up by doctors. Therapy adherence was measured by medication possession ratio (MPR) for NA therapy, incidence of virological breakthrough and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) development at two years of follow-up. Patient acceptance was measured on a Likert scale of 1-10. RESULTS: A total 192 patients completed follow-up: 94 and 98 patients in the VMC and control groups, respectively. Mean age was 60.6 ± 10.8 years, with 95.3% Chinese ethnicity and 64.1% males. Age, gender, race, educational, employment and financial status were similar in both groups. Upon study completion, the majority of patients - 76 (80.9%) in VMC group and 74 (75.5%) in control group - had MPR ≥0.8; 88.8% were satisfied and rated VMC better than a traditional follow-up clinic with doctors only. More than 85% of patients rated ≥8/10 on the Likert scale for VMC, and preferred VMC over traditional clinic visits. Clinical outcomes observed were HCC development in one (1.1%) in the VMC group and four (4.1%) in the control group (p = 0.369). Two (2.1%) and one (1.0%) virological breakthroughs were observed in the VMC and control groups, respectively (p = 0.615). No incidence of HCC or abnormal blood tests were missed in the VMC arm.

383,Evaluating the burden of illness of metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis in a large managed care population: The ETHEREAL Study.,Charlton M; Tonnu-Mihara I; Teng CC; Zhou Z; Asefaha F; Luthra R; Articolo A; Hoovler A; Uzoigwe C,"BACKGROUND: Metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH; formerly nonalcoholic steatohepatitis) is the inflammatory form of metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (formerly nonalcoholic fatty liver disease). MASH is a progressive disease associated with increased risk for many hepatic and extra-hepatic complications such as cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma, the requirement for liver transplantation, and cardiovascular (CV)-related and kidney-related complications. It is important to understand the clinical and economic burden of MASH. OBJECTIVES: To assess and compare the clinical and economic burdens of MASH in adults with the non-MASH population in a real-world setting. METHODS: This observational, retrospective study used the Healthcare Integrated Research Database (HIRD), which contains health care claims data for commercially insured and Medicare Advantage health plan members across the United States. All-cause, CV-related, and liver-related medical costs and health care resource utilization were evaluated in patients with at least 2 diagnoses of MASH during the patient identification period (October 1, 2016, to April 30, 2022) and compared with a non-MASH cohort 1:1 matched on age, Quan Charlson Comorbidity Index, region of residence, and health plan type and length of enrollment. Generalized linear regression with negative binomial and γ distribution models were used to compare health care resource utilization and medical costs, respectively, while controlling for confounders. Covariate-adjusted all-cause, CV-related, and liver-related hospitalization rate ratios and medical cost ratios were assessed and compared for the MASH and matched non-MASH cohorts. RESULTS: A total of 18,549 patients with MASH were compared with 18,549 matched patients in the non-MASH cohort. After adjusting for covariates, MASH was associated with significantly higher rates of hospitalization and higher medical costs compared with the non-MASH cohort.

384,Suspected focal nodular hyperplasia in male adults: 10-year experience from a large liver centre.,Corallo C; Bell J; Laverty A; Mohsin M; Prasad R; Albazaz R,"PURPOSE: Focal nodular hyperplasia (FNH) is commonly found in females of reproductive age. In males, the diagnosis is made more cautiously due to its lower incidence and higher incidence of hepatocellular carcinoma, which can have overlapping imaging features. Follow-up or biopsy is sometimes required. This retrospective study aims to assess management of suspected FNH in male adult patients at our institution over a 10-year period. METHODS: Male adults (≥ 18 years) suspected of having FNH from January 2010-June 2020 were identified using a departmental radiology information system search. Data was collected from radiology reports and patient pathway manager. RESULTS: Of 342 patients with suspected FNH, 62 were male (18.1%; F:M of 4.5:1). We only included patients investigated and followed up by MRI, total of 57 patients. Median age was 40 years (range 18-74 years). Background liver disease present in 21/57 (36.8%), majority with hepatic steatosis. Average number of lesions per patient 1.7. 22/57 (38.6%) had at least one MRI follow-up using liver-specific contrast with 7 lesions demonstrating variation in size (range growth: -3.27 mm/year to + 4 mm/year). In 7 cases, MRI was not definitive; 6 required biopsy and 1 resection. Only 2/7 demonstrated malignancy. Of the total 57 patients, 6 have deceased and none due to a misdiagnosed or mismanaged hepatic lesion. CONCLUSION: FNH is relatively uncommon in males, however, our data suggests that lesions with typical MRI characteristics do not require follow-up and diagnosis can be made confidently, similar to females. Any atypical features should prompt a biopsy.

385,Cost-effectiveness of radiofrequency ablation versus percutaneous ethanol injection for early hepatocellular carcinoma in a resource-poor setting: a randomized trial.,Mariotti GC; Felga GEG; Garcia RG; Falsarella PM; Schmid BP; Malheiros DT; Baroni RH; Serpa Neto A,"OBJECTIVE: This study assessed the cost-effectiveness of radiofrequency ablation compared with percutaneous ethanol injection in patients with early hepatocellular carcinoma in relation to the objective response rate and costs related to the procedure. METHODS: This was a prospective single-center randomized trial. The primary outcome was cost-effectiveness. Secondary outcomes were the complete response rate according to the modified response evaluation criteria in solid tumors 60 days after randomization and the complication rate within 180 60 days. RESULTS: Fifty patients were placed into the following groups: percutaneous ethanol injection (n=23) and radiofrequency ablation (n=27). Fifty-four nodules were randomized (mean follow-up: 205.37 days). The estimated mean hospital cost was US$ 1854.11 and US$ 2770.96 for the Radiofrequency Ablation and Percutaneous Ethanol Injection Groups, respectively. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was US$ -2674.59, which is advantageous for radiofrequency ablation. After 60 d, 28 of 29 nodules in the Radiofrequency Ablation Group achieved complete response versus 12 of 22 in the Percutaneous Ethanol Injection Group (RD, 42.01 [95%CI= 20.55-63.24]; p<0.001). Only four early complications were observed among patients treated by percutaneous ethanol injection (p<0.05). Late complications occurred in two and one patient(s) in the Radiofrequency Ablation and Percutaneous Ethanol Injection Groups (p>0.05), respectively.

386,Comparison Between the Efficacy of Spinal Cord Stimulation and of Endovascular Revascularization in the Treatment of Diabetic Foot Ulcers: A Retrospective Observational Study.,Xu X; Fu Y; Bao M,"OBJECTIVE: We aimed to compare the effects of spinal cord stimulation (SCS) with those of endovascular revascularization on the treatment of diabetic foot ulcers. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 104 patients with diabetic foot ulcers who met the inclusion criteria were retrospectively analyzed and classified to the SCS treatment group (n = 46) and endovascular revascularization treatment group (n = 46). The quality-of-life scores (Quality of Life Scale for Patients with Liver Cancer v2.0), visual pain analog scale score, lower limb skin temperature, lower limb arterial ultrasound results, and lower extremity electromyography results were analyzed to compare the efficacy of the two treatments for diabetic foot ulcers in the two groups before surgery and six months after surgery. RESULTS: A total of 92 patients (men: 73.9%, mean age: 66.51 ± 11.67 years) completed the six-month postoperative follow-up period. The patients in the SCS treatment group had a higher quality-of-life score (25.54% vs 13.77%, p < 0.05), a larger reduction in pain scores (69.18% vs 37.21%, p < 0.05), and a larger reduction in foot temperature (18.56% vs 7.24%, p < 0.05) than those of the endovascular revascularization treatment group at six months after surgery. The degree of vasodilation in the lower limbs on color Doppler arterial ultrasound and the nerve conduction velocity were higher in the SCS treatment group than in the endovascular revascularization treatment group at six months after surgery (p < 0.05).

387,Comparative Real Life Egyptian Experience of the Combination of Sofosbuvir Plus Daclatasvir or Simeprevir for 12 Weeks in Naïve Cirrhotic Patients Infected with HCV Genotype 4.,Ahmed S; Hassan E; Gomaa A; Esamat G; Ramadan A; Ahmed M; Elsayed A; A Wahsh E,"BACKGROUND: Chronic infection with HCV is progressive worldwide health problem and the core reason for liver cirrhosis, portal hypertension, or hepatocellular carcinoma. HCV-G4 represents the most common threat to transplantation of the liver in Egypt. New interferon-free regimens have been started consuming direct-acting antiviral oral tablets for HCV cure. OBJECTIVES: In the current study, comparing the safety and efficacy of DAAs combination regimens including sofosbuvir with daclatasvir or sofosbuvir with simeprevir plus ribavirin for naïve cirrhotic Egyptian patients infected with HCV-G4 was our main goal. METHODS: We recruited 150 naïve cirrhotic HCV patients from the Tropical patients' clinic at Fayoum General Hospital. They were classified randomly into two groups, group one (n=75 patients) were administrated Sofosbuvir plus simeprevir (400 mg and 150 mg once daily respectively ) for twelve weeks, and group two (n=75 patients) were administrated Sofosbuvir plus Daclatasvir (400 mg and 60 mg once daily respectively) with ribavirin (1-1.2 gm daily weight-based) for twelve weeks. Clinical follow-up, laboratory investigations, and viral PCR were measured to detect treatment efficacy, safety, and any adverse events. RESULTS: Sustained virological response rates (SVR12) were 92%and 90.7% in the first and second groups, respectively. The major unfavorable events were fatigue, arthralgia, and weight loss without statistically meaningful differences between study groups. However, anemia and headache were significantly widespread in the second group (P=0.0161 and 0.0495, respectively). We observed four patients with photosensitivity in group I and not observed in the second group.

Renal function deterioration significantly impacts the survival rates of liver recipients, and serum uric acid (SUA) is associated with both acute and chronic renal function disorders. Thus, our study aimed to assess the relationship and predictive value of preoperative SUA level and postoperative acute kidney injury (AKI) in living donor liver transplantation (LDLT). METHODS: We conducted a prospective observational study on 87 patients undergoing LDLT. Blood samples were collected immediately before LDLT, and renal function status was followed up for 3 consecutive days postoperatively. RESULTS: Low SUA levels (cutoff value 4.15 mg/dL) were associated with a high risk of early posttransplantation AKI. The area under the curve was 0.73 (sensitivity, 79.2%; specificity, 59.4%). Although not statistically significant, there were no deaths in the non-AKI group but two in the early AKI group secondary to liver graft dysfunction in addition to early AKI within the first month after LDLT. CONCLUSION: AKI after liver transplantation may lead to a deterioration of patient status and increased mortality rates.

389,Prognosis of Patients with Chronic Hepatitis C Genotype 1b Infection Treated Using Daclatasvir/Asunaprevir after Sustained Virologic Response: A 6-Year Multicenter Prospective Observational Study.,Yoon JH; Kim SE; Cho SH; Kim GA; Park Y; Park JW; Kang SH; Lee YS; Kim JH,"Aim and Objectives: Direct-acting antiviral (DAA) therapy can cure chronic hepatitis C (CHC), and daclatasvir (DCV)/asunaprevir (ASV) was the first interferon-free DAA therapy introduced in Korea. Patients who achieve sustained virologic response (SVR) after DAA treatment are expected to have good prognoses. Therefore, in this study, we aimed to investigate the prognosis of these patients. Materials and Methods: This multicenter prospective observational study included patients with CHC who achieved SVR after DCV/ASV treatment. The primary endpoint was hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) occurrence, which was reviewed annually. Results: We included 302 patients (median follow-up duration: 38 [16.5-60.0] months; median age: 58 [49-67] years) in the study. Cirrhosis was observed in 103 patients (34.1%), and the median Child-Pugh score was 5.0. HCC occurred in 16 patients (5.3%) within six years post-SVR; these patients were older and had higher cirrhosis prevalence, alpha-fetoprotein levels, and fibrosis-4 index scores than did those without HCC development. Cox proportional hazards analysis revealed that age > 71 years (p = 0.005) and cirrhosis (p = 0.035) were significant risk factors for HCC occurrence. Conclusions: Although the prognoses of patients who achieved SVR with DCV/ASV therapy were generally good, the risk for HCC was present, especially in older patients and in those with cirrhosis.

METHODS: This two-arm retrospective observational study included patients with HCCs >3 cm who underwent either combination therapy (29 patients) or MWA monotherapy (35 patients) between 2014 and 2020. The treatment outcomes related to primary treatment efficacy, local tumor progression (LTP), tumor control rate, and overall survival were compared between each cohort. RESULTS: The technical success and primary efficacy were 96.56% and 100.00% in the combination therapy cohort, and 91.42% and 100.00% in the MWA cohort, respectively, over a mean follow-up period of 27.6 months. The 1- and 3-year rates of LTP-free survival were 78.57% and 69.56% in the combination therapy cohort, vs. 72.45% and 35.44% in the MWA cohort, respectively (P = 0.001). The overall progression-free survival was longer in the combination therapy cohort compared with the MWA cohort (median: 56.0 vs. 13.0 months; P = 0.017).

METHODS: Six healthy Chinese male volunteers were administered a single oral dose of 300 mg donafenib containing 120 µCi of [14 C]-donafenib. The study involved collecting and analyzing plasma, urine, and feces samples to determine the recovery and distribution of total radioactivity, identify metabolites, and assess the metabolic pathways of donafenib. RESULTS: The mean recovery of total radioactivity was 97.31% of the administered dose. Six metabolites were identified, with the parent drug being the major radioactive component in plasma (67.52% of total radioactivity) and feces (83.17% of the dose). The N-oxidation metabolite (M2) was prominent in plasma. Donafenib was predominantly excreted via feces, indicating liver metabolism, with minimal renal excretion. The metabolic pathways of donafenib were similar to those of sorafenib, but the metabolite profiles differed significantly. Notably, the amide hydrolysis metabolite M6, present in sorafenib, was absent in donafenib. CONCLUSION: Donafenib is primarily metabolized in the liver and excreted through feces, with a metabolic profile that differs from sorafenib due to the deuterium isotope effect. These differences in metabolic characteristics may contribute to donafenib's improved safety and efficacy as a treatment for advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). part of Springer Nature.",False,"Population does not match, and there is no comparison or outcome related to survival or response rate.",healthy Chinese male volunteers,donafenib,not specified,"absorption, metabolism, and excretion of donafenib",not specified,False,Population does not match and there is no comparison or outcome related to survival or response rate,-,-,-,-,-,,No disagreement between Model A and B,False

However, their broad adoption requires ease of use and demonstration of real-world clinical utility/impact. ORIGAMA (MO42720) is an interventional, open-label, multicountry platform study investigating the clinical utility of DPM tools and specific treatments. ORIGAMA will begin with two cohorts that aim to assess the impact of the atezolizumab-specific Roche DPM Module (hosted on the Kaiku Health DPM platform (Helsinki, Finland)) on health outcomes and healthcare resource usage, and its feasibility to support at-home treatment administration, in participants receiving systemic anticancer treatment. Other digital health solutions may be added to future cohorts. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: In Cohort A, participants with metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), extensive-stage SCLC or Child Pugh A unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma will be randomised to a locally approved anticancer regimen containing intravenous atezolizumab (TECENTRIQ, F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd/Genentech) and local standard-of-care support, with/without the Roche DPM Module. Cohort B will assess the feasibility of the Roche DPM Module in supporting administration of three cycles of subcutaneous atezolizumab (1875 mg; Day 1 of each 21-day cycle) in the hospital, followed by 13 cycles at home by a healthcare professional (ie, flexible care), in participants with programmed cell-death ligand 1-positive, early-stage NSCLC.

393,Utility of guided FNAC and cell block preparation from liver and gall bladder masses: Learning experience from a tertiary care center.,Bohara S; Shukla P; Shah S; Chaturvedi R; Singh K,"INTRODUCTION: Ultrasound- and CT-guided fine needle aspiration cytology (FNAC) increases the accessibility of intra-abdominal masses to the liver and gall bladder with the advantages of low cost and high diagnostic yield. Cell block technique has been known for further increasing the diagnostic accuracy. AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: We aimed to study the effectiveness of FNAC and the cell block method in cytological diagnosis of liver and gall bladder masses. We also followed a step-wise approach to increase the success rate. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A 2-year observational study was done from July 2020 to June 2022. Total 80 guided (CT and ultrasound) aspirations were done from space occupying/mass lesions in the liver [74 (92.5%)] and gall bladder [6 (7.5%)], out of which cell blocks by the plasma thrombin method were prepared in 12 cases (15%). The on-site radiological details were noted, and rapid on-site evaluation was done in 65 cases (81.25%). The prepared cytology slides were stained with Papanicolaou, H and E and May-Grunwald Giemsa (MGG) stain. The cytological diagnosis was noted, and the uses and limitations (if any) were observed in each case. A step-wise structured questionnaire format was developed to assist the reporting pathologist so as not to miss out on important diagnostic observations, if present. RESULTS: FNAC in 71 cases (88.7%) gave a conclusive diagnosis. The maximum number of cases were of adenocarcinoma [38 (51.3%)] from the liver followed by hepatocellular carcinoma in 10 cases (13.5%). In gall bladder masses, all 6 cases (100%) were positive for malignancy, out of which 4 cases (66.7%) could be characterized as adenocarcinoma. The cell block preparation was helpful in reaching the diagnosis as well as typing the malignancy in 10 cases (83.3%). The chief limitation observed on conventional cytology smears was inadequate cellularity, which caused inconclusive diagnosis in 9 cases (11.25%). The reporting questionnaire was helpful chiefly in terms of time-efficient reporting in 34 cases (42.5%), increasing the ease and confidence in 69 cases (86.25%) and the advantage of reproducibility of data in all cases (100%) according to the case-by-case evaluation by the reporting pathologists.

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the technical efficacy and complication of the novel electrode system for patients who have small HCC. METHODS: In this prospective, single-center clinical trial, ten participants with 14 small (≤ 2 cm, BCLC 0-A) HCCs referred for RFA were enrolled. A novel electrode system consisting of two ICAEs and one MPN with a thermometer and side holes was used for RFA. The RF energy was delivered using a multichannel RF system combining bipolar and switching monopolar modes. Technical success, efficacy, and complications were evaluated on immediate and one-month follow-up CT. RESULTS: Technical success was achieved in 92.9% (13/14) of tumors. One participant withdrew consent after RFA, and technical efficacy was achieved in 91.7% (11/12) of tumors. None showed thermal injury to nontarget organs. All patients were discharged the day after RFA without major complications. The active electrode lengths were adjusted in 60% (6/10) of patients during the procedure to tailor the ablation zone (83.3%, n = 5) or treat two tumors with different sizes (16.7%, n = 1). MPN was capable of continuous temperature monitoring during all ablations (100%, 14/14).

METHODS: This open-label, multicenter phase 2 study (clinicaltrials.gov identifier NCT03973112) was conducted in China and consisted of four treatment groups: group A (serplulimab 3 mg/kg plus HLX04 5 mg/kg, subsequent-line), group B (serplulimab 3 mg/kg plus HLX04 10 mg/kg, subsequent-line), group C (serplulimab 3 mg/kg, subsequent-line) and group D (serplulimab 3 mg/kg plus HLX04 10 mg/kg, first-line). Group D was the only group in which participants received the study treatment in the first-line setting. The primary endpoint was safety. RESULTS: Following previous report on groups A and B, results of group D are herein presented. As of February 7, 2023, 61 patients were enrolled and were followed up for a median of 25.5 months. Grade ≥ 3 treatment-emergent adverse events were reported by 29 (47.5%) patients. One patient died from adverse events that were considered related to study treatment. Among the patients with at least one post-baseline tumor assessment (n = 58), the objective response rate was 29.3% (95% CI: 18.1-42.7) as assessed by an independent radiological review committee (IRRC) per RECIST v1.1. IRRC-assessed median progression-free survival was 7.3 months (95% CI: 2.8-11.0), and median overall survival was 20.4 months (95% CI: 15.0-NE), respectively.

This study compared the outcomes of LMWA and trans-arterial chemoembolization (TACE) for early non-resectable patients with HCC, taking percutaneous radiofrequency ablation (PRFA) as the reference treatment. METHODS: A retrospective multicenter observational study was conducted, enrolling non-transplantable, non-resectable patients who had early HCC treated with LMWA (n = 658) from Padua and Milan centers, and with PRFA (n = 844), and TACE (n = 425) from the ITA.LI.CA multicenter database. The matching-adjusted indirect comparison (MAIC) method was used to obtain weighted LMWA and TACE populations similar to the reference PRFA population. RESULTS: Laparoscopic ablation showed an excellent safety profile, and MAIC-weighted early postoperative deaths were comparable among the groups. The MAIC-weighted overall survival was similar between the LMWA (1-, 3-, and 5 year survival of 91.0 %, 67.9 %, 47.0 %, respectively) and PRFA (1-, 3- and 5 year survivals of 90.0 %, 64.7 %, 46.6 %, respectively) groups (p = 0.678) and significantly better for the LMWA group than for the TACE group (1-, 3- and 5 year survivals of 84.7 %, 48.8 %, 33.6 %, respectively) (p < 0.001). Weighted multivariate overall survival analysis and competing risk/subgroup analyses confirmed the non-inferiority of LMWA to PRFA and its superiority to TACE. The LMWA- and PRFA-treated patients had a significantly lower risk of HCC-related death (p = 0.004) than the TACE-treated patients (p = 0.001). Conversely, the groups did not differ significantly in terms of non-HCC-related deaths.

399,Effect of Medical Accessibility on Long-Term Survival in Liver Transplantation.,Jo SJ; Rhu J; Kim J; Choi GS; Joh JW,"BACKGROUND Medical accessibility is important in liver transplantation (LT) because of the risk of infections associated with the use of immunosuppressants and complications that require continuous treatment, such as biliary stenosis. However, the effect of medical accessibility on LT success rates has yet to be scrutinized. The aim of this retrospective observational study is to determine whether medical accessibility affects LT outcomes. MATERIAL AND METHODS We enrolled patients who had undergone LT at Samsung Medical Center between January 2017 and December 2021. The level of medical access was divided into 2 categories (difficult and easy) based on a cutoff of a 120-min commute on public transportation to access LT. Baseline characteristics were calibrated with propensity score matching. The outcomes (overall survival and graft survival) and severity of emergency center visits according to medical accessibility were also investigated. RESULTS A total of 486 patients was included in this study. The median time to reach the hospital by public transportation was 135 min. Sex, Child-Pugh classification, Model for End-stage Liver Disease score, presence of hepatocellular carcinoma, and donor type were calibrated with propensity score matching, and each group consisted of 186 patients. The overall survival (88.3% vs 86.2%, P=0.67, 5-year) and graft survival (98.6% vs 95.4%, P=0.086, 5-year) showed no significant differences between the difficult-to-access and easy-to-access groups. While severity of emergency center visits differed between the difficult group (27.6%) and the easy group (15.5%), the difference was not statistically significant.

There exists guidance for clinical trial protocols and reporting of completed trials in the Standard Protocol Items: Recommendations for Interventional Trials (SPIRIT) 2013 and CONsolidated Standards Of Reporting Randomised Trials (CONSORT) 2010 statements. However, neither the original statements nor their extensions adequately cover the specific features of EPDF trials. The DEFINE (DosE-FIndiNg Extensions) study aims to enhance transparency, completeness, reproducibility and interpretation of EPDF trial protocols (SPIRIT-DEFINE) and their reports once completed (CONSORT-DEFINE), across all disease areas, building on the original SPIRIT 2013 and CONSORT 2010 statements. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: A methodological review of published EPDF trials will be conducted to identify features and deficiencies in reporting and inform the initial generation of the candidate items. The early draft checklists will be enriched through a review of published and grey literature, real-world examples analysis, citation and reference searches and consultation with international experts, including regulators and journal editors. Development of CONSORT-DEFINE commenced in March 2021, followed by SPIRIT-DEFINE from January 2022. A modified Delphi process, involving worldwide, multidisciplinary and cross-sector key stakeholders, will be run to refine the checklists. An international consensus meeting in autumn 2022 will finalise the list of items to be included in both guidance extensions.

Bintrafusp alfa, a first-in-class bifunctional fusion protein composed of the extracellular domain of TGF-βRII (a TGF-β ""trap"") fused to a human IgG1 monoclonal antibody blocking programmed cell death 1 ligand 1, was evaluated in patients with advanced HCC. APPROACH AND RESULTS: In this global, open-label, phase I study (NCT02517398), patients with programmed cell death 1 ligand 1-unselected HCC who failed or were intolerant to ≥1 line of sorafenib received bintrafusp alfa 1200 mg every 2 weeks in a dose-escalation (n = 38) or dose-expansion (n = 68) cohort until confirmed progression, unacceptable toxicity, or trial withdrawal. The primary endpoint was the best overall response per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors version 1.1 by an independent review committee. Secondary endpoints included investigator-assessed best overall response, safety, and pharmacokinetics. Median follow-up times (range) were 41.4 (39.8-44.2) and 38.6 (33.5-39.7) months in the dose-escalation and dose-expansion cohorts, respectively. The objective response rate was below the prespecified 20% objective response rate threshold set to evaluate the efficacy of bintrafusp alfa in both cohorts (10.5% and 8.8%, respectively). Median overall survival and progression-free survival, respectively, were 13.8 and 1.5 months in the dose-escalation cohort and 13.5 and 1.4 months in the dose-expansion cohort.

This study aimed to evaluate the performance of scores in predicting 90-day mortality in patients with cirrhosis and PVT. METHODS: Post hoc analysis was performed in two prospective cohorts (NCT02457637 and NCT03641872). The correlation between the MELD/MELD-Na score and 90-day liver transplantation (LT)-free mortality was investigated in patients with cirrhosis with and without PVT. RESULTS: In this study, 2826 patients with cirrhosis were included, and 255 (9.02%) had PVT. The cumulative incidence of 90-day LT-free mortality did not significantly differ between patients with and without PVT (log-rank P = 0.0854). MELD [area under the receiver operating curve (AUROC), 0.649 vs. 0.842; P = 0.0036] and MELD-Na scores (AUROC, 0.691 vs. 0.851; P = 0.0108) were compared in patients with and without PVT, regarding the prediction of 90-day LT-free mortality. In MELD < 15 and MELD-Na < 20 subgroups, patients with PVT had a higher 90-day LT-free mortality than those without PVT (7.91% vs. 2.64%, log-rank P = 0.0011; 7.14% vs. 3.43%, log-rank P = 0.0223), whereas in MELD ≥ 15 and MELD-Na ≥ 20 subgroups, no significant difference was observed between patients with and without PVT. CONCLUSIONS: The performance of MELD and MELD-Na scores in predicting 90-day LT-free mortality of patients with cirrhosis was compromised by PVT. MELD < 15 or MELD-Na < 20 may underestimate the 90-day LT-free mortality in patients with PVT.

403,The link between high factor VIII to protein C ratio values and poor liver function after major hepatectomy.,Duque P; Perez-Peña JM; Alarcon-Perez L; Olmedilla L; Varela JA; Pascual C; Rodriguez-Huerta AM; Asencio JM; Lopez-Baena JÁ; Garutti I,"Our goal was to assess the coagulation profile in the immediate postoperative time after major liver surgery and its association with the liver function. Our hypothesis is that a decreased synthesis of the coagulation factor levels reflects an impaired liver synthesis following hepatic resection and will be associated with poor outcomes. This is a prospective, observational study recruiting consecutive patients scheduled for major liver resection in a tertiary hospital. Coagulation profile was assessed by conventional assays, viscoelastic assays and coagulation factor levels preoperatively and, on postoperative days 1, 2 and 6. Factor VIII to protein C (FVIII/PC) ratio has been used as a surrogate marker of hemostatic imbalance. Liver function was measured with conventional and indocyanine green (ICG) clearance tests, which were obtained preoperatively and on postoperative days 1 and 2. Sixty patients were recruited and 51 were included in the study. There is a clear increase in FVIII/PC ratio after surgery, which was significantly associated with low liver function, being more pronounced beyond postoperative day 2 and in patients with poorer liver function ( P < 0.001). High FVIII/PC ratio values were significantly associated with higher postoperative morbidity, prolonged ICU and hospital stay and less survival ( P < 0.05). High FVIII/PC ratio on postoperative day 2 was found to be predictor of posthepatectomy liver failure (PHLF; area under the ROC curve = 0.8129).

Documentation of HHC in health care workers (HCWs) is limited during odd hours and nighttime. The objective of the study was to determine diurnal variation in HHC in different categories of health care workers in tertiary care hospital in North India. METHODS: A prospective, observational study was conducted in 3 COVID-19 intensive care units (ICUs) with closed-circuit television (CCTV) cameras. Dedicated infection control nurses monitored HHC among various HCWs (doctors, nursing staff, technicians, hospital and sanitary attendants) during day and nighttime, in 20-minute durations. The difference in HHC by-professional category and for each WHO moment was assessed using χ² test and P value. RESULTS: A total of 705 opportunities were observed over a period of 7 days, with overall compliance of 53%. Day and nighttime compliance was recorded to be 60.7% and 42.1%, respectively (P < .001). HCC was highest amongst resident doctors with little diurnal variation. However, nurses and housekeeping staff exhibited significant diurnal variation. The compliance at ""after"" moments was much higher than ""before"" moments in all professional categories. CONCLUSION: There was a significant decrease in compliance during nighttime, amongst all HCWs, with maximum variation exhibited by nursing staff. The present study underlines the importance of monitoring HHC at odd hours, to elicit a more accurate picture round the clock. Health care facilities monitoring compliance only during the daytime may substantially overestimate HHC. Epidemiology, Inc. Published by Elsevier Inc.

Our aim was to investigate whether this quality improvement can be observed also during liver transarterial chemoembolization (TACE). MATERIALS AND METHODS: We retrospectively compared the CNR and IQ parameters of DSA and DVA images from 25 patients (65% male, mean ± SD age: 67.5 ± 11.2 years) underwent TACE intervention at our institute. CNR was calculated on 50 images. IQ of every image set was evaluated by 5 experts using 4-grade Likert scales. Both single image evaluation and paired image comparison were performed in a blinded and randomized manner. The diagnostic value was evaluated based on the possibility to identify lesions and feeding arteries. RESULTS: DVA provided significantly higher CNR (mean CNR(DVA)/CNR(DSA) was 1.33). DVA images received significantly higher individual Likert score (mean ± SEM 3.34 ± 0,08 vs. 2.89 ± 0.11, Wilcoxon signed-rank p < 0.001) and proved to be superior also in paired comparisons (median comparison score 1.60 [IQR:2.40], one sample Wilcoxon p < 0.001 compared to equal quality level). DSA could not detect lesion and feeding artery in 28 and 36% of cases, and allowed clear detection only in 22% and 16%, respectively. In contrast, DVA failed only in 8 and 18% and clearly revealed lesions and feeding arteries in 32 and 26%, respectively. CONCLUSION: In our study, DVA provided higher quality images and better diagnostic insight than DSA; therefore, DVA could represent a useful tool in liver TACE interventions.

METHODS: In this retrospective study, 224 consecutive patients with clinicopathologically confirmed IMCC were enrolled. Patients whose data were collected from February 2010 to December 2020 were randomly divided into the training (131 patients) and internal validation (51 patients) datasets. The data from January 2021 to November 2021 (42 patients) were allocated to the time-independent validation dataset. Univariate and multivariate forward logistic regression analyses were used to identify preoperative MRI features that were significantly related to MVI, which were then used to develop the nomogram. We used the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) and calibration curve to evaluate the performance of the nomogram. RESULTS: Interobserver agreement of MRI qualitative features was good to excellent, with κ values of 0.613-0.882. Multivariate analyses indicated that the following variables were independent predictors of MVI: multiple tumours (odds ratio [OR]) = 4.819, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.562-14.864, P = 0.006), ill-defined margin (OR = 6.922, 95% CI 2.883-16.633, P < 0.001), and carbohydrate antigen 19-9 (CA 19-9) > 37 U/ml (OR = 2.890, 95% CI 1.211-6.897, P = 0.017). A nomogram incorporating these factors was established using well-fitted calibration curves. The nomogram showed good diagnostic efficacy for MVI, with AUC values of 0.838, 0.819, and 0.874 for the training, internal validation, and time-independent validation datasets, respectively. CONCLUSION: A nomogram constructed using independent factors, namely the presence of multiple tumours, ill-defined margins, and CA 19-9 > 37 U/ml could predict the presence of MVI. This can facilitate personalised therapeutic strategy and clinical management in patients with IMCC.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients were affected by hepatocellularcarcinoma (HCC) in intermediate stage or previous stages unfit for ablation and/or surgery; they were randomized into two groups according to arterial access site (Group F: right femoral access in standard position; Group R: radial access with left arm abduced 90°). Overall fluoroscopy time was recorded. Eight thermoluminescence dosimeters were positioned immediately before each procedure to monitor radiation doses. Technical success was intended as complete HCC nodules lipiodolization at final plain cone-beam CT. RESULTS: Group F included 23 patients, while group R 19. Mean fluoroscopy time was lower in group F but difference was not statistically significant (p-value > 0.05). In terms of operators radiations exposure, no significant differences were found (p-value > 0.05). Technical success was obtained in 81.5% in group F and 84.8% in group R, without significant differences (p-value > 0.05). Patients discomfort was significantly (p-value < 0.05) higher in group F. Concerning minor complications, no statistical differences were appreciated (p-value > 0.05); no major complications occurred.

METHODS: Observational study performed between March and June 2020 in solid organ transplant recipients admitted with an established diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection who received lopinavir/ritonavir (≥2 doses). Once lopinavir/ritonavir therapy was initiated, calcineurin inhibitor treatment was temporarily switched to prednisone monotherapy (15-20 mg/d) to avoid drug-drug interactions and toxicity. After lopinavir/ritonavir treatment completion, immunosuppressive treatment was restarted with reduced doses of prednisone-tacrolimus (target minimum blood concentration -C(0)- approximately 5 ng/mL). Patients were observed for 3 months to confirm the absence of rejection. RESULTS: The median time from discontinuation of tacrolimus to initiation of lopinavir/ritonavir was 14 hours (interquartile range [IQR], 12-15) and from discontinuation of lopinavir/ritonavir to resumption of tacrolimus 58 hours (IQR, 47-81). The duration of lopinavir/ritonavir treatment was 7 days (IQR, 5-7). Nine of the 21 (42.8%) patients on tacrolimus treatment had C(0) above the cutoff point after lopinavir/ritonavir initiation, despite having been substituted with prednisone before lopinavir/ritonavir initiation. Three patients had very high concentrations (>40 ng/mL) and developed toxicity. No episodes of acute rejection were diagnosed. DISCUSSION: We did not observe toxicity in patients for whom tacrolimus was discontinued 24 hours before starting lopinavir/ritonavir and reintroduced at half dose 48 to 72 hours after lopinavir/ritonavir discontinuation. Prednisone monotherapy during lopinavir/ritonavir therapy was safe with no episodes of acute rejection. Experience with lopinavir/ritonavir may be applicable to the use of nirmatrelvir/ritonavir, but larger multicentre studies are needed to confirm these findings.",False,"Does not specify hepatocellular carcinoma patients, immunotherapy or targeted therapy, standard therapy or placebo, survival or response rate, or randomized controlled trial design.",solid organ transplant recipients with SARS-CoV-2 infection,prednisone monotherapy,not specified,"drug-drug interactions, efficacy, safety",observational study,False,The study focuses on drug-drug interactions and prednisone monotherapy in transplant recipients with SARS-CoV-2 infection.

Here, we report the preliminary efficacy, safety, pharmacokinetics, and immunogenicity of iparomlimab in patients with advanced solid tumors. METHODS: In this open-label, phase 1c study, patients with advanced or metastatic solid tumors, either failed or had no standard therapies available, were enrolled and received intravenous iparomlimab at 3 mg/kg once every 3 weeks. The primary efficacy endpoint was the objective response rate (ORR) assessed by the investigator per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) version 1.1. RESULTS: Between July 20, 2020, and September 6, 2021, 71 patients were enrolled and received at least one dose of iparomlimab. The ORR was 9.9% (7/71) and disease control rate was 36.6% (26/71). Median duration of response of all responders was 10.7 months [95% confidence interval (CI), 1.4-not estimable]. Additionally, the median time to progression, progression-free survival, and overall survival were 1.4 months (95% CI, 1.4-2.8), 1.4 months (95% CI, 1.4-2.7), and 9.7 months (95% CI, 7.2-15.3), respectively. A total of 52 (73.2%) patients experienced treatment-related adverse events (TRAEs) (grade ≥ 3, 19.7%). The most common TRAE (≥ 10%) was anemia (18.3%). A total of 20 (28.2%) experienced immune-related adverse events (grade ≥ 3, 7.0%). TRAEs leading to discontinuation of study drug occurred in 4 (5.6%) patients, including immune-mediated myocarditis (2 patients), Guillain-Barré syndrome (1 patient), and diarrhea (1 patient). CONCLUSIONS: Iparomlimab showed preliminary clinical activity and had a manageable safety profile in patients with advanced solid tumors. These results support further investigation of iparomlimab as monotherapy or in combination therapy in advanced solid tumors. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov identifier, NCT05801094.

411,Validation of the R3-AFP model for risk prediction of HCC recurrence after liver transplantation in the SiLVER randomized clinical trial.,Piñero F; Lai Q; Costentin C; Degroote H; Schnitzbauer A; Geissler EK; Duvoux C,"Explant-based models for assessing HCC recurrence after liver transplantation serve as the gold standard, guiding post-liver transplantation screening and immunosuppression adjustment. Incorporating alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) levels into these models, such as the novel R3-AFP score, has notably enhanced risk stratification. However, validation of these models in high-evidence data is mandatory. Therefore, the aim of the present research was to validate the R3-AFP score in a randomized clinical trial. We analyzed the intention-to-treat population from the 2-arm SiLVER trial (NCT00355862), comparing calcineurin-based ([calcineurin inhibitors]-Group A) versus mammalian target of rapamycin inhibitors-based (sirolimus-Group B) immunosuppression for post-liver transplantation HCC recurrence. Competing risk analysis estimated sub-hazard ratios, with testing of discriminant function and calibration. Overall, 508 patients from the intention-to-treat analysis were included (Group A, n = 256; Group B, n = 252). The R3-AFP score distribution was as follows: 42.6% low-risk (n = 216), 35.7% intermediate-risk (n = 181), 19.5% high-risk (n = 99), and 2.2% very-high-risk (n = 11) groups. The R3-AFP score effectively stratified HCC recurrence risk, with increasing risk for each stratum. Calibration of the R3-AFP model significantly outperformed other explant-based models (Milan, Up-to-7, and RETREAT), whereas discrimination power (0.75 [95% CI: 0.69; 0.81]) surpassed these models, except for the RETREAT model ( p = 0.49). Subgroup analysis showed lower discrimination power in the mammalian target of rapamycin group versus the calcineurin inhibitors group ( p = 0.048). In conclusion, the R3-AFP score accurately predicted HCC recurrence using high-quality evidence-based data, exhibiting reduced performance under mammalian target of rapamycin immunosuppression. This highlights the need for further research to evaluate surveillance schedules and adjuvant regimens.",False,"Population matches, intervention and comparison are related to immunosuppression not directly to immunotherapy or targeted therapy for HCC, outcome does not directly match (survival or response rate not specified)",patients post-liver transplantation for HCC,calcineurin-based vs. mammalian target of rapamycin inhibitors-based immunosuppression,calcineurin inhibitors vs. sirolimus,HCC recurrence risk stratification,randomized clinical trial,False,Population matches post-liver transplantation for HCC but intervention and comparison focus on immunosuppression rather than immunotherapy or targeted therapy.
