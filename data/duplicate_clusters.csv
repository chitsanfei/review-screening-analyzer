0,0,0,"Optimizing the Safe Washout Period for Liver Transplantation Following Immune Checkpoint Inhibitors with Atezolizumab, Nivolumab, or Pembrolizumab","Kuo, FC; Chen, CY; Lin, NC; Liu, CS; Hsia, CY; Loong, CC",10.1016/j.transproceed.2023.03.064,"Background. Using immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) as a downstaging therapy for liver transplantation (LT) has improved outcomes for patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). However, this therapy carries a risk of post-transplant graft rejection. The washout (WO) period between the last ICI dose and LT seems critical in preventing postoperative rejection. This study aimed to optimize the WO period by balancing tumor burden suppression and rejec-tion prevention using ICIs before LT.Methods. We reviewed published case reports or series from March 2020 to December 2022 regarding LT for HCC after downstaging or bridge therapy with ICIs and included 4 of our cases. Most patients received atezolizumab, nivolumab, or pembrolizumab; these ICIs shared a half-life of around 28 days. Therefore, we excluded cases without definite WO period data and those using non-atezolizumab/nivolumab/pembrolizumab ICIs and ultimately enrolled 22 patients for analysis. We compared their clinical outcomes and estimated the rejection-free survival for every 0.5 half-life interval.Results. Most study subjects received nivolumab (n = 25). Six patients had severe rejections (nivolumab group, n = 5) and needed rescue management. Of the 6 cases, 1 patient died after rejection, and 2 underwent re-transplantation. The median WO period in these 6 patients was 22 days (IQR: 9-35 days). In addition, we found that a 1.5 half-life (42 days) was the shortest safe WO period associated with significant rejection-free survival (P = .005).Conclusions. Our results showed that 42 days was the safest WO period before LT for HCC after ICI with atezolizumab, nivolumab, or pembrolizumab."

This review provides an updated overview of the current evidence on ICI therapy before and after LT, discussing the associated pitfalls and remaining challenges. A particular focus is placed on the interactions between ICIs and immunosuppressive drugs, in order to identify predictive factors of good response, as well as critical aspects that should guide future research on the topic.Abstract Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remains the leading oncological indication for liver transplantation (LT), with evolving and broadened inclusion criteria. Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) gained a central role in systemic HCC treatment and showed potential in the peri-transplant setting as downstaging/bridging therapy before LT or as a treatment for HCC recurrence following LT. However, the antagonistic mechanisms of action between ICIs and immunosuppressive drugs pose significant challenges, particularly regarding the risk of acute rejection (AR). This review analyzes the main signaling pathways targeted by ICI therapies and summarizes current studies on ICI therapy before and after LT. The literature on this topic is limited and highly heterogeneous, precluding definitive evidence-based conclusions. The use of ICIs before LT appears promising, provided that a sufficient wash-out period is implemented. In contrast, the results of post-LT ICI therapy do not support its wide clinical application due to high AR rates and overall poor response to treatment. In the future, modern graft preservation techniques might support the selection of good ICI responders, but data from high-level studies are urgently needed."

Although transarterial chemoembolization has been used as the standard treatment for intermediate-stage HCC, it has recently included molecular-targeted drugs and ICIs. As intermediate-stage HCC encompasses a wide variety of HCCs, the appropriate regimen to be used and the order of drug administration, including the use of anti-angiogenic inhibitors, remain controversial. This review discusses treatment strategies for intermediate-stage HCC considering the background of progress in the treatment of advanced-stage HCC. Transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) has been standard treatment for intermediate-stage hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). However, all intermediate-stage HCC patients did not benefit from TACE treatment because intermediate-stage HCC encompasses a wide variety of HCCs. Owing to remarkable progress in systemic therapy, including molecular-targeted therapy for advanced-stage HCC, the standard treatment of HCC has recently shifted to systemic therapy. However, it remains controversial as to which treatment should be initially performed for intermediate-stage HCC. In addition, although curative treatment can be considered when the tumor shrinks, the timing of conversion therapy remains uncertain.

Liver transplantation (LT) is the best therapy for most patients with non-metastatic HCC. In recent years, the management of patients with HCC has considerably changed, thanks to the improvement of molecular biology knowledge and the introduction of immunotherapy. To date, systemic therapy is authorized in the Western world only in patients with advanced HCC. However, this therapy could not only stabilize the tumour disease or improve survival but could display excellent response and lead to downstaging of the tumour that finally permits LT. There are increasing reports of patients that have performed LT after pretreatment with immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs). However, due to the intrinsic mechanism of ICIs, graft rejection might be favoured. In addition, chronic adverse effects affecting other organs may also appear after the end of therapy. This review aims to evaluate the readiness and outcomes of LT in patients with advanced HCC who have previously undergone treatment with ICIs. It seeks to identify the challenges, risks, and benefits associated with this conversion therapy. The integration of ICIs into the treatment paradigm for advanced HCC necessitates a nuanced approach to LT. While early evidence supports the feasibility of LT following ICIs therapy, there is an urgent need for standardized guidelines and more extensive longitudinal studies to optimize patient selection, timing, and post-transplant management."

10,6,6,Immune checkpoint inhibitors in liver transplant: a case series,"Rudolph, M; Shah, SA; Quillin, R; Lemon, K; Olowokure, O; Latif, T; Sohal, D",10.21037/jgo-22-922,"Background: Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) in the setting of liver transplant (LT) pose a risk of rejection and hold unclear benefit in both the neoadjuvant (pre-transplant) and post-transplant salvage setting. In the pre-transplant setting, neoadjuvant ICIs may serve as a bridge to LT by downstaging disease burden to fit within transplant criteria. Outcomes in this setting include patients who had successful transplants without complications to patients who suffered severe complications, including fatal hepatic necrosis and graft failure requiring re-transplant. Some authors suggest having a period of three months between checkpoint inhibition and transplant may help mitigate adverse effects. In the post-LT setting, there are few treatment options if there is a recurrence of disease, which forces treatment teams to reconsider checkpoint inhibitors. Again, a longer period of time between transplant and checkpoint inhibition may reduce risk of rejection. Case reports of patients treated with ICIs post-transplant utilized either nivolumab or pembrolizumab. As combination atezolizumab/bevacizumab is a relatively new treatment option for unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), there are only three reported cases using this combination in the post-LT setting. While there were no cases of rejection, all three cases had progression of disease. As immunotherapy joins transplantation as a mainstay of treatment for HCC, it remains unclear how to best navigate when the treatment course involves both immune activation and immunosuppression.Case Description: Patients who had an LT and were treated with ICIs (pre or post LT) at the University of Cincinnati were included in this retrospective chart review.Conclusions: Fatal rejection remains a significant risk even 4 years after LT. Neoadjuvant ICIs also pose a risk for acute cellular rejection; however, this may not always be clinically significant. Graft versus host disease (GVHD) may be an additional, previously unreported risk of ICIs in the setting of LT. Prospective studies are needed to understand benefits and risks of checkpoint inhibitors in the LT setting."

In addition to their role in advanced HCC, there is considerable interest in using ICIs in the neoadjuvant setting, either as a downstaging or bridging therapy, prior to potentially curative liver transplantation. In this article, we reviewed all the available literature on ICI use in this context. We postulate that ICIs may be utilized safely prior to liver transplant; however, further research is needed in this area. Liver transplantation offers excellent outcomes for patients with HCC. For those who initially present within the Milan criteria, bridging therapy is essential to control disease while awaiting liver transplant. For those who present beyond the Milan criteria, a liver transplant may still be considered following successful downstaging. Since the introduction of atezolizumab as part of the first-line treatment for HCC in 2020, there has been increasing interest in the use of ICIs as bridging or downstaging therapies prior to liver transplant. A total of six case reports/series have been published on this topic, with mixed outcomes. Overall, liver transplantation can be performed safely following prolonged ICI use, though ICIs may increase the risk of fulminant acute rejection early in the post-operative period. A minimal washout period between the last dose of ICI and liver transplantation has been identified as an important factor predicting transplant outcomes; however, further research is needed."

Recent advancements in hepatic arterial infusion chemotherapy (HAIC) and immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) have demonstrated higher tumor response rates, which improved overall survival (OS). HAIC achieves an OS rate of approximately 14.5-15.3 months with a 39.1-42.5% tumor response rate. In comparison, ICIs have a 12-14 month OS rate with a 26-33% tumor response rate. Given these promising responses, this study evaluates the efficacy of conversion therapy with curative intent following HAIC or ICIs, focusing on survival outcomes. Methods: We retrospectively analyzed 80 patients with advanced or TACE-unsuitable intermediate HCC. Patients completed two HAIC or four ICI cycles, followed by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) criteria imaging. Based on demographics, cirrhosis status, Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer classification (BCLC) stage, treatment responses, and treatment modality, survival impacts were analyzed. OS was compared between HAIC and immunotherapy groups. The effect of conversion therapy with curative intent on survival outcomes was analyzed using a Cox regression model. Results: Among the 80 patients, 26 achieved positive response (CR/PR) with HAIC or ICIs, and 9 of them subsequently underwent conversion therapy with curative intent. Key prognostic factors included Child-Pugh stage B versus A (HR = 2.21, p = 0.041), BCLC stage C versus B (HR = 4.38, p = 0.011), and elevated alpha-fetoprotein levels (HR = 5.02, p < 0.001). Positive responders saw substantial survival benefits (HR = 0.26, p = 0.001). Patients undergoing conversion therapy exhibited significantly enhanced survival. Median OS was 13.58 months with standard therapy, while the curative intent surgery group did not reach the median OS (p = 0.002). For CR/PR patients, 48-month survival was 75.0% for the curative surgery group versus 38.0% for standard treatment. Conclusion: Conversion therapy with curative intent following HAIC or ICIs might enhance survival in patients with advanced or TACE-unsuitable intermediate-stage HCC."

Median OS was 13.58 months with standard therapy, while the curative intent surgery group did not reach the median OS (p = 0.002). For CR/PR patients, 48-month survival was 75.0% for the curative surgery group versus 38.0% for standard treatment. CONCLUSION: Conversion therapy with curative intent following HAIC or ICIs might enhance survival in patients with advanced or TACE-unsuitable intermediate-stage HCC."

However, using this treatment strategy to convert initially unresectable HCC to resectable HCC was not reported. Methods: Consecutive patients with unresectable HCC who received first-line therapy with combined TKI/anti-PD-1 antibodies were analyzed. Tumor response and resectability were evaluated via imaging every 2 months (+/- 2 weeks) using RECIST v1.1. Resectability criteria were (1) R0 resection could be achieved with sufficient remnant liver volume and function; (2) intrahepatic lesions were evaluated as partial responses or stable disease for at least 2 months; (3) no severe or persistent adverse effects occurred; and (4) hepatectomy was not contraindicated. Results: Sixty-three consecutive patients were enrolled. Of them, 10 (15.9%) underwent R0 resection in 3.2 months (range: 2.4-8.3 months) after the initiation of combination therapy. At baseline, these 10 patients had a median largest tumor diameter of 9.3 cm, 7 had Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer stage C (vascular invasion) disease, 2 had stage B, and 1 had stage A. Before surgery, 6 patients were evaluated as a partial response, 3 stable disease, and 1 partial response in the intrahepatic lesion but a new metastatic lesion in the right adrenal gland. Six patients (60%) achieved a pathological complete response. One patient died from immune-related adverse effects 2.4 months after hepatectomy. After a median follow-up of 11.2 months (range: 7.8-15.9 months) for other 9 patients, 8 survived without disease recurrence, and 1 experienced tumor recurrence. Conclusions: Combination of TKI/anti-PD-1 antibodies is a feasible conversion therapy for patients with unresectable HCC to become resectable. This study represents the largest patient cohort on downstaging role of combinational systemic therapy on TKI and PD-1 antibody for HCC."

Although immunotherapy has dramatically improved survival for immunocompetent patients and has become the standard of care for a variety of tumors, including HCC, it is mainly used outside the scope of organ transplantation owing to potentially fatal allograft rejection. Nevertheless, accumulative evidence has expanded the therapeutic paradigms of immunotherapy for HCC, from downstaging or bridging management in the pretransplant setting to the salvage or adjuvant strategy in the posttransplant setting. Generally, immunotherapy mainly includes immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs), adoptive cell transfer (ACT) and vaccine therapy. ICIs, followed by ACT, have been most investigated in LT, with some promising results. Because of the complex tumor microenvironment and immunoreactivity when immunosuppressants are combined with immunotherapy, it is difficult to reach formulations for immunosuppressant adjustment and the optimal selection of immunotherapy as well as patients. In addition, the absence of effective biomarkers for identifying rejection and tumor response is still an unresolved barrier to successful clinical immunotherapy applications for LT. In this review, we comprehensively summarize the available evidence of immunotherapy used in LT that is specific to HCC.

Patients who achieved complete response (CR) with systemic chemotherapy alone were excluded. Clinical factors possibly linked to successful transition to conversion therapy and the achievement of cancer-free status were identified. Results: Fifteen (8.0%) patients underwent conversion therapy. In the conversion group, there was a significantly higher proportion of patients with Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC) stage A or B (73.3% versus [vs.] 45.1%; p = .03) and tended to have lower Child-Pugh scores and alpha-fetoprotein levels. Multivariate analysis revealed that BCLC stage was a predictive factor for the implementation of conversion therapy (A or B; odds ratio 3.7 [95% CI: 1.1-13]; p = .04). Furthermore, 10 (66.7%) patients achieved cancer-free status and exhibited a smaller number of intrahepatic lesions at the start of treatment (3.5 vs. 7; p < .01), and a shorter interval between systemic chemotherapy induction and conversion therapy (131 vs. 404 days; p < .01).

In the perioperative setting, in addition to adjuvant and neo-adjuvant therapies, strategies for ""downstaging"" and ""bridging"" patients to liver transplantation (LT) are being investigated, broadening the eligible candidate pool. Furthermore, therapeutic advances have reshaped conversion strategies for hepatic resection, with emerging evidence indicating a role for adjuvant immunotherapy in patients at high risk of postoperative recurrence. In LT, concerns have arisen over the potential conflict between immunosuppression needs and the immune-enhancing effects of ICIs, with reports of severe rejection. However, liver-specific factors may lessen rejection risks, prompting exploration into the safety of pre-transplant ICI administration. Moreover, ongoing trials must prioritise patient selection and vigilant management protocols. Despite the remarkable progress in immunotherapy, the intricate molecular interactions within the tumour microenvironment and their implications on oncogenic pathways remain incompletely understood. This highlights the need for specialised expertise to effectively integrate immunotherapy into the surgical management of HCC. Key challenges include ensuring safety, optimising oncological outcomes, managing the risk of graft rejection in transplant recipients, and refining patient selection criteria.

Eleven patients (91.7%) with a modified albumin bilirubin (mALBI) grade 1 or 2a and BCLC-B stage showed significantly higher rates of transition during conversion therapy (p < 0.05). The patients undergoing conversion therapy had a significantly longer median overall survival rate than those receiving chemotherapy alone (1208 [1064-NA] vs. 569 [466-704] days, p < 0.01). A comparison of the patients who achieved a partial response with and without conversion was evaluated using propensity score matching to reduce the confounding factors, showing a significant survival benefit in the conversion group (1208 [1064-NA] vs. 665 days, p < 0.01). Among the patients with u-HCC who were treated with LEN and Atezo + Bev, those with mALBI 1 + 2a and BCLC-B were likely to achieve conversion therapy with downstaging."

The immune checkpoint inhibitor combination of atezolizumab plus bevacizumab was recently approved for the treatment of unresectable HCC, but there are few reports on the failure of the combination treatment. Here, we present a case of unresectable HCC with adrenal metastasis that was eventually operated on after lenvatinib (LEN) treatment that followed failed treatment with atezolizumab plus bevacizumab. Patient concerns: A 68-year-old man was diagnosed with non-alcoholic steatohepatitis-based HCC with adrenal metastasis. Diagnosis: Cirrhosis was classified as Child-Pugh score of 5. HCC was diagnosed as Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer stage C. Interventions: We initiated treatment with atezolizumab plus bevacizumab. Liver dysfunction appeared 2 days after the first administration but was improved by intravenous rehydration and did not appear after the second course. The HCC shrank, but the adrenal metastasis grew bigger after the fourth course, so we changed the therapy to LEN. After HCC and adrenal metastasis were necrotic by LEN, conversion surgery was performed. Outcomes: After successful conversion therapy, the general condition of the patient was good, and has been carefully followed for 4 months to date without any evidence of further recurrences. Lessons: This case showed that even if atezolizumab plus bevacizumab is not effective, multidisciplinary treatment such as LEN and conversion surgery is possible. Given the efficacy of LEN after atezolizumab plus bevacizumab, it is important to consider that there is a possibility of cure even when first-line treatment is not effective for a patient with unresectable HCC."

Conversion therapy, as an emerging treatment, is designed to provide patients with initially unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (uHCC) the opportunity to undergo radical resection. At present, conversion therapy for patients with uHCC remains controversial. Transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) is currently the most widely selected treatment for uHCC, but its efficacy as a conversion therapy remains controversial. MethodsWe compared and evaluated the conversion rate for and tumor response to TACE monotherapy or combination therapy. Meanwhile, postoperative complications and overall survival (OS) in uHCC patients who underwent conversion therapy were also analyzed. ResultsA total of 18 studies were included in this meta-analysis. The conversion rate for triple therapy [TACE in combination with tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) and immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs)] was 42% [95% confidence interval (CI), 0.29-0.56], higher than any other group [TACE monotherapy: 10% (95% CI, 0.08-0.12), bigeminy therapy: 19% (95% CI, 0.06-0.36)]. Meanwhile, triple therapy yielded a better tumor response than TACE monotherapy or bigeminy therapy. Among the patients with successful surgical resection after conversion therapy, the pooled postoperative OS rates at 1, 2, and 5 years were 90% (95% CI, 0.81-0.97), 58% (95% CI, 0.42-0.73), and 42% (95% CI, 0.26-0.60), respectively, and the major postoperative complications were biliary leakage (7%; 95% CI, 0.03-0.12) and liver failure (3%; 95% CI, 0.00-0.07).

MethodsPatients with initially unresectable HCC who received combined lenvatinib and anti-PD-1 antibody between May 2020 and Jan 2022 in Zhongshan Hospital were retrospectively analyzed. Tumor response and resectability were assessed by imaging every two months according to RECIST version 1.1 and modified RECIST (mRECIST) criteria. ResultsA total of 107 patients were enrolled. 30 (28%) of them received conversion surgery within 90.5 (range: 53-456) days after the initiation of lenvatinib plus anti-PD-1 therapy. At baseline, the median largest tumor diameter of these 30 patients was 9.2 cm (range: 3.5-15.0 cm), 26 patients had Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer stage B-C, and 4 had stage A. Prior to surgery, all cases displayed tumor regression and 15 patients achieved objective response. Pathological complete response (pCR) was observed in 10 patients. No severe drug-related adverse events or surgical complications were observed. After a median follow-up of 16.5 months, 28 patients survived and 11 developed tumor recurrence.

Case 2, a 68-year-old man, was diagnosed with HCC (maximum diameter: 14 cm). Hepatic resection was difficult because the residual liver volume after treatment would be insufficient. Five cycles of atezolizumab-bevacizumab therapy were performed, and marked shrinkage of the HCC to a maximum diameter of 9 cm was confirmed. The treatment was converted to CIRT, and atezolizumab-bevacizumab therapy resumed one month after CIRT. The treatment effect at 3 months after CIRT was judged as CR according to mRECIST. Although conversion therapy after atezolizumab-bevacizumab therapy, including surgery and radiofrequency ablation, have been reported, CIRT may be a promising new tool for conversion therapy for HCC."

We investigated the clinicopathological characteristics and prognosis of patients with initially unresectable HCC who underwent hepatectomy after conversion therapy with hepatic arterial infusion chemotherapy (HAIC), tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), and anti-PD-1 antibodies. Materials and Methods: Patients with initially unresectable HCC who received HAIC combined with TKIs and anti-PD-1 antibodies followed by hepatectomy between December 2020 and December 2022, were retrospectively analyzed. Patient characteristics, tumor characteristics, treatment efficacy, perioperative characteristics, pathological characteristics, and survival outcomes were summarized and analyzed. Results: 67 patients were enrolled in this study. Patients were treated with 3 sessions (range:2-6 sessions) of combination therapy and were performed with hepatectomy in 4 months (range:1.4-17.8 months) after the initiation of the combination therapy. The median size of tumor shrinkage was 4.7 cm (range:0.9-11.7 cm). A pathological complete response (pCR) was achieved in 34.3% of the patients (n = 23). The median recurrence-free survival (RFS) was 19.3 months and the median overall survival (OS) was 28.7 months.

Here, the change in the treatment strategy for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) using atezolizumab plus bevacizumab combination therapy is reviewed. The phase 3 IMbrave150 clinical trial was successful because of the direct antitumor effect of bevacizumab, which shifted the suppressive immune microenvironment to a responsive immune microenvironment, in addition to its synergistic effects when combined with atezolizumab. The analysis of CR cases was effective in patients with poor conditions, particularly tumor invasion in the main portal trunk (Vp4), making the combination therapy a breakthrough for HCC treatment. The response rate of the combination therapy was 44% against intermediate-stage HCC. Such a strong tumor-reduction effect paves the way for curative conversion (ABC conversion) therapy and, therefore, treatment strategies for intermediate-stage HCC may undergo a significant shift in the future. As these treatment strategies are effective in maintaining liver function, even in elderly patients, the transition frequency to second-line treatments could also be improved.

In this study, we investigate the clinical efficacy and the safety profile of pre-transplant administration of atezolizumab and bevacizumab for HCC. Methods: Herein, we performed a prospective assessment of 17 patients with HCC treated with neoadjuvant preoperative atezolizumab and bevacizumab prior to LT for HCC, obtained from December 2020 and December 2023 at seven Western transplant centers. Results: Among the 17 patients with HCC included in the study, 16 (94.1%) had a tumor burden outside of Milan criteria. Neoadjuvant locoregional therapies along with the administration of atezolizumab plus bevacizumab (median: 5 months; discontinued at least 4 weeks prior to LT) led to an objective response rate of 94% (complete response: 59%), downstaging to within Milan criteria (82%) and a pathological response at explant examination of 88%.

Immunotherapies as neoadjuvant options are now being actively investigated in the transplant oncology era to enhance outcomes in patients with HCC. Here, we report our experience with patients with HCC who had received Immune Checkpoint Inhibitors (ICPI) prior to curative OLT. Methods: This was a retrospective cohort that included patients with HCC who received ICPI prior to OLT at a single institution from January 2019 to August 2023. Graft rejection was assessed and reported along with the type of ICPI, malignancy treated, and the timing of ICPI in association with OLT. Results: During this cohort period, six patients with HCC underwent OLT after neoadjuvant ICPI. All patients were male with a median age of 61 (interquartile range: 59-64) years at OLT. Etiology associated with HCC was viral (N = 4) or Non-alcoholic steatohepatitis, NASH (N = 2). Tumor focality was multifocal (N = 4) and unifocal (N = 2). Lymphovascular invasion was identified in four patients. No perineural invasion was identified in any of the patients. All patients received ICPI including atezolizumab/bevacizumab (N = 4), nivolumab/ipilimumab (N = 1), and nivolumab as monotherapy (N = 1). All patients received either single or combined liver-directed/locoregional therapy, including transarterial chemoembolization (TACE), Yttrium-90 (Y90), stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT), and radiofrequency ablation (RFA). The median washout period was 5 months. All patients responded to ICPI and achieved a safe and successful OLT. All patients received tacrolimus plus mycophenolate as immunosuppressant (IS) therapy post-OLT and one patient received prednisone as additional IS. No patient had clinical evidence of rejection. Conclusions: This cohort emphasizes the success of tumor downstaging by ICPI for OLT when employed as the neoadjuvant therapy strategy. In addition, this study illustrated the importance of timing for the administration of ICPI before OLT. Given the lack of conclusive evidence in this therapeutic area, we believe that our study lays the groundwork for prospective trials to further examine the impact of ICPI prior to OLT."

Results: During this cohort period, six patients with HCC underwent OLT after neoadjuvant ICPI. All patients were male with a median age of 61 (interquartile range: 59-64) years at OLT. Etiology associated with HCC was viral (N = 4) or Non-alcoholic steatohepatitis, NASH (N = 2). Tumor focality was multifocal (N = 4) and unifocal (N = 2). Lymphovascular invasion was identified in four patients. No perineural invasion was identified in any of the patients. All patients received ICPI including atezolizumab/bevacizumab (N = 4), nivolumab/ipilimumab (N = 1), and nivolumab as monotherapy (N = 1). All patients received either single or combined liver-directed/locoregional therapy, including transarterial chemoembolization (TACE), Yttrium-90 (Y90), stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT), and radiofrequency ablation (RFA). The median washout period was 5 months. All patients responded to ICPI and achieved a safe and successful OLT. All patients received tacrolimus plus mycophenolate as immunosuppressant (IS) therapy post-OLT and one patient received prednisone as additional IS. No patient had clinical evidence of rejection. Conclusions: This cohort emphasizes the success of tumor downstaging by ICPI for OLT when employed as the neoadjuvant therapy strategy. In addition, this study illustrated the importance of timing for the administration of ICPI before OLT. Given the lack of conclusive evidence in this therapeutic area, we believe that our study lays the groundwork for prospective trials to further examine the impact of ICPI prior to OLT."

Mutual efficacy enhancement has been reported between radiotherapy, anti-angiogenesis therapy and immunotherapy in preclinical researches, but not been validated in clinical practice. Whether radiotherapy can enhance efficacy of anti-PD-1 immunotherapy plus bevacizumab for HCC remains unclear. This retrospective observational study aimed to appraise efficacy and safety of the combination of radiotherapy with pembrolizumab (a PD-1 monoclonal antibody) and bevacizumab for advanced HCC for the first time. Methods: Patients with advanced HCC treated by intrahepatic tumor-directed moderately hypofractionated radiotherapy combined with pembrolizumab and bevacizumab were consecutively included. Clinicopathological characteristics, therapeutic outcomes and treatment-related adverse events (TRAEs) were recorded and evaluated. Results: A total of 23 patients were eventually enrolled. Median cycles of pembrolizumab and bevacizumab were 4 (median, 1-8) and 4 (median, 1-9) cycles. The objective response rates and disease control rates of irradiated intrahepatic HCC and non-irradiated extrahepatic HCC were 34.8% [95% confidence interval (CI), 16.4-57.3%] vs. 10.0% (95% CI, 1.2-31.7%), and 91.3% (95% CI, 72.0-98.9%) vs. 70.0% (95% CI, 45.7-88.1%), respectively. The median progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) were 6.6 (95% CI, 4.7-8.5) and 18.3 (95% CI, 8.2-33.6) months, and 12-month PFS and OS rates were 17.5% (95% CI, 7.0-28.0%) and 60.9% (95% CI, 50.7-71.1%).

Methods: This retrospective study enrolled 156 patients who were Child-Pugh class A with u-HCC treated using Atez/Beva. The profile of objective response was investigated using decision-tree analysis. Progression-free, recurrence-free, and overall survival were assessed. Results: The progression-free and overall survival were 6.1 and 18.0 months, respectively. Objective response and disease control rates were 32.0% and 84.0%, respectively. Decision-tree analysis revealed that neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) <3, modified albumin-bilirubin grade (m-ALBI) 1 or 2a, and age < 75 were sequential splitting variables for the objective response, respectively. In the multivariate analysis, NLR <3 and m-ALBI grade 1 or 2a were identified as predictive factors for objective response. We successfully achieved eligibility for conversion therapy in 17 patients after Atez/Bev therapy significant response. Following conversion therapy, the curative therapy group, including surgical resection or radiofrequency ablation (RFA), had significantly higher recurrence-free survival than did the transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (TACE) and Atez/Bev discontinuation (surgical resection or RFA; not reached vs. TACE; 5.3 months, p = 0.008, Atez/Bev discontinuation; 3.9 months, p = 0.048, respectively) groups.

Case presentation A 45-year-old man was diagnosed with a bulky HCC under cirrhotic background without distant metastasis. Curative resection was infeasible, and TACE plus tislelizumab (an ICI targeting PD-1) was applied. The treatment course, starting from TACE and followed by tislelizumab one week later, was repeated every four weeks. After three courses, the tumor showed striking shrink in volume with complete radiological response, which permitted salvage resection. Notably, pathological examination found complete necrosis of the tumor with massive infiltration of lymphocytes in the tumor-nontumor interface and extensive granulomatous inflammation in the surrounding nontumor liver, indicating activated immune response synergistically caused by TACE with tislelizumab. The patient is now living well without tumor recurrence for 6 months after surgery. Conclusion TACE in combination with tislelizumab may represent a potent strategy for uHCC.

HCC occurs in patients with hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection and cirrhosis at 1-4% per year. Direct-acting antiviral (DAA) efficacy is decreased in the presence of HCC. We present a case where immunotherapy may have resulted in HCV clearance, when DAA therapy had been ineffective. We hypothesise that immune checkpoint inhibitors targeting the PD-1/PD-L1 pathway can reverse T-cell exhaustion and aid in the clearance of chronic HCV. Case Presentation: This case study describes a male in his 40 s identified by a re-engagement initiative for HCV, who had been unaware of his diagnosis. On further investigation he was found to have compensated for liver cirrhosis and HCC. He was treated with HCV DAA therapy (sofosbuvir/velpatasvir) and then systemic immunotherapy for HCC with atezolizumab and bevacizumab, in an attempt to downstage the disease. Hepatitis C therapy did not achieve sustained virological response, with viral relapse after the end of treatment. This, combined with ongoing alcohol use, resulted in hepatic decompensation and cessation of immunotherapy after the fifth cycle. The HCV RNA subsequently became undetectable without further DAA re-treatment. Conclusion: To our knowledge, this is the first case of HCV clearance after DAA relapse and the timing of this event after immunotherapy suggests a causal link. We hypothesise that this may be due to the reversal of antiviral T-cell exhaustion. This would therefore support further investigation into other chronic viral infections that create tumour associated with immunosuppressive microenvironments. (c) 2024 The Author(s). Published by S.

However, HCC can be effectively treated in selected cases, with liver transplantation representing one of the limited options for potential cure. Unfortunately, many patients are ineligible for liver transplantation either due to an advanced tumor at initial diagnosis or due to disease progression while awaiting liver transplantation. Our review discusses the role of systemic therapies as a bridging treatment to liver transplantation, thereby enabling more HCC patients to undergo potentially curative liver transplantation.Abstract Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the third most common cause of cancer-related deaths. Classically, liver transplantation (LT) can be curative for HCC tumors within the Milan criteria. Bridging strategies to reduce the dropouts from LT waiting lists and/or to downstage patients who are beyond the Milan criteria are widely utilized. We conducted a literature-based review to evaluate the role of systemic therapies as a bridging treatment to liver transplantation (LT) in HCC patients. Tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) can be used as a systemic bridging therapy to LT in patients with contraindications for locoregional liver-directed therapies. Immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) treatment can be utilized either as a monotherapy or as a combination therapy with bevacizumab or TKIs prior to LT. Acute rejection after liver transplantation is a concern in the context of ICI treatment. Thus, a safe ICI washout period before LT and cautious post-LT immunosuppression strategies are required to reduce post-LT rejections and to optimize clinical outcomes. Nevertheless, prospective clinical trials are needed to establish definitive conclusions about the utility of systemic therapy as a bridging modality prior to LT in HCC patients."

Transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) combined with immune checkpoint inhibitors or tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) can partially transform some unresectable HCC and improve the prognosis effectively. However, based on the promising prospects of combined targeted and immunotherapy for the effective treatment of HCC, the positive role of palliative surgery in the conversion treatment of advanced HCC urgently needs further intensive re-assessment. CASE SUMMARY In this study, we describe two successful cases of ""conversion therapy for unresectable HCC"" achieved mainly by palliative surgery combined with TACE plus immunotherapy and TKIs. A 48-year-old patient with newly diagnosed HCC, presenting with a 6-cm mass in the segment VII/VIII of the right liver with multiple intrahepatic metastases, could not undergo one-stage radical surgical resection. He underwent palliative surgery with radiofrequency of metastatic lesions and the palliative resection of the primary mass, and received subsequent TACE treatments twice in the early postoperative period (2 weeks and 6 weeks), in addition to targeted and immune combination therapy with sintilimab injection and oral lenvatinib. No evidence of recurrence was observed during the 11-month follow-up period after surgery. The other patient was a 47-year-old patient with massive HCC (18 cm x 15 cm x 4.5 cm) in the left liver with severe cirrhosis. The left portal branch was occluded and a tumor thrombus formed, and the tumor partly involved the middle hepatic vein. The patient underwent palliative surgery of left hemihepatectomy (including resection of the middle hepatic vein) for HCC, followed by three TACE procedures and oral TKIs 2 weeks after surgery. Six months later, the re-examination via computed tomography revealed no tumour activity in the remaining right liver, while magnetic resonance imaging revealed slight local tumor enhancement in the caudate lobe of the liver considered, TACE was performed once again, and during the next follow-up of 10 months did not reveal new intrahepatic lesions or distant metastases. CONCLUSION These cases demonstrate that the addition of palliative surgery to conversion therapy in a selected population with a high tumor burden could benefit patients with initially unresectable HCC."

This paper discusses predictors of recurrence of HCC in patients who have undergone surgical resection and addresses adjuvant therapies aimed at decreasing recurrence risk and improving overall survival (OS) outcomes, including traditional cytotoxic chemotherapies, tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), and immunotherapy. This article also discusses neoadjuvant strategies aimed at improving recurrence rate and OS as well as downstaging advanced HCC to enable surgical disease, including locoregional therapies, systemic chemotherapy, TKIs, and immune checkpoint inhibitors. Finally, this article addresses potential future directions for both adjuvant and neoadjuvant therapies that may change the treatment paradigm of HCC in the near future."

They were converted successfully by the triple combination treatment and underwent or did not undergo salvage resection. The baseline characteristics, conversion schemes, conversion treatment-related adverse events (CTRAEs), overall survival (OS), and progression-free survival (PFS) of the salvage surgery and non-surgery groups were compared. Multivariate Cox regression analysis was performed to identify independent risk factors for OS and PFS. Additionally, subgroup survival analysis was conducted by stratification of degree of tumor response and type of PVTT.Results Of the 93 patients, 44 underwent salvage surgery, and 49 did not undergo salvage surgery. The OS and PFS of the salvage surgery and non-surgery groups were not significantly different (P = .370 and .334, respectively). The incidence and severity of CTRAEs of the 2 groups were also comparable. Subgroup analyses revealed that for patients with complete response (CR) or types III-IV PVTT, there was a trend toward better survival in patients who did not undergo salvage surgery. Multivariate analysis showed that baseline alpha-fetoprotein and best tumor response per mRECIST criteria were independent prognostic factors for OS and PFS.Conclusions For patients with initially unresectable HCC and PVTT who were successfully converted by the triple combination therapy, salvage liver resection may not be necessary, especially for the patients with CR or types III-IV PVTT.

Surgical resection is the cornerstone of therapy and represents the best potentially curative treatment option. Modest objective responses with cytotoxic chemotherapy alone or combined with immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) have been reported; however, there are no established systemic therapy regimens for unresectable or metastatic FLC. Case Presentation: We report a case of a 23-year-old woman with FLC who presented with a 11.5 x 8.3 cm left liver mass and subsequently underwent resection as initial therapy. Molecular analysis of her surgical tissue revealed a DNAJB1-PRKACA fusion gene. The patient developed biopsy-proven recurrent FLC with multiple liver lesions but without any distant metastatic disease only 3 months after initial resection. In light of emerging data, the patient was treated with a novel triple therapy regimen including 5-fluorouracil (5-FU), interferon (IFN) alfa-2b, and nivolumab. Partial radiographic response was achieved after 4 treatments and complete response was achieved after 12 cycles with the combination. The patient received 2 more doses of 5-FU/IFN alfa-2b without nivolumab and underwent orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT) 6 months after the last dose of ICI. Pathological examination of the explanted liver remarkably confirmed pathologic complete response. She remains recurrence-free and is on active surveillance. Discussion/Conclusion: For patients with unresectable/recurrent FLC with no distant disease, the combination of 5-FU, IFN alfa-2b, and nivolumab could be an effective systemic therapy option. The use of this chemoimmunotherapy regimen to downstage FLC prior to OLT may be worth investigating further. (C) 2022 S. Karger AG, Basel"

Safety was also analysed in the intention-to-treat population. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT03817736) and has been completed. Findings Between March 18, 2019, and Jan 27, 2021, 33 patients (32 [97%] men and one [3%] woman) were enrolled. The median sum of the largest diameters of lesions was 15 & BULL;1 cm (IQR 8 & BULL;3-14 & BULL;9). 21 (64%) patients had macrovascular invasion (hepatic vein [n=13], branched portal vein [n=3], or both [n=5]). Median follow-up was 17 & BULL;2 months (IQR 7 & BULL;8-25 & BULL;8). 18 (55%) patients were deemed amenable to curative treatment: four (12%) of 33 patients had curative treatment (resection [n=2] or radiofrequency ablation [n=2]), and 14 (42%) had a radiological complete response and opted for close surveillance. 11 (33%) of 33 patients had treatment-related adverse events that were grade 3 or worse. The most common treatment-related grade 3 or worse adverse event was transient increase in alanine aminotransferase or aspartate aminotransferase (five [15%]) after TACE. Five (15%) patients developed immune-related adverse events of grade 3 or worse (three had hepatitis, two had dermatitis). Interpretation To our knowledge, this is the first prospective trial using the combination of immunotherapy and locoregional treatment as conversion therapy for locally advanced unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma, with promising results. Future randomised trials with larger cohorts of patients are warranted."

Methods This retrospective analysis included Chinese patients with unresectable/advanced HCC who received first-line lenvatinib (8 mg/day) plus >= 3 infusions of anti-PD-1 antibodies between October 2018 and May 2020. Tumor and macrovascular tumor thrombi (MVTT) treatment responses were evaluated every 2 months using RECIST v1.1. The overall response rate (ORR)/OSRR was defined as the percentage of patients with a best overall response of complete or partial response (CR or PR). Results In total, 60 patients were included in the analysis; 96.7% had measurable intrahepatic lesions, 55% had MVTT and 26.7% had extrahepatic disease. In all 60 patients, the ORR was 33.3%, median progression-free survival was 7.0 months (95% CI, 1.7-12.3) and median overall survival was not reached. The OSRR for MVTT (54.5%) was higher versus intrahepatic tumors (32.8%), extrahepatic lung metastases (37.5%) and lymph node metastases (33.3%). Among 33 patients with intrahepatic tumors and MVTT, 18 had differential responses in each site, including 13 with a better response in MVTT versus intrahepatic lesions. Among 18 patients whose MVTT achieved a radiographic CR or PR, six underwent surgical resection: 4/6 achieved a pathological CR in MVTT and 2/6 in the intrahepatic tumor. Conclusions First-line lenvatinib plus anti-PD-1 antibodies resulted in better tumor responses in MVTT versus intrahepatic lesions. Complete MVTT necrosis may allow downstaging and subsequent eligibility for surgical resection in a proportion of patients with advanced HCC."

A previous study proved that low-dose radiotherapy (RT) could prolong the prognosis of HCC patients with PVTT. This study aims to explore the sensitivity of PVTT to RT treatment. Methods Patients were selected based on imaging diagnosis of HCC accompanied by PVTT and received combined treatment of radiotherapy, antiangiogenic drugs and immune checkpoint inhibitors, followed by hepatectomy or liver transplantation from January 2019 to August 2022. The efficacy was evaluated by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) guidelines and pathological assessment. The sensitivity of tumor cells to the treatment was compared between the primary tumor (PT)and PVTT by analyzing their residual tumor and pathologic complete remission (PCR) incidence. Results Data from 14 patients were collected in the study. After combined treatment, the size of PVTT decreased more significantly than that of the primary tumor in the imaging study (p < 0.05). The residual cancer was significantly more restrictive than that of primary tumor in paired patients based on pathological measurement (p = 0.008). The PCR incidence of the primary tumor (21.42%) was significantly lower (p = 0.008) than that of PVTT in the pathologic study (78.57%).

Integrated use of transarterial chemoembolization (TACE), a locoregional inducer of immunogenic cell death, with ICI has not been formally assessed for safety and efficacy outcomes. Methods From a retrospective multicenter dataset of 323 patients treated with ICI, we identified 31 patients who underwent >1 TACE 60 days before or concurrently, with nivolumab at a single center. We derived a propensity score-matched cohort of 104 patients based on Child-Pugh Score, portal vein thrombosis, extrahepatic metastasis and alpha fetoprotein (AFP) who received nivolumab monotherapy. We described overall survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS), objective responses according to modified RECIST criteria and safety in the multimodal arm in comparison to monotherapy. Results Over a median follow-up of 9.3 (IQR 4.0-16.4) months, patients undergoing multimodal immunotherapy with TACE achieved a significantly longer median (95% CI) PFS of 8.8 (6.2-23.2) vs 3.7 (2.7-5.4) months (log-rank 0.15, p<0.01) in the monotherapy group. Multimodal immunotherapy with TACE demonstrated a numerically longer OS compared with ICI monotherapy with a median 35.1 (16.1-Not Evaluable) vs 16.6 (15.7-32.6) months (log-rank 0.41, p=0.12). In the multimodal treatment group, there were three (10%) grade 3 or higher adverse events (AEs) attributed to immunotherapy compared with seven (6.7%) in the matched ICI monotherapy arm. There were no AEs grade 3 or higher attributed to TACE in the multimodal treatment arm. At 3 months following each TACE in the multimodal arm, there was an overall objective response rate of 84%. There were no significant changes in liver functional reserve 1 month following each TACE. Four patients undergoing multimodal treatment were successfully bridged to transplant.

Integrated use of transarterial chemoembolization (TACE), a locoregional inducer of immunogenic cell death, with ICI has not been formally assessed for safety and efficacy outcomes. METHODS: From a retrospective multicenter dataset of 323 patients treated with ICI, we identified 31 patients who underwent >1 TACE 60 days before or concurrently, with nivolumab at a single center. We derived a propensity score-matched cohort of 104 patients based on Child-Pugh Score, portal vein thrombosis, extrahepatic metastasis and alpha fetoprotein (AFP) who received nivolumab monotherapy. We described overall survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS), objective responses according to modified RECIST criteria and safety in the multimodal arm in comparison to monotherapy. RESULTS: Over a median follow-up of 9.3 (IQR 4.0-16.4) months, patients undergoing multimodal immunotherapy with TACE achieved a significantly longer median (95% CI) PFS of 8.8 (6.2-23.2) vs 3.7 (2.7-5.4) months (log-rank 0.15, p<0.01) in the monotherapy group. Multimodal immunotherapy with TACE demonstrated a numerically longer OS compared with ICI monotherapy with a median 35.1 (16.1-Not Evaluable) vs 16.6 (15.7-32.6) months (log-rank 0.41, p=0.12). In the multimodal treatment group, there were three (10%) grade 3 or higher adverse events (AEs) attributed to immunotherapy compared with seven (6.7%) in the matched ICI monotherapy arm. There were no AEs grade 3 or higher attributed to TACE in the multimodal treatment arm. At 3 months following each TACE in the multimodal arm, there was an overall objective response rate of 84%. There were no significant changes in liver functional reserve 1 month following each TACE. Four patients undergoing multimodal treatment were successfully bridged to transplant. CONCLUSIONS: TACE can be safely integrated with programmed cell death 1 blockade and may lead to a significant delay in tumor progression and disease downstaging in selected patients. commercial re-use.

METHODS: This multicenter retrospective study included 74 patients with uHCC and positive AFP (>20 ng/mL) at diagnosis, who underwent salvage hepatectomy after treatment with TKIs and anti-PD-1 antibody-based regimens. The association between AFP response-defined as a ≥ 80% decrease in final AFP levels before salvage hepatectomy from diagnosis-and RFS post-hepatectomy was investigated. RESULTS: AFP responders demonstrated significantly better postoperative RFS compared to non-responders (P<0.001).

Portal vein tumor thrombosis (PVTT) is the most common form of macrovascular invasion related to HCC occurring in 10%-60% of patients. HCC with PVTT is usually characterized by worsening liver function, vulnerability to blood metastasis, higher incidence of complications associated with portal hypertension, and intolerance to treatment when compared with that without PVTT. If only treated with supportive care, the median survival of HCC with PVTT is about 2.7 months. In the past, sorafenib was the only recommended therapy by guidelines with limited effectiveness. This narrative review aimed to describe the current management options for HCC with PVTT. Data sources: We have reviewed literature from PubMed on the treatment of HCC with PVTT and compiled evidence-based facts on effective therapies available for different types of PVTT. Results: Sorafenib monotherapy is not much effective, but combining it with other methods can improve survival. Each type of PVTT can benefit from the combination of transarterial chemoembolization and sorafenib than sorafenib monotherapy. The tumor downstaging can be realized possibly after transarterial chemoembolization, but tumor invasion into the main trunk of the portal vein greatly impairs efficacy. Although surgery is a curative approach, it is often not recommended for Vp4 PVTT. Some new methods can broaden the indication, but further explorations are needed. Radiotherapy can decrease the possibility of Vp3 progression to Vp4, but building a forecast model of best radiation dose and response is necessary. Systemic chemotherapy, hepatic arterial infusion chemotherapy, radiofrequency ablation, portal stenting, and traditional Chinese medicine are also beneficial in Vp3-4 PVTT. The accurate diagnosis of PVTT can be made by radiomics, and prognostic classification models can be used to design personalized treatments. The application of new treatment methods such as the atezolizumab plus bevacizumab scheme may increase survival. Conclusions: HCC with PVTT is still a thorny problem, and effective therapeutics need to be explored. (c) 2021 First Affiliated Hospital, Zhejiang University School of Medicine in China.

173,121,121,In the Era of Systemic Therapy for Hepatocellular Carcinoma Is Transarterial Chemoembolization Still a Card to Play?,"Bucalau, AM; Tancredi, I; Verset, G",10.3390/cancers13205129,"Simple Summary: Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a growing healthcare problem, with most of the cases occurring in patients with an underlying chronic liver disease. Transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) is recommended for unresectable tumors, mostly in a palliative setting. Several developments have seen the day during the last few years, with technique improvements in terms of efficacy and safety due to more selective therapies and better patient selection. Nevertheless, this is the era of systemic treatment for HCC, where immunotherapy and combination systemic treatments are taking the lead. As such, we have to ask ourselves, where does TACE stand today and is there a tomorrow? Conventional transarterial embolization (cTACE) has been proven to be effective for intermediate stage hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), with a recent systematic review showing an overall survival (OS) of 19.4 months. Nevertheless, due to the rapid development of the systemic therapeutic landscape, the place of TACE is becoming questionable. Is there still a niche for TACE in the era of immunotherapy and combination treatments such as atezolizumab-bevacizumab, which has shown an OS of 19.2 months with excellent tolerance? The development of drug-eluting microspheres (DEMs) has led to the standardization of the technique, and along with adequate selection, it showed an OS of 48 months in a retrospective study. In order to increase treatment selectivity, new catheters have also been added to the TACE arsenal as well as the use of cone-beam CT (CBCT), which provides three-dimensional volumetric images and guidance during procedures. Moreover, the TACE indications have also widened. It may serve as a ""bridging therapy "" for liver transplantation candidates while they are on the waiting list, and it represents a valuable downstaging tool to transplantation criteria. The aim of this review is to explore the current data on the advancements of TACE and its future place amongst the growing panel of treatments."

With advances in locoregional therapy for unresectable HCC during the last 2 decades and the recent expansion of transplant criteria for HCC, as well as ongoing organ shortages, patients are spending more time on the waitlist, which has resulted in increased usage of locoregional therapies. This changing landscape is well displayedin Fig. 1, which demonstrates the number of treatments per patient by year of listing (A) and the proportion of locoregional therapy type by year of treatment (B).91 Less than half of liver transplant candidates on the waiting list underwent locoregional therapy before listing in 2003, whereas 92.4% underwent some form of locoregional therapy in 2018.91 Although TACE is the current preferred modality for liver-directed therapy as a bridge to transplant in patients with HCC, recent evidence suggests that radioembolization may prolong time to progression when compared with chemoembolization. In just the last 5 years, the proportion of radioembolization performed for HCC has increased significantly, from less than 5% in 2013 to 19% in 2018.91 Expanding on the proven value of locoregional therapies, the plethora of molecularly targeted therapies and ICIs under investigation represent the new horizon of treatment of HCC not only in advanced stages but also potentially at every stage of diagnosis and management. Although data remain sparse in the pretransplantation population, the possibility of downstaging patients previously considered unresectable or initially outside of transplant criteria is an extremely alluring strategy, which may prove vital in establishing transplant candidacy for an expanded host of patients. Combination therapies have already begun to show promise in maintaining disease control and may ultimately prove lifesaving in patients who are able to undergo liver transplant. Although it will be critical in the coming years to determine timing of therapy and appropriate postoperative immunosuppression strategies, both locoregional techniques and immunomodulation will change the history of liver transplant for HCC as we currently know it."

This study aimed to evaluate the safety and medium-term clinical efficacy of DEB-TACE combined with lenvatinib (LEN) plus PD-1 inhibitors as a triple therapy for the treatment of uHCC.Methods: Data of patients with uHCC who received triple therapy of DEB-TACE combined with LEN plus PD-1 inhibitors from January 2019 to June 2021 were analyzed retrospectively. The study endpoints were ORR, progression-free survival (PFS), and treatment-related adverse events based on the modified Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (mRECIST).Results: Thirty-five patients were included in this study, with a median follow-up period of 15 months. The median cycle of DEB-TACE was 1, while that of all forms of TACE procedures per patient was 2. The median administration time of LEN was 7 months, and the median number of PD-1 inhibitor treatment was 4 cycles. The ORR based on mRECIST was 82.9%, disease control rate was 91.4%, and the median time to response was 7 weeks. Among these, the ORR of Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC) stage A reached 100%, while that of BCLC stages B and C reached 84.6% and 78.9%, respectively. The median PFS was 9 months; the mOS was not reached. Fourteen patients (40%) successfully underwent downstaging conversion and surgical resection, 32 patients (91.4%) experienced treatment-related adverse events, and no grade 5-related adverse reactions occurred.Conclusion: DEB-TACE combined with LEN and PD-1 inhibitors has a high ORR and surgical conversion rate in the treatment of uHCC tumors, and the toxicity and side effects were tolerable."

Early post-transplant acute cellular rejec-tion has rarely led to graft loss. We report the first case of 2 forms of nivolumab-associated liver injury on biopsy of the allograft organ in a single patient who received nivolumab for cancer downstaging before liver transplantation: 1. mild acute cellular rejection according to Risk Anal-ysis Index scoring and 2. zone 3 inflammation and apoptosis consistent with a more classic drug -induced liver injury pattern. This case not only adds further evidence about the risk for rejection post-transplant, but sheds light on other injuries checkpoint inhibitors can cause to the allograft."

The management and optimization of overall survival strategies, accompanied by an arguably decent quality of life, have been at the forefront of liver oncology treatment, as a plurality of all primary liver cancers are identified as either hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) or cholangiocarcinoma (CCA), which are classified as highly aggressive malignancies and frequently remain asymptomatic until they progress to advanced stages, rendering curative procedures, such as resection, impractical. This has led to an increase in utilization of neoadjuvant interventions conducted prior to surgery, which has yielded favorable outcomes. Though this treatment modality has prompted further investigations into the efficacy of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICPIs) as standalone treatments and in combination with locoregional treatments (LRTs) to bridge more patients into curative eligibility. This multidisciplinary methodology and treatment planning has seen multiple successful trials of immunotherapy regimes and combinate treatments, setting the groundwork for increasing eligibility through downstaging and ""bridging"" previously ineligible patients within stringent LT criteria. Surveillance after LT is a crucial component of transplant oncology. The emergence of circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) has provided a novel approach to identifying the recurrence of cancer in its early stages. Recent research has focused on liquid biopsy, a technique that effectively identifies the dynamics of cancer. This is another innovation to demonstrate the rate at which transplant oncology is rapidly advancing, making the focus of care feel disorienting. Modalities of care are constantly evolving, but when a field is changing as rapidly as this one, it is imperative to reorient to the data and the needs of the patients.
