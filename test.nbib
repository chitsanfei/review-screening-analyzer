AB  - BACKGROUND: No adjuvant treatment has been established for patients who remain at 
      high risk for hepatocellular carcinoma recurrence after curative-intent resection 
      or ablation. We aimed to assess the efficacy of adjuvant atezolizumab plus 
      bevacizumab versus active surveillance in patients with high-risk hepatocellular 
      carcinoma. METHODS: In the global, open-label, phase 3 IMbrave050 study, adult 
      patients with high-risk surgically resected or ablated hepatocellular carcinoma 
      were recruited from 134 hospitals and medical centres in 26 countries in four WHO 
      regions (European region, region of the Americas, South-East Asia region, and 
      Western Pacific region). Patients were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio via an 
      interactive voice-web response system using permuted blocks, using a block size 
      of 4, to receive intravenous 1200 mg atezolizumab plus 15 mg/kg bevacizumab every 
      3 weeks for 17 cycles (12 months) or to active surveillance. The primary endpoint 
      was recurrence-free survival by independent review facility assessment in the 
      intention-to-treat population. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, 
      NCT04102098. FINDINGS: The intention-to-treat population included 668 patients 
      randomly assigned between Dec 31, 2019, and Nov 25, 2021, to either atezolizumab 
      plus bevacizumab (n=334) or to active surveillance (n=334). At the prespecified 
      interim analysis (Oct 21, 2022), median duration of follow-up was 17·4 months 
      (IQR 13·9-22·1). Adjuvant atezolizumab plus bevacizumab was associated with 
      significantly improved recurrence-free survival (median, not evaluable [NE]; [95% 
      CI 22·1-NE]) compared with active surveillance (median, NE [21·4-NE]; hazard 
      ratio, 0·72 [adjusted 95% CI 0·53-0·98]; p=0·012). Grade 3 or 4 adverse events 
      occurred in 136 (41%) of 332 patients who received atezolizumab plus bevacizumab 
      and 44 (13%) of 330 patients in the active surveillance group. Grade 5 adverse 
      events occurred in six patients (2%, two of which were treatment related) in the 
      atezolizumab plus bevacizumab group, and one patient (<1%) in the active 
      surveillance group. Both atezolizumab and bevacizumab were discontinued because 
      of adverse events in 29 patients (9%) who received atezolizumab plus bevacizumab. 
      INTERPRETATION: Among patients at high risk of hepatocellular carcinoma 
      recurrence following curative-intent resection or ablation, recurrence-free 
      survival was improved in those who received atezolizumab plus bevacizumab versus 
      active surveillance. To our knowledge, IMbrave050 is the first phase 3 study of 
      adjuvant treatment for hepatocellular carcinoma to report positive results. 
      However, longer follow-up for both recurrence-free and overall survival is needed 
      to assess the benefit-risk profile more fully. FUNDING: F Hoffmann-La 
      Roche/Genentech.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Biliary tract cancers, which arise from the intrahepatic or 
      extrahepatic bile ducts and the gallbladder, generally have a poor prognosis and 
      are rising in incidence worldwide. The standard-of-care treatment for advanced 
      biliary tract cancer is chemotherapy with gemcitabine and cisplatin. Because most 
      biliary tract cancers have an immune-suppressed microenvironment, immune 
      checkpoint inhibitor monotherapy is associated with a low objective response 
      rate. We aimed to assess whether adding the immune checkpoint inhibitor 
      pembrolizumab to gemcitabine and cisplatin would improve outcomes compared with 
      gemcitabine and cisplatin alone in patients with advanced biliary tract cancer. 
      METHODS: KEYNOTE-966 was a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 3 
      trial done at 175 medical centres globally. Eligible participants were aged 18 
      years or older; had previously untreated, unresectable, locally advanced or 
      metastatic biliary tract cancer; had disease measurable per Response Evaluation 
      Criteria in Solid Tumours version 1.1; and had an Eastern Cooperative Oncology 
      Group performance status of 0 or 1. Eligible participants were randomly assigned 
      (1:1) to pembrolizumab 200 mg or placebo, both administered intravenously every 3 
      weeks (maximum 35 cycles), in combination with gemcitabine (1000 mg/m(2) 
      intravenously on days 1 and 8 every 3 weeks; no maximum duration) and cisplatin 
      (25 mg/m(2) intravenously on days 1 and 8 every 3 weeks; maximum 8 cycles). 
      Randomisation was done using a central interactive voice-response system and 
      stratified by geographical region, disease stage, and site of origin in block 
      sizes of four. The primary endpoint of overall survival was evaluated in the 
      intention-to-treat population. The secondary endpoint of safety was evaluated in 
      the as-treated population. This study is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, 
      NCT04003636. FINDINGS: Between Oct 4, 2019, and June 8, 2021, 1564 patients were 
      screened for eligibility, 1069 of whom were randomly assigned to pembrolizumab 
      plus gemcitabine and cisplatin (pembrolizumab group; n=533) or placebo plus 
      gemcitabine and cisplatin (placebo group; n=536). Median study follow-up at final 
      analysis was 25·6 months (IQR 21·7-30·4). Median overall survival was 12·7 months 
      (95% CI 11·5-13·6) in the pembrolizumab group versus 10·9 months (9·9-11·6) in 
      the placebo group (hazard ratio 0·83 [95% CI 0·72-0·95]; one-sided p=0·0034 
      [significance threshold, p=0·0200]). In the as-treated population, the maximum 
      adverse event grade was 3 to 4 in 420 (79%) of 529 participants in the 
      pembrolizumab group and 400 (75%) of 534 in the placebo group; 369 (70%) 
      participants in the pembrolizumab group and 367 (69%) in the placebo group had 
      treatment-related adverse events with a maximum grade of 3 to 4. 31 (6%) 
      participants in the pembrolizumab group and 49 (9%) in the placebo group died due 
      to adverse events, including eight (2%) in the pembrolizumab group and three (1%) 
      in the placebo group who died due to treatment-related adverse events. 
      INTERPRETATION: Based on a statistically significant, clinically meaningful 
      improvement in overall survival compared with gemcitabine and cisplatin without 
      any new safety signals, pembrolizumab plus gemcitabine and cisplatin could be a 
      new treatment option for patients with previously untreated metastatic or 
      unresectable biliary tract cancer. FUNDING: Merck Sharp & Dohme, a subsidiary of

AB  - BACKGROUND: In the phase III HIMALAYA study (NCT03298451) in unresectable 
      hepatocellular carcinoma (uHCC), STRIDE (Single Tremelimumab Regular Interval 
      Durvalumab) significantly improved overall survival (OS) versus sorafenib; 
      durvalumab monotherapy was noninferior to sorafenib for OS. Results reported 
      herein are from a 4-year updated OS analysis of HIMALAYA. PATIENTS AND METHODS: 
      Participants with uHCC and no previous systemic treatment were randomized to 
      STRIDE (n = 393), durvalumab (n = 389), or sorafenib (n = 389). The updated data 
      cut-off was 23 January 2023. OS and serious adverse events (AEs) were assessed. 
      Additionally, baseline characteristics and subsequent therapies were analyzed in 
      long-term survivors (≥36 months beyond randomization). RESULTS: For STRIDE, 
      durvalumab, and sorafenib, median [95% confidence interval (CI)] follow-up was 
      49.12 months (46.95-50.17 months), 48.46 months (46.82-49.81 months), and 47.31 
      months (45.08-49.15 months), respectively. OS hazard ratio (95% CI) for STRIDE 
      versus sorafenib was 0.78 (0.67-0.92). The 36-month OS rate for STRIDE was 30.7% 
      versus 19.8% for sorafenib. The 48-month OS rate remained higher for STRIDE at 
      25.2%, versus 15.1% for sorafenib. The long-term OS benefit of STRIDE was 
      observed across clinically relevant subgroups and was further improved in 
      participants who achieved disease control. Long-term survivors with STRIDE (n = 
      103) included participants across clinically relevant subgroups, and 57.3% 
      (59/103) had no reported subsequent anticancer therapy. No new serious 
      treatment-related AEs occurred with STRIDE from the primary analysis (17.5%; 
      68/388). Durvalumab maintained OS noninferiority to sorafenib and no late-onset 
      safety signals were identified. CONCLUSIONS: These data represent the longest 
      follow-up to date in phase III studies in uHCC. The unprecedented 3- and 4-year 
      OS rates reinforce the sustained long-term OS benefit of STRIDE versus sorafenib. 
      STRIDE maintained a tolerable yet differentiated safety profile from other 
      current uHCC therapies. Results continue to support the long-term benefits of 
      STRIDE in a diverse population, reflective of uHCC globally.

TI  - Camrelizumab plus rivoceranib versus sorafenib as first-line therapy for 
      unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (CARES-310): a randomised, open-label, 
      international phase 3 study.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Immunotherapy with immune checkpoint inhibitors combined with an 
      anti-angiogenic tyrosine-kinase inhibitor (TKI) has been shown to improve overall 
      survival versus anti-angiogenic therapy alone in advanced solid tumours, but not 
      in hepatocellular carcinoma. Therefore, a clinical study was conducted to compare 
      the efficacy and safety of the anti-PD-1 antibody camrelizumab plus the 
      VEGFR2-targeted TKI rivoceranib (also known as apatinib) versus sorafenib as 
      first-line treatment for unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma. METHODS: This 
      randomised, open-label, international phase 3 trial (CARES-310) was done at 95 
      study sites across 13 countries and regions worldwide. Patients with unresectable 
      or metastatic hepatocellular carcinoma who had not previously received any 
      systemic treatment were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive either camrelizumab 
      200 mg intravenously every 2 weeks plus rivoceranib 250 mg orally once daily or 
      sorafenib 400 mg orally twice daily. Randomisation was done via a centralised 
      interactive response system. The primary endpoints were progression-free 
      survival, as assessed by the blinded independent review committee per Response 
      Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumours version 1.1, and overall survival in the 
      intention-to-treat population. Safety was assessed in all patients who received 
      at least one dose of the study drugs. We report the findings from the 
      prespecified primary analysis for progression-free survival and interim analysis 
      for overall survival. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov 
      (NCT03764293). FINDINGS: Between June 28, 2019, and March 24, 2021, 543 patients 
      were randomly assigned to the camrelizumab-rivoceranib (n=272) or sorafenib 
      (n=271) group. At the primary analysis for progression-free survival (May 10, 
      2021), median follow-up was 7·8 months (IQR 4·1-10·6). Median progression-free 
      survival was significantly improved with camrelizumab-rivoceranib versus 
      sorafenib (5·6 months [95% CI 5·5-6·3] vs 3·7 months [2·8-3·7]; hazard ratio [HR] 
      0·52 [95% CI 0·41-0·65]; one-sided p<0·0001). At the interim analysis for overall 
      survival (Feb 8, 2022), median follow-up was 14·5 months (IQR 9·1-18·7). Median 
      overall survival was significantly extended with camrelizumab-rivoceranib versus 
      sorafenib (22·1 months [95% CI 19·1-27·2] vs 15·2 months [13·0-18·5]; HR 0·62 
      [95% CI 0·49-0·80]; one-sided p<0·0001). The most common grade 3 or 4 
      treatment-related adverse events were hypertension (102 [38%] of 272 patients in 
      the camrelizumab-rivoceranib group vs 40 [15%] of 269 patients in the sorafenib 
      group), palmar-plantar erythrodysaesthesia syndrome (33 [12%] vs 41 [15%]), 
      increased aspartate aminotransferase (45 [17%] vs 14 [5%]), and increased alanine 
      aminotransferase (35 [13%] vs eight [3%]). Treatment-related serious adverse 
      events were reported in 66 (24%) patients in the camrelizumab-rivoceranib group 
      and 16 (6%) in the sorafenib group. Treatment-related death occurred in two 
      patients: one patient in the camrelizumab-rivoceranib group (ie, multiple organ 
      dysfunction syndrome) and one patient in the sorafenib group (ie, respiratory 
      failure and circulatory collapse). INTERPRETATION: Camrelizumab plus rivoceranib 
      showed a statistically significant and clinically meaningful benefit in 
      progression-free survival and overall survival compared with sorafenib for 
      patients with unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma, presenting as a new and 
      effective first-line treatment option for this population. FUNDING: Jiangsu

AB  - Hepatic arterial infusion chemotherapy (HAIC) using a combination of oxaliplatin, 
      fluorouracil, and leucovorin (FOLFOX) has shown promise for hepatocellular 
      carcinoma (HCC) patients classified under Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC) 
      stage C. In China, the combined therapy of camrelizumab and apatinib is now an 
      approved first-line approach for inoperable HCC. This study (NCT04191889) 
      evaluated the benefit of combining camrelizumab and apatinib with HAIC-FOLFOX for 
      HCC patients in BCLC stage C. Eligible patients were given a maximum of six 
      cycles of HAIC-FOLFOX, along with camrelizumab and apatinib, until either disease 
      progression or intolerable toxicities emerged. The primary outcome measured was 
      the objective response rate (ORR) based on the Response Evaluation Criteria in 
      Solid Tumors (RECIST) v1.1. Thirty-five patients were enrolled. Based on RECIST 
      v1.1 criteria, the confirmed ORR stood at 77.1% (95% CI: 59.9% to 89.6%), with a 
      disease control rate of 97.1% (95% CI: 85.1% to 99.9%). The median 
      progression-free survival was 10.38 months (95% CI: 7.79 to 12.45). Patient 
      quality of life had a transient deterioration within four cycles of treatment, 
      and generally recovered thereafter. The most frequent grade ≥3 or above 
      treatment-related adverse events included reduced lymphocyte count (37.1%) and 
      diminished neutrophil count (34.3%). The combination of camrelizumab, apatinib, 
      and HAIC demonstrated encouraging results and manageable safety concerns for HCC 
      at BCLC stage C.

TI  - Tislelizumab vs Sorafenib as First-Line Treatment for Unresectable Hepatocellular 
      Carcinoma: A Phase 3 Randomized Clinical Trial.
PG  - 1651-1659
LID - 10.1001/jamaoncol.2023.4003 [doi]
AB  - IMPORTANCE: Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a leading cause of cancer-related 
      mortality, and additional first-line treatments are needed. The programmed cell 
      death protein 1 inhibitor tislelizumab demonstrated efficacy and a tolerable 
      safety profile as second-line HCC treatment. OBJECTIVE: To investigate efficacy 
      and safety of tislelizumab vs sorafenib tosylate for first-line treatment of 
      unresectable HCC. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: The open-label, global, 
      multiregional phase 3 RATIONALE-301 randomized clinical trial enrolled systemic 
      therapy-naive adults with histologically confirmed HCC, Barcelona Clinic Liver 
      Cancer stage B or C disease, disease progression following (or patient was not 
      amenable to) locoregional therapy, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance 
      status of 1 or less, and Child-Pugh class A, between December 27, 2017, and 
      October 2, 2019. Data cutoff was July 11, 2022. INTERVENTION: Patients were 
      randomized 1:1 to receive tislelizumab, 200 mg intravenously every 3 weeks, or 
      sorafenib tosylate, 400 mg orally twice daily. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The 
      primary end point was overall survival (OS); secondary end points included 
      objective response rate, progression-free survival, duration of response, and 
      safety. RESULTS: A total of 674 patients were included in the analysis (570 men 
      [84.6%]; median age, 61 years [range, 23-86 years]). As of July 11, 2022, minimum 
      study follow-up was 33 months. The primary end point of OS noninferiority of 
      tislelizumab vs sorafenib was met in the intention-to-treat population (n = 674); 
      median overall survival was 15.9 (95% CI, 13.2-19.7) months vs 14.1 (95% CI, 
      12.6-17.4) months, respectively (hazard ratio [HR], 0.85 [95.003% CI, 
      0.71-1.02]), and superiority of tislelizumab vs sorafenib was not met. The 
      objective response rate was 14.3% (n = 49) for tislelizumab vs 5.4% (n = 18) for 
      sorafenib, and median duration of response was 36.1 (95% CI, 16.8 to not 
      evaluable) months vs 11.0 (95% CI, 6.2-14.7) months, respectively. Median 
      progression-free survival was 2.1 (95% CI, 2.1-3.5) months vs 3.4 (95% CI, 
      2.2-4.1) months with tislelizumab vs sorafenib (HR, 1.11 [95% CI, 0.92-1.33]). 
      The incidence of treatment-emergent adverse events (AEs) was 96.2% (325 of 338 
      patients) for tislelizumab and 100% (n = 324) for sorafenib. Grade 3 or greater 
      treatment-related AEs were reported in 75 patients (22.2%) receiving tislelizumab 
      and 173 (53.4%) receiving sorafenib. There was a lower incidence of 
      treatment-related AEs leading to drug discontinuation (21 [6.2%] vs 33 [10.2%]) 
      and drug modification (68 [20.1%] vs 187 [57.7%]) with tislelizumab vs sorafenib. 
      CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In RATIONALE-301, tislelizumab demonstrated OS benefit 
      that was noninferior vs sorafenib, with a higher objective response rate and more 
      durable responses, while median progression-free survival was longer with 
      sorafenib. Tislelizumab demonstrated a favorable safety profile vs sorafenib.

TI  - Association between Liver MRI Proton Density Fat Fraction and Liver Disease Risk.
PG  - e231007
LID - 10.1148/radiol.231007 [doi]
AB  - Background A better understanding of the association between liver MRI proton 
      density fat fraction (PDFF) and liver diseases might support the clinical 
      implementation of MRI PDFF. Purpose To quantify the genetically predicted causal 
      effect of liver MRI PDFF on liver disease risk. Materials and Methods This 
      population-based prospective observational study used summary-level data mainly 
      from the UK Biobank and FinnGen. Mendelian randomization analysis was conducted 
      using the inverse variance-weighted method to explore the causal association 
      between genetically predicted liver MRI PDFF and liver disease risk with 
      Bonferroni correction. The individual-level data were downloaded between August 
      and December 2020 from the UK Biobank. Logistic regression analysis was performed 
      to validate the association between liver MRI PDFF polygenic risk score and liver 
      disease risk. Mediation analyses were performed using multivariable mendelian 
      randomization. Results Summary-level and individual-level data were obtained from 
      32 858 participants and 378 436 participants (mean age, 57 years ± 8 [SD]; 
      203 108 female participants), respectively. Genetically predicted high liver MRI 
      PDFF was associated with increased risks of malignant liver neoplasm (odds ratio 
      [OR], 4.5; P < .001), alcoholic liver disease (OR, 1.9; P < .001), fibrosis and 
      cirrhosis of the liver (OR, 3.0; P < .004), fibrosis of the liver (OR, 3.6; P = 
      .002), cirrhosis of the liver (OR, 3.8; P < .001), nonalcoholic steatohepatitis 
      (OR, 7.7; P < .001), and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) (OR, 4.4; P < 
      .001). Individual-level evidence supported these associations after grouping 
      participants based on liver MRI PDFF polygenic risk score (all P < .004). The 
      mediation analysis indicated that genetically predicted high-density lipoprotein 
      cholesterol, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and waist-to-hip ratio (mediation effects, 
      25.1%-46.3%) were related to the occurrence of fibrosis and cirrhosis of the 
      liver, cirrhosis of the liver, and NAFLD at liver MRI PDFF (all P < .05). 
      Conclusion This study provided evidence of the association between genetically 
      predicted liver MRI PDFF and liver health. © RSNA, 2023 Supplemental material is

TI  - Exposure-Response Analyses of Tremelimumab Monotherapy or in Combination with 
      Durvalumab in Patients with Unresectable Hepatocellular Carcinoma.
PG  - 754-763
LID - 10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-22-1983 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: A novel single-dose regimen of 300 mg tremelimumab in combination with 
      durvalumab [Single Tremelimumab Regular Interval Durvalumab (STRIDE)] has 
      demonstrated a favorable benefit-risk profile in the phase I/II Study 22 
      (NCT02519348) and phase III HIMALAYA study (NCT03298451). This study evaluated 
      the pharmacokinetics, exposure-response, and exposure-pharmacodynamics 
      relationships of tremelimumab in patients with unresectable hepatocellular 
      carcinoma (uHCC). PATIENTS AND METHODS: A previous tremelimumab population 
      pharmacokinetic model was validated using data from parts 2 and 3 of Study 22. 
      Exposure-response analyses explored relationships of tremelimumab exposure with 
      efficacy and safety. Pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics relationships were 
      evaluated using linear and nonlinear regression models. RESULTS: The observed 
      pharmacokinetics of tremelimumab in uHCC were consistent with predictions; no 
      significant covariates were identified. Tremelimumab exposure was not 
      significantly associated with adverse events, objective response rate, or 
      progression-free survival. Overall survival (OS) was longer for patients with 
      tremelimumab exposure, minimum serum drug concentration (Cmin1) ≥ median versus 
      Cmin1 < median (18.99 months vs. 10.97 months), but this exposure-survival 
      analysis might be confounded with baseline characteristics of albumin level and 
      neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio, which had a significant impact on OS (P = 0.0004 
      and 0.0001, respectively). The predicted Cmin1 of tremelimumab in STRIDE regimen 
      (12.9 μg/mL) was greater than the estimated concentration of tremelimumab 
      eliciting half-maximal increases (EC50 = 5.24 μg/mL) in CD8+Ki67+ T-cell counts. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Our findings support novel insights into tremelimumab 
      pharmacokinetics and exposure-response relationships in HCC and support the 
      clinical utility of the STRIDE regimen in patients with uHCC.

TI  - Lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab versus lenvatinib plus placebo for advanced 
      hepatocellular carcinoma (LEAP-002): a randomised, double-blind, phase 3 trial.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Systemic therapies have improved the management of hepatocellular 
      carcinoma, but there is still a need to further enhance overall survival in 
      first-line advanced stages. This study aimed to evaluate the addition of 
      pembrolizumab to lenvatinib versus lenvatinib plus placebo in the first-line 
      setting for unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma. METHODS: In this global, 
      randomised, double-blind, phase 3 study (LEAP-002), patients aged 18 years or 
      older with unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma, Child Pugh class A liver 
      disease, an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0 or 1, and 
      no previous systemic treatment were enrolled at 172 global sites. Patients were 
      randomly assigned (1:1) with a central interactive voice-response system (block 
      size of 4) to receive lenvatinib (bodyweight <60 kg, 8 mg/day; bodyweight ≥60 kg, 
      12 mg/day) plus pembrolizumab (200 mg every 3 weeks) or lenvatinib plus placebo. 
      Randomisation was stratified by geographical region, macrovascular portal vein 
      invasion or extrahepatic spread or both, α-fetoprotein concentration, and Eastern 
      Cooperative Oncology Group performance status. Dual primary endpoints were 
      overall survival (superiority threshold at final overall survival analysis, 
      one-sided p=0·019; final analysis to occur after 532 events) and progression-free 
      survival (superiority threshold one-sided p=0·002; final analysis to occur after 
      571 events) in the intention-to-treat population. Results from the final analysis 
      are reported. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03713593, and 
      is active but not recruiting. FINDINGS: Between Jan 17, 2019, and April 28, 2020, 
      of 1309 patients assessed, 794 were randomly assigned to lenvatinib plus 
      pembrolizumab (n=395) or lenvatinib plus placebo (n=399). Median age was 66·0 
      years (IQR 57·0-72·0), 644 (81%) of 794 were male, 150 (19%) were female, 345 
      (43%) were Asian, 345 (43%) were White, 22 (3%) were multiple races, 21 (3%) were 
      American Indian or Alaska Native, 21 (3%) were Native Hawaiian or other Pacific 
      Islander, 13 (2%) were Black or African American, and 46 (6%) did not have 
      available race data. Median follow up as of data cutoff for the final analysis 
      (June 21, 2022) was 32·1 months (IQR 29·4-35·3). Median overall survival was 21·2 
      months (95% CI 19·0-23·6; 252 [64%] of 395 died) with lenvatinib plus 
      pembrolizumab versus 19·0 months (17·2-21·7; 282 [71%] of 399 died) with 
      lenvatinib plus placebo (hazard ratio [HR] 0·84; 95% CI 0·71-1·00; stratified 
      log-rank p=0·023). As of data cutoff for the progression-free survival final 
      analysis (April 5, 2021), median progression-free survival was 8·2 months (95% CI 
      6·4-8·4; 270 events occurred [42 deaths; 228 progressions]) with lenvatinib plus 
      pembrolizumab versus 8·0 months (6·3-8·2; 301 events occurred [36 deaths; 265 
      progressions]) with lenvatinib plus placebo (HR 0·87; 95% CI 0·73-1·02; 
      stratified log-rank p=0·047). The most common treatment-related grade 3-4 adverse 
      events were hypertension (69 [17%] of 395 patients in the lenvatinib plus 
      pembrolizumab group vs 68 [17%] of 395 patients) in the lenvatinib plus placebo 
      group), increased aspartate aminotransferase (27 [7%] vs 17 [4%]), and diarrhoea 
      (25 [6%] vs 15 [4%]). Treatment-related deaths occurred in four (1%) patients in 
      the lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab group (due to gastrointestinal haemorrhage and 
      hepatorenal syndrome [n=1 each] and hepatic encephalopathy [n=2]) and in three 
      (1%) patients in the lenvatinib plus placebo group (due to gastrointestinal 
      haemorrhage, hepatorenal syndrome, and cerebrovascular accident [n=1 each]). 
      INTERPRETATION: In earlier studies, the addition of pembrolizumab to lenvatinib 
      as first-line therapy for advanced hepatocellular carcinoma has shown promising 
      clinical activity; however, lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab did not meet 
      prespecified significance for improved overall survival and progression-free 
      survival versus lenvatinib plus placebo. Our findings do not support a change in 
      clinical practice. FUNDING: Eisai US, and Merck Sharp & Dohme, a subsidiary of

TI  - Aspirin for Metabolic Dysfunction-Associated Steatotic Liver Disease Without 
      Cirrhosis: A Randomized Clinical Trial.
PG  - 920-929
LID - 10.1001/jama.2024.1215 [doi]
AB  - IMPORTANCE: Aspirin may reduce severity of metabolic dysfunction-associated 
      steatotic liver disease (MASLD) and lower the incidence of end-stage liver 
      disease and hepatocellular carcinoma, in patients with MASLD. However, the effect 
      of aspirin on MASLD is unknown. OBJECTIVE: To test whether low-dose aspirin 
      reduces liver fat content, compared with placebo, in adults with MASLD. DESIGN, 
      SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This 6-month, phase 2, randomized, double-blind, 
      placebo-controlled clinical trial was conducted at a single hospital in Boston, 
      Massachusetts. Participants were aged 18 to 70 years with established MASLD 
      without cirrhosis. Enrollment occurred between August 20, 2019, and July 19, 
      2022, with final follow-up on February 23, 2023. INTERVENTIONS: Participants were 
      randomized (1:1) to receive either once-daily aspirin, 81 mg (n = 40) or 
      identical placebo pills (n = 40) for 6 months. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The 
      primary end point was mean absolute change in hepatic fat content, measured by 
      proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) at 6-month follow-up. The 4 key 
      secondary outcomes included mean percentage change in hepatic fat content by MRS, 
      the proportion achieving at least 30% reduction in hepatic fat, and the mean 
      absolute and relative reductions in hepatic fat content, measured by magnetic 
      resonance imaging proton density fat fraction (MRI-PDFF). Analyses adjusted for 
      the baseline value of the corresponding outcome. Minimal clinically important 
      differences for study outcomes were not prespecified. RESULTS: Among 80 
      randomized participants (mean age, 48 years; 44 [55%] women; mean hepatic fat 
      content, 35% [indicating moderate steatosis]), 71 (89%) completed 6-month 
      follow-up. The mean absolute change in hepatic fat content by MRS was -6.6% with 
      aspirin vs 3.6% with placebo (difference, -10.2% [95% CI, -27.7% to -2.6%]; 
      P = .009). Compared with placebo, aspirin treatment significantly reduced 
      relative hepatic fat content (-8.8 vs 30.0 percentage points; mean difference, 
      -38.8 percentage points [95% CI, -66.7 to -10.8]; P = .007), increased the 
      proportion of patients with 30% or greater relative reduction in hepatic fat 
      (42.5% vs 12.5%; mean difference, 30.0% [95% CI, 11.6% to 48.4%]; P = .006), 
      reduced absolute hepatic fat content by MRI-PDFF (-2.7% vs 0.9%; mean difference, 
      -3.7% [95% CI, -6.1% to -1.2%]; P = .004]), and reduced relative hepatic fat 
      content by MRI-PDFF (-11.7 vs 15.7 percentage points; mean difference, -27.3 
      percentage points [95% CI, -45.2 to -9.4]; P = .003). Thirteen participants 
      (32.5%) in each group experienced an adverse event, most commonly upper 
      respiratory tract infections (10.0% in each group) or arthralgias (5.0% for 
      aspirin vs 7.5% for placebo). One participant randomized to aspirin (2.5%) 
      experienced drug-related heartburn. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this 
      preliminary randomized clinical trial of patients with MASLD, 6 months of daily 
      low-dose aspirin significantly reduced hepatic fat quantity compared with 
      placebo. Further study in a larger sample size is necessary to confirm these 
      findings. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT04031729.

TI  - Laparoscopic liver resection versus radiofrequency ablation for small 
      hepatocellular carcinoma: randomized clinical trial.
LID - znae099 [pii]
LID - 10.1093/bjs/znae099 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to compare the efficacy of laparoscopic 
      liver resection versus radiofrequency ablation for treatment of small 
      hepatocellular carcinoma. METHODS: This single-centre RCT was conducted at a 
      tertiary referral centre in China. Patients with small hepatocellular carcinoma 
      who had a single nodule no larger than 5 cm, or up to three nodules of 3 cm or 
      smaller, were eligible. Patients were assigned randomly in a 1 : 1 ratio to 
      either laparoscopic liver resection or radiofrequency ablation. Blinding was not 
      attempted. Sample size calculations led to 75 patients per group. The primary 
      outcome was overall survival, and the secondary outcome was recurrence-free 
      survival. RESULTS: Seventy-five patients were included in each group. Overall 
      survival (HR 1.26, 95% c.i. 0.69 to 2.30; P = 0.451) and recurrence-free survival 
      (HR 1.34, 0.86 to 2.08; P = 0.189) did not differ between the resection and 
      ablation groups. The 1-, 3- and 5-year overall survival rates were 94.7, 80.0, 
      and 74.7% respectively after laparoscopic liver resection versus 93.3, 78.7, and 
      67.9% after radiofrequency ablation. Corresponding recurrence-free survival rates 
      were 78.7, 61.3, and 51.6%, and 69.3, 53.3, and 41.0%, respectively. CONCLUSION: 
      For small hepatocellular carcinoma, percutaneous radiofrequency ablation provides 
      therapeutic effects similar to those of laparoscopic liver resection.

OAB - Percutaneous radiofrequency ablation may provide similar therapeutic effects to 
      laparoscopic liver resection for patients with small hepatocellular carcinoma. 
      This study compared the two treatments. Survival was similar after the two 
      treatments. The choice of treatment may depend on the patient’s preference and 
      local availability.

TI  - Lenvatinib Combined With Transarterial Chemoembolization as First-Line Treatment 
      for Advanced Hepatocellular Carcinoma: A Phase III, Randomized Clinical Trial 
      (LAUNCH).
PG  - 117-127
LID - 10.1200/JCO.22.00392 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Lenvatinib (LEN) is a first-line therapy for patients with advanced 
      hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC); however, it has shown modest survival benefits. 
      Therefore, we aimed to compare clinical outcomes of LEN combined with 
      transarterial chemoembolization (LEN-TACE) versus LEN monotherapy in patients 
      with advanced HCC. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This was a multicenter, randomized, 
      open-label, parallel group, phase III trial. Patients with primary 
      treatment-naive or initial recurrent advanced HCC after surgery were randomly 
      assigned (1:1) to receive LEN plus on-demand TACE (LEN-TACE) or LEN monotherapy. 
      LEN was initiated within 3 days after random assignment (initial dose: 12 mg once 
      daily for patients ≥ 60 kg; 8 mg once daily for patients < 60 kg). TACE was 
      initiated one day after LEN initiation. The primary end point was overall 
      survival (OS). RESULTS: Between June 2019 and July 2021, a total of 338 patients 
      underwent random assignment at 12 centers in China: 170 to LEN-TACE and 168 to 
      LEN. At a prespecified event-driven interim analysis after a median follow-up of 
      17.0 months, the median OS was significantly longer in the LEN-TACE group (17.8 v 
      11.5 months; hazard ratio, 0.45; P < .001). The median progression-free survival 
      was 10.6 months in the LEN-TACE group and 6.4 months in the LEN group (hazard 
      ratio, 0.43; P < .001). Patients in the LEN-TACE group had a higher objective 
      response rate according to the modified RECIST (54.1% v 25.0%, P < .001). 
      Multivariable analysis revealed that portal vein tumor thrombus and treatment 
      allocation were independent risk factors for OS. CONCLUSION: The addition of TACE 
      to LEN improves clinical outcomes and is a potential first-line treatment for 
      patients with advanced HCC.

AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: Current hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) risk scores do not 
      reflect changes in HCC risk resulting from liver disease progression/regression 
      over time. We aimed to develop and validate two novel prediction models using 
      multivariate longitudinal data, with or without cell-free DNA (cfDNA) signatures. 
      METHODS: A total of 13,728 patients from two nationwide multicenter prospective 
      observational cohorts, the majority of whom had chronic hepatitis B, were 
      enrolled. aMAP score, as one of the most promising HCC prediction models, was 
      evaluated for each patient. Low-pass whole-genome sequencing was used to derive 
      multi-modal cfDNA fragmentomics features. A longitudinal discriminant analysis 
      algorithm was used to model longitudinal profiles of patient biomarkers and 
      estimate the risk of HCC development. RESULTS: We developed and externally 
      validated two novel HCC prediction models with a greater accuracy, termed aMAP-2 
      and aMAP-2 Plus scores. The aMAP-2 score, calculated with longitudinal data on 
      the aMAP score and alpha-fetoprotein values during an up to 8-year follow-up, 
      performed superbly in the training and external validation cohorts (AUC 
      0.83-0.84). The aMAP-2 score showed further improvement and accurately divided 
      aMAP-defined high-risk patients into two groups with 5-year cumulative HCC 
      incidences of 23.4% and 4.1%, respectively (p = 0.0065). The aMAP-2 Plus score, 
      which incorporates cfDNA signatures (nucleosome, fragment and motif scores), 
      optimized the prediction of HCC development, especially for patients with 
      cirrhosis (AUC 0.85-0.89). Importantly, the stepwise approach (aMAP -> aMAP-2 -> 
      aMAP-2 Plus) stratified patients with cirrhosis into two groups, comprising 90% 
      and 10% of the cohort, with an annual HCC incidence of 0.8% and 12.5%, 
      respectively (p <0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: aMAP-2 and aMAP-2 Plus scores are highly 
      accurate in predicting HCC. The stepwise application of aMAP scores provides an 
      improved enrichment strategy, identifying patients at a high risk of HCC, which 
      could effectively guide individualized HCC surveillance. IMPACT AND IMPLICATIONS: 
      In this multicenter nationwide cohort study, we developed and externally 
      validated two novel hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) risk prediction models (called 
      aMAP-2 and aMAP-2 Plus scores), using longitudinal discriminant analysis 
      algorithm and longitudinal data (i.e., aMAP and alpha-fetoprotein) with or 
      without the addition of cell-free DNA signatures, based on 13,728 patients from 
      61 centers across mainland China. Our findings demonstrated that the performance 
      of aMAP-2 and aMAP-2 Plus scores was markedly better than the original aMAP 
      score, and any other existing HCC risk scores across all subsets, especially for 
      patients with cirrhosis. More importantly, the stepwise application of aMAP 
      scores (aMAP -> aMAP-2 -> aMAP-2 Plus) provides an improved enrichment strategy, 
      identifying patients at high risk of HCC, which could effectively guide 
      individualized HCC surveillance.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Autoimmune hepatitis (AIH) is a rare chronic liver disease 
      of unknown aetiology; the risk of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remains unclear 
      and risk factors are not well-defined. We aimed to investigate the risk of HCC 
      across a multicentre AIH cohort and to identify predictive factors. METHODS: We 
      performed a retrospective, observational, multicentric study of patients included 
      in the International Autoimmune Hepatitis Group Retrospective Registry. The 
      assessed clinical outcomes were HCC development, liver transplantation, and 
      death. Fine and Gray regression analysis stratified by centre was applied to 
      determine the effects of individual covariates; the cumulative incidence of HCC 
      was estimated using the competing risk method with death as a competing risk. 
      RESULTS: A total of 1,428 patients diagnosed with AIH from 1980 to 2020 from 22 
      eligible centres across Europe and Canada were included, with a median follow-up 
      of 11.1 years (interquartile range 5.2-15.9). Two hundred and ninety-three 
      (20.5%) patients had cirrhosis at diagnosis. During follow-up, 24 patients 
      developed HCC (1.7%), an incidence rate of 1.44 cases/1,000 patient-years; the 
      cumulative incidence of HCC increased over time (0.6% at 5 years, 0.9% at 10 
      years, 2.7% at 20 years, and 6.6% at 30 years of follow-up). Patients who 
      developed cirrhosis during follow-up had a significantly higher incidence of HCC. 
      The cumulative incidence of HCC was 2.6%, 4.6%, 5.6% and 6.6% at 5, 10, 15, and 
      20 years after the development of cirrhosis, respectively. Obesity (hazard ratio 
      [HR] 2.94, p = 0.04), cirrhosis (HR 3.17, p = 0.01), and AIH/PSC variant syndrome 
      (HR 5.18, p = 0.007) at baseline were independent risk factors for HCC 
      development. CONCLUSIONS: HCC incidence in AIH is low even after cirrhosis 
      development and is associated with risk factors including obesity, cirrhosis, and 
      AIH/PSC variant syndrome. IMPACT AND IMPLICATIONS: The risk of developing 
      hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in individuals with autoimmune hepatitis (AIH) 
      seems to be lower than for other aetiologies of chronic liver disease. Yet, solid 
      data for this specific patient group remain elusive, given that most of the 
      existing evidence comes from small, single-centre studies. In our study, we found 
      that HCC incidence in patients with AIH is low even after the onset of cirrhosis. 
      Additionally, factors such as advanced age, obesity, cirrhosis, alcohol 
      consumption, and the presence of the AIH/PSC variant syndrome at the time of AIH 
      diagnosis are linked to a higher risk of HCC. Based on these findings, there 
      seems to be merit in adopting a specialized HCC monitoring programme for patients 
      with AIH based on their individual risk factors.

TI  - Postoperative Adjuvant Hepatic Arterial Infusion Chemotherapy With FOLFOX in 
      Hepatocellular Carcinoma With Microvascular Invasion: A Multicenter, Phase III, 
      Randomized Study.
PG  - 1898-1908
LID - 10.1200/JCO.22.01142 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: To report the efficacy and safety of postoperative adjuvant hepatic 
      arterial infusion chemotherapy (HAIC) with 5-fluorouracil and oxaliplatin 
      (FOLFOX) in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients with microvascular invasion 
      (MVI). PATIENTS AND METHODS: In this randomized, open-label, multicenter trial, 
      histologically confirmed HCC patients with MVI were randomly assigned (1:1) to 
      receive adjuvant FOLFOX-HAIC (treatment group) or routine follow-up (control 
      group). The primary end point was disease-free survival (DFS) by 
      intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis while secondary end points were overall 
      survival, recurrence rate, and safety. RESULTS: Between June 2016 and August 
      2021, a total of 315 patients (ITT population) at five centers were randomly 
      assigned to the treatment group (n = 157) or the control group (n = 158). In the 
      ITT population, the median DFS was 20.3 months (95% CI, 10.4 to 30.3) in the 
      treatment group versus 10.0 months (95% CI, 6.8 to 13.2) in the control group 
      (hazard ratio, 0.59; 95% CI, 0.43 to 0.81; P = .001). The overall survival rates 
      at 1 year, 2 years, and 3 years were 93.8% (95% CI, 89.8 to 98.1), 86.4% (95% CI, 
      80.0 to 93.2), and 80.4% (95% CI, 71.9 to 89.9) for the treatment group and 92.0% 
      (95% CI, 87.6 to 96.7), 86.0% (95% CI, 79.9 to 92.6), and 74.9% (95% CI, 65.5 to 
      85.7) for the control group (hazard ratio, 0.64; 95% CI, 0.36 to 1.14; P = .130), 
      respectively. The recurrence rates were 40.1% (63/157) in the treatment group and 
      55.7% (88/158) in the control group. Majority of the adverse events were grade 
      0-1 (83.8%), with no treatment-related death in both groups. CONCLUSION: 
      Postoperative adjuvant HAIC with FOLFOX significantly improved the DFS benefits 
      with acceptable toxicities in HCC patients with MVI.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Immune checkpoint inhibitors targeting PD-1 or CTLA-4 individually 
      have shown substantial clinical benefits in the treatment of malignancies. We 
      aimed to assess the safety and antitumour activity of cadonilimab monotherapy, a 
      bispecific PD-1/CTLA-4 antibody, in patients with advanced solid tumours. 
      METHODS: This multicentre, open-label, phase 1b/2 trial was conducted across 30 
      hospitals in China. Patients aged 18 years or older with histologically or 
      cytologically confirmed, unresectable advanced solid tumours, unsuccessful 
      completion of at least one previous systemic therapy, and an Eastern Cooperative 
      Oncology Group performance status of 0 or 1 were eligible for inclusion. Patients 
      who had previously received anti-PD-1, anti-PD-L1, or anti-CTLA-4 treatment were 
      not eligible for inclusion. In the dose escalation phase of phase 1b, patients 
      received intravenous cadonilimab at 6 mg/kg and 10 mg/kg every 2 weeks. In the 
      dose expansion phase of phase 1b, cadonilimab at 6 mg/kg and a fixed dose of 
      450 mg were given intravenously every 2 weeks. In phase 2, cadonilimab at 6 mg/kg 
      was administered intravenously every 2 weeks in three cohorts: patients with 
      cervical cancer, oesophageal squamous cell carcinoma, and hepatocellular 
      carcinoma. The primary endpoints were the safety of cadonilimab in phase 1b and 
      objective response rate in phase 2, based on the Response Evaluation Criteria in 
      Solid Tumors (RECIST), version 1.1. The safety analysis was done in all patients 
      who received at least one dose of cadonilimab. Antitumour activity was assessed 
      in the full analysis set for the cervical cancer cohort, and in all patients with 
      measurable disease at baseline and who received at least one dose of cadonilimab 
      in the oesophageal squamous cell carcinoma and hepatocellular carcinoma cohorts. 
      The study is registered on ClinicalTrial.gov, NCT03852251, and closed to new 
      participants; follow-up has been completed. FINDINGS: Between Jan 18, 2019, and 
      Jan 8, 2021, 240 patients (83 [43 male and 40 female] in phase 1b and 157 in 
      phase 2) were enrolled. Phase 2 enrolled 111 female patients with cervical 
      cancer, 22 patients with oesophageal squamous cell carcinoma (15 male and seven 
      female), and 24 patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (17 male and seven 
      female). During dose escalation, no dose-limiting toxicities occurred. Grade 3-4 
      treatment-related adverse events occurred in 67 (28%) of 240 patients; the most 
      frequent grade 3 or worse treatment-related adverse events were anaemia (seven 
      [3%]), increased lipase (four [2%]), decreased bodyweight (three [1%]), decreased 
      appetite (four [2%]), decreased neutrophil count (three [1%]), and 
      infusion-related reaction (two [1%]). 17 (7%) patients discontinued treatment due 
      to treatment-related adverse events. 54 (23%) of 240 patients reported serious 
      treatment-related adverse events, including five patients who died (one due to 
      myocardial infarction; cause unknown for four). In phase 2, in the cervical 
      cancer cohort, with a median follow-up of 14·6 months (IQR 13·1-17·5), the 
      objective response rate was 32·3% (32 of 99; 95% CI 23·3-42·5). In the 
      oesophageal squamous cell carcinoma cohort, with a median follow-up of 17·9 
      months (IQR 4·0-15·1), the objective response rate was 18·2% (four of 22; 95% CI 
      5·2-40·3). In the hepatocellular carcinoma cohort, with a median follow-up of 
      19·6 months (IQR 8·7-19·8), the objective response rate was 16·7% (four of 24; 
      95% CI 4·7-37·4). INTERPRETATION: Cadonilimab showed an encouraging tumour 
      response rate, with a manageable safety profile, suggesting the potential of 
      cadonilimab for the treatment of advanced solid tumours. FUNDING: Akeso

TI  - Lenvatinib plus anti-PD-1 antibodies as conversion therapy for patients with 
      unresectable intermediate-advanced hepatocellular carcinoma: a single-arm, phase 
      II trial.
LID - 10.1136/jitc-2023-007366 [doi]
LID - e007366
AB  - BACKGROUND: Over 70% of the patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) are 
      diagnosed at an advanced stage and lose the opportunity for radical surgery. 
      Combination therapy of tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) and anti-programmed cell 
      death protein-1 (PD-1) antibodies has achieved a high tumor response rate in both 
      the first-line and second-line treatment of advanced HCC. However, few studies 
      have prospectively evaluated whether TKIs plus anti-PD-1 antibodies could convert 
      unresectable intermediate-advanced HCC into resectable disease. METHODS: This 
      single-arm, phase II study enrolled systemic therapy-naïve adult patients with 
      unresectable Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer stage B or C HCC. Patients received 
      oral lenvatinib one time per day plus intravenous anti-PD-1 agents every 3 weeks 
      (one cycle). Tumor response and resectability were evaluated before the fourth 
      cycle, then every two cycles. The primary endpoint was conversion success rate by 
      investigator assessment. Secondary endpoints included objective response rate 
      (ORR) by independent imaging review (IIR) assessment per modified RECIST 
      (mRECIST) and Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors, V.1.1 (RECIST 1.1), 
      progression-free survival (PFS) and 12-month recurrence-free survival (RFS) rate 
      by IIR per mRECIST, R0 resection rate, overall survival (OS), and safety. 
      Biomarkers were assessed as exploratory objectives. RESULTS: Of the 56 eligible 
      patients enrolled, 53 (94.6%) had macrovascular invasion, and 16 (28.6%) had 
      extrahepatic metastasis. The median follow-up was 23.5 months. The primary 
      endpoint showed a conversion success rate of 55.4% (31/56). ORR was 53.6% per 
      mRECIST and 44.6% per RECIST 1.1. Median PFS was 8.9 months, and median OS was 
      23.9 months. Among the 31 successful conversion patients, 21 underwent surgery 
      with an R0 resection rate of 85.7%, a pathological complete response rate of 
      38.1%, and a 12-month RFS rate of 47.6%. Grade ≥3 treatment-related adverse 
      events were observed in 42.9% of patients. Tumor immune microenvironment analysis 
      of pretreatment samples displayed significant enrichment of CD8(+) T cells 
      (p=0.03) in responders versus non-responders. CONCLUSION: Lenvatinib plus 
      anti-PD-1 antibodies demonstrate promising efficacy and tolerable safety as 
      conversion therapy in unresectable HCC. Pre-existing CD8(+) cells are identified 
      as a promising biomarker for response to this regimen. TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER:

AB  - BACKGROUND: The synergy between locoregional therapies and immune checkpoint 
      inhibitors has not been investigated as conversion therapy for unresectable 
      hepatocellular carcinoma. We aimed to investigate the activity of sequential 
      transarterial chemoembolisation (TACE) and stereotactic body radiotherapy 
      followed by avelumab (an anti-PD-L1 drug) for locally advanced, unresectable 
      hepatocellular carcinoma. METHODS: START-FIT was a single-arm, phase 2 trial in 
      patients with locally advanced hepatocellular carcinoma who were not suitable for 
      curative treatment, conducted in two hospitals in Hong Kong and one in Shenzhen, 
      China. Eligible patients were those aged 18 years or older with an Eastern 
      Cooperative Oncology Group performance status 0-1, Child-Pugh liver function 
      score A5 to B7, tumour size of at least 5 cm, a maximum of three tumour lesions, 
      and adequate hepatic, renal, and bone marrow function. Participants received TACE 
      on day 1, followed by stereotactic body radiotherapy (27·5-40·0 Gy in five 
      fractions) at day 28. Avelumab (10 mg/kg) was administered 14 days following 
      stereotactic body radiotherapy and every 2 weeks thereafter. The primary endpoint 
      was the proportion of patients deemed amenable to curative treatment, defined as 
      those who had a sustained complete or partial treatment response for at least 2 
      months and if curative treatment could be performed (ie, resection, 
      radiofrequency ablation, or transplantation), analysed by intention to treat. 
      Safety was also analysed in the intention-to-treat population. This trial is 
      registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT03817736) and has been completed. 
      FINDINGS: Between March 18, 2019, and Jan 27, 2021, 33 patients (32 [97%] men and 
      one [3%] woman) were enrolled. The median sum of the largest diameters of lesions 
      was 15·1 cm (IQR 8·3-14·9). 21 (64%) patients had macrovascular invasion (hepatic 
      vein [n=13], branched portal vein [n=3], or both [n=5]). Median follow-up was 
      17·2 months (IQR 7·8-25·8). 18 (55%) patients were deemed amenable to curative 
      treatment: four (12%) of 33 patients had curative treatment (resection [n=2] or 
      radiofrequency ablation [n=2]), and 14 (42%) had a radiological complete response 
      and opted for close surveillance. 11 (33%) of 33 patients had treatment-related 
      adverse events that were grade 3 or worse. The most common treatment-related 
      grade 3 or worse adverse event was transient increase in alanine aminotransferase 
      or aspartate aminotransferase (five [15%]) after TACE. Five (15%) patients 
      developed immune-related adverse events of grade 3 or worse (three had hepatitis, 
      two had dermatitis). INTERPRETATION: To our knowledge, this is the first 
      prospective trial using the combination of immunotherapy and locoregional 
      treatment as conversion therapy for locally advanced unresectable hepatocellular 
      carcinoma, with promising results. Future randomised trials with larger cohorts 
      of patients are warranted. FUNDING: Merck.

TI  - Pembrolizumab Versus Placebo as Second-Line Therapy in Patients From Asia With 
      Advanced Hepatocellular Carcinoma: A Randomized, Double-Blind, Phase III Trial.
PG  - 1434-1443
LID - 10.1200/JCO.22.00620 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: We evaluated the efficacy and safety of pembrolizumab in patients from 
      Asia with previously treated advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). METHODS: In 
      a double-blind, phase III trial, 453 patients with advanced HCC and progression 
      during or after treatment with or intolerance to sorafenib or oxaliplatin-based 
      chemotherapy were randomly assigned in a 2:1 ratio to receive pembrolizumab (200 
      mg) or placebo once every 3 weeks for ≤ 35 cycles plus best supportive care. The 
      primary end point was overall survival (one-sided significance threshold, P = 
      .0193 [final analysis]). Secondary end points included progression-free survival 
      (PFS) and objective response rate (ORR; one-sided significance threshold, P = 
      .0134 and .0091, respectively [second interim analysis]; RECIST version 1.1, by 
      blinded independent central review). RESULTS: Median overall survival was longer 
      in the pembrolizumab group than in the placebo group (14.6 v 13.0 months; hazard 
      ratio for death, 0.79; 95% CI, 0.63 to 0.99; P = .0180). Median PFS was also 
      longer in the pembrolizumab group than in the placebo group (2.6 v 2.3 months; 
      hazard ratio for progression or death, 0.74; 95% CI, 0.60 to 0.92; P = .0032). 
      ORR was greater in the pembrolizumab group (12.7% [95% CI, 9.1 to 17.0]) than in 
      the placebo group (1.3% [95% CI, 0.2 to 4.6]; P < .0001). Treatment-related 
      adverse events occurred in 66.9% of patients (grade 3, 12.0%; grade 4, 1.3%; 
      grade 5, 1.0%) in the pembrolizumab group and 49.7% of patients (grade 3, 5.9%; 
      grade 4, 0%; grade 5, 0%) in the placebo group. CONCLUSION: In patients from Asia 
      with previously treated advanced HCC, pembrolizumab significantly prolonged 
      overall survival and PFS, and ORR was greater versus placebo.

TI  - Outcomes of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma treated with atezolizumab plus 
      bevacizumab in real-world clinical practice who met or did not meet the inclusion 
      criteria for the phase 3 IMbrave150 trial.
PG  - 233-245
LID - 10.1111/apt.18037 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Atezolizumab plus bevacizumab (Atezo/Bev) is frequently selected as 
      the primary systemic therapy for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). AIMS: To 
      investigate the outcomes of patients with HCC treated with Atezo/Bev in a 
      real-world setting based on whether they met the inclusion criteria for the phase 
      3 IMbrave150 trial. METHODS: A total of 936 patients were enrolled. There were 
      404 patients who met the inclusion criteria of the phase 3 IMbrave150 trial 
      (IMbrave150 group) and 532 who did not (non-IMbrave150 group). RESULTS: Median 
      progression-free survival (PFS) in the IMbrave150 and non-IMbrave150 groups was 
      7.4 months and 5.6 months (p = 0.002). Multivariable analysis revealed that 
      non-B, non-C HCC aetiology (hazard ratio [HR], 1.173), α-fetoprotein ≥100 ng/mL 
      (HR, 1.472), Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer stage ≥ C (HR, 1.318), and modified 
      albumin-bilirubin (mALBI) grade 2b or 3 (HR, 1.476) are independently associated 
      with PFS. Median overall survival (OS) in the IMbrave150 and non-Imbrave150 
      groups was 26.5 and 18.8 months (p < 0.001). Multivariable analysis revealed that 
      Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status ≥2 (HR, 1.986), 
      α-fetoprotein ≥100 ng/mL (HR, 1.481), and mALBI grade 2b or 3 (HR, 2.037) are 
      independently associated with OS. In subgroup analysis, there were no significant 
      differences in PFS or OS between these groups among patients with mALBI grade 1 
      or 2a. CONCLUSIONS: Patients who are treated with Atezo/Bev and meet the 
      inclusion criteria for the phase 3 IMbrave150 trial, as well as those who do not 
      meet the inclusion criteria but have good liver function, have a good prognosis 
      for survival.

TI  - SAFFRON-104: a phase Ib/II study of sitravatinib alone or with tislelizumab in 
      advanced hepatocellular carcinoma and gastric cancer/gastroesophageal junction 
      cancer.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Sitravatinib is a spectrum-selective tyrosine kinase inhibitor 
      targeting TAM (TYRO3, AXL, MER), VEGFR-2, KIT, and MET. SAFFRON-104 (NCT03941873) 
      was a multicohort phase Ib/II study investigating sitravatinib with/without 
      tislelizumab, an anti-programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) antibody, in 
      patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) or gastric 
      cancer/gastroesophageal junction cancer (GC/GEJC). METHODS: Eligible patients had 
      histologically/cytologically confirmed advanced HCC or GC/GEJC. Phase I 
      determined the recommended phase II dose (RP2D) of sitravatinib with/without 
      tislelizumab. Phase II evaluated sitravatinib monotherapy in patients with 
      pretreated HCC, and sitravatinib plus tislelizumab in anti-PD-(L)1-naïve or 
      -treated HCC and anti-PD-(L)1-naïve GC/GEJC. Primary endpoints were 
      safety/tolerability (phase I) and objective response rate (ORR) (phase II). 
      RESULTS: At data cutoff (March 31, 2023), 111 patients were enrolled; 102 were 
      efficacy-evaluable (median study follow-up 9.1 months [range: 0.7-36.9]). The 
      RP2D of sitravatinib was determined as 120 mg orally once daily. In patients 
      receiving sitravatinib monotherapy and sitravatinib in combination with 
      tislelizumab, grade ≥ 3 treatment-related adverse events occurred in 14 (51.9%) 
      and 42 (50.0%) patients, respectively. The ORR was 25% (95% confidence interval 
      [CI]: 8.7-49.1) in patients with pretreated HCC receiving sitravatinib 
      monotherapy. In patients receiving sitravatinib with tislelizumab, the ORR was 
      11.5% (95% CI 2.4-30.2) with anti-PD-(L)1-naïve HCC, 9.5% (95% CI 1.2-30.4) with 
      anti-PD-(L)1-treated HCC, and 16.1% (95% CI 5.5-33.7) in patients with 
      anti-PD-(L)1-naïve GC/GEJC. CONCLUSIONS: Sitravatinib with/without tislelizumab 
      was generally well tolerated and showed preliminary antitumor activity in 
      patients with advanced HCC and GC/GEJC.

TI  - Personalized neoantigen vaccine and pembrolizumab in advanced hepatocellular 
      carcinoma: a phase 1/2 trial.
PG  - 1044-1053
LID - 10.1038/s41591-024-02894-y [doi]
AB  - Programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) inhibitors have modest efficacy as a 
      monotherapy in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). A personalized therapeutic cancer 
      vaccine (PTCV) may enhance responses to PD-1 inhibitors through the induction of 
      tumor-specific immunity. We present results from a single-arm, open-label, phase 
      1/2 study of a DNA plasmid PTCV (GNOS-PV02) encoding up to 40 neoantigens 
      coadministered with plasmid-encoded interleukin-12 plus pembrolizumab in patients 
      with advanced HCC previously treated with a multityrosine kinase inhibitor. 
      Safety and immunogenicity were assessed as primary endpoints, and treatment 
      efficacy and feasibility were evaluated as secondary endpoints. The most common 
      treatment-related adverse events were injection-site reactions, observed in 15 of 
      36 (41.6%) patients. No dose-limiting toxicities or treatment-related grade ≥3 
      events were observed. The objective response rate (modified intention-to-treat) 
      per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors 1.1 was 30.6% (11 of 36 
      patients), with 8.3% (3 of 36) of patients achieving a complete response. 
      Clinical responses were associated with the number of neoantigens encoded in the 
      vaccine. Neoantigen-specific T cell responses were confirmed in 19 of 22 (86.4%) 
      evaluable patients by enzyme-linked immunosorbent spot assays. Multiparametric 
      cellular profiling revealed active, proliferative and cytolytic vaccine-specific 
      CD4(+) and CD8(+) effector T cells. T cell receptor β-chain (TCRβ) bulk 
      sequencing results demonstrated vaccination-enriched T cell clone expansion and 
      tumor infiltration. Single-cell analysis revealed posttreatment T cell clonal 
      expansion of cytotoxic T cell phenotypes. TCR complementarity-determining region 
      cloning of expanded T cell clones in the tumors following vaccination confirmed 
      reactivity against vaccine-encoded neoantigens. Our results support the PTCV's 
      mechanism of action based on the induction of antitumor T cells and show that a 
      PTCV plus pembrolizumab has clinical activity in advanced HCC. ClinicalTrials.gov 
      identifier: NCT04251117 .

TI  - Global Burden and Trends of Primary Liver Cancer Attributable to Comorbid Type 2 
      Diabetes Mellitus Among People Living with Hepatitis B: An Observational Trend 
      Study from 1990 to 2019.
PG  - 398-410
LID - 10.1007/s44197-024-00237-1 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) increases the risk of liver cancer 
      among people living with hepatitis B virus (HBV). Our study aimed to estimate the 
      global burden and trends of liver cancer attributable to comorbid T2DM among 
      people living with HBV from 1990 to 2019. METHODS: We calculated the population 
      attributable fractions (PAFs) of liver cancer attributable to comorbid T2DM among 
      the burden of HBV-related liver cancer. We applied the PAFs to the burden of 
      HBV-related liver cancer derived from the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) 2019 
      database to obtain the burden of liver cancer attributable to HBV-T2DM 
      comorbidity. The prevalence, disability-adjusted life year (DALY), and deaths of 
      liver cancer attributable to the comorbidity were assessed at the global, 
      regional, and country levels and then stratified by the sociodemographic index 
      (SDI), sex, and age group. Estimated annual percentage changes (EAPCs) were 
      calculated to quantify the temporal trends. RESULTS: In 2019, the global 
      age-standardized prevalence and DALY rates of liver cancer attributable to 
      HBV-T2DM comorbidity were 9.9 (8.4-11.5) and 182.4 (154.9-212.7) per 10,000,000 
      individuals, respectively. High-income Asia Pacific and East Asia had the highest 
      age-standardized prevalence and DALY rates of liver cancer attributable to 
      HBV-T2DM comorbidity, respectively. From 1990 to 2019, age-standardized 
      prevalence and DALY rates increased in 16 out of 21 GBD regions. High-income 
      North America had the largest annual increases in both age-standardized 
      prevalence rates (EAPC = 6.07; 95% UI, 5.59 to 6.56) and DALY rates (EAPC = 4.77; 
      95% UI, 4.35 to 5.20), followed by Australasia and Central Asia. Across all SDI 
      regions, the high SDI region exhibited the most rapid increase in 
      age-standardized prevalence and DALY rates from 1990 to 2019. Additionally, men 
      had consistently higher disease burdens than women across all age groups. The 
      patterns of mortality burden and trends are similar to those of DALYs. 
      CONCLUSIONS: The burden of liver cancer attributable to comorbid T2DM among 
      people living with HBV has exhibited an increasing trend across most regions over 
      the last three decades. Tailored prevention strategies targeting T2DM should be 
      implemented among individuals living with HBV.

TI  - Adjuvant sintilimab in resected high-risk hepatocellular carcinoma: a randomized, 
      controlled, phase 2 trial.

AB  - Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), particularly when accompanied by microvascular 
      invasion (MVI), has a markedly high risk of recurrence after liver resection. 
      Adjuvant immunotherapy is considered a promising avenue. This multicenter, 
      open-label, randomized, controlled, phase 2 trial was conducted at six hospitals 
      in China to assess the efficacy and safety of adjuvant sintilimab, a programmed 
      cell death protein 1 inhibitor, in these patients. Eligible patients with HCC 
      with MVI were randomized (1:1) into the sintilimab or active surveillance group. 
      The sintilimab group received intravenous injections every 3 weeks for a total of 
      eight cycles. The primary endpoint was recurrence-free survival (RFS) in the 
      intention-to-treat population. Key secondary endpoints included overall survival 
      (OS) and safety. From September 1, 2020, to April 23, 2022, a total of 198 
      eligible patients were randomly allocated to receive adjuvant sintilimab (n = 99) 
      or undergo active surveillance (n = 99). After a median follow-up of 23.3 months, 
      the trial met the prespecified endpoints. Sintilimab significantly prolonged RFS 
      compared to active surveillance (median RFS, 27.7 versus 15.5 months; hazard 
      ratio 0.534, 95% confidence interval 0.360-0.792; P = 0.002). Further follow-up 
      is needed to confirm the difference in OS. In the sintilimab group, 12.4% of 
      patients experienced grade 3 or 4 treatment-related adverse events, the most 
      common of which were elevated alanine aminotransferase levels (5.2%) and anemia 
      (4.1%). These findings support the potential of immune checkpoint inhibitors as 
      effective adjuvant therapy for these high-risk patients. Chinese Clinical Trial

TI  - Immune signatures of checkpoint inhibitor-induced autoimmunity-A focus on 
      neurotoxicity.
PG  - 279-294
LID - 10.1093/neuonc/noad198 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Neurologic immune-related adverse events (irAE-n) are rare but severe 
      toxicities of immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) treatment. To overcome diagnostic 
      and therapeutic challenges, a better mechanistic understanding of irAE-n is 
      paramount. METHODS: In this observational cohort study, we collected serum and 
      peripheral blood samples from 34 consecutive cancer patients with irAE-n (during 
      acute illness) and 49 cancer control patients without irAE-n (pre- and on-ICI 
      treatment, n = 44 without high-grade irAEs, n = 5 with high-grade nonneurologic 
      irAEs). Patients received either anti-programmed cell death protein (PD)-1 or 
      anti-PD ligand-1 monotherapy or anti-PD-1/anti-cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated 
      protein-4 combination therapy. Most common cancers were melanoma, lung cancer, 
      and hepatocellular carcinoma. Peripheral blood immune profiling was performed 
      using 48-marker single-cell mass cytometry and a multiplex cytokine assay. 
      RESULTS: During acute illness, patients with irAE-n presented higher frequencies 
      of cluster of differentiation (CD)8+ effector memory type (EM-)1 and central 
      memory (CM) T cells compared to controls without irAEs. Multiorgan 
      immunotoxicities (neurologic + nonneurologic) were associated with higher CD8+ 
      EM1 T cell counts. While there were no B cell changes in the overall cohort, we 
      detected a marked decrease of IgD- CD11c+ CD21low and IgD- CD24+ CD21high B cells 
      in a subgroup of patients with autoantibody-positive irAE-n. We further 
      identified signatures indicative of enhanced chemotaxis and inflammation in 
      irAE-n patients and discovered C-X-C motif chemokine ligand (CXCL)10 as a 
      promising marker to diagnose high-grade immunotoxicities such as irAE-n. 
      CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrate profound and partly subgroup-specific immune cell 
      dysregulation in irAE-n patients, which may guide future biomarker development 
      and targeted treatment approaches.

TI  - Treatment of localized hepatocellular carcinoma: resection vs. ablation vs. 
      radiation.
PG  - 344-354
LID - 10.21037/apm-23-486 [doi]
AB  - Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a common malignancy with many patients 
      presenting with local disease. As of date, the use of radiation is not included 
      in the commonly utilized Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC) classification but 
      is in the National Comprehensive Cancer Network guidelines. Radiation can 
      volumetrically cover the entire tumor and with novel technologic advances can be 
      administered non-invasively with excellent clinical outcomes with few adverse 
      events. The gold standard for localized early HCC (such as BCLC-A) is resection 
      or transplantation. In patients who are not candidates for surgical treatment, 
      locoregional therapy should be considered as an optimal therapy for these 
      patients. Tumor ablation techniques such as microwave ablation (MWA) and 
      radiofrequency ablation (RFA) are excellent tools to control local disease or 
      bridge to transplantation. Should these not be possible though then ablation with 
      external beam radiation is also capable of yielding comparable local control and 
      serve as a bridge to transplant without worse rates of adverse events. For tumors 
      that meet Milan criteria for transplantation, in comparison to transarterial 
      chemoembolization (TACE), there is considerable randomized evidence demonstrating 
      better local control, less adverse events, better progression-free survival 
      (PFS), and less costly. It can be utilized as a bridge in Barcelona liver class 
      B. For larger localized tumors though (extrahepatic disease or vascular invasion 
      like BCLC-C), stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) is shown via a 
      randomized clinical trial to have a survival benefit, local control benefit, and 
      no worse adverse events compared to systemic therapy. In this setting, it should 
      be considered the local consolidation standard of care.

TI  - Regorafenib plus nivolumab in unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma: the phase 2 
      RENOBATE trial.
PG  - 699-707
LID - 10.1038/s41591-024-02824-y [doi]
AB  - Regorafenib has anti-tumor activity in patients with unresectable hepatocellular 
      carcinoma (uHCC) with potential immunomodulatory effects, suggesting that its 
      combination with immune checkpoint inhibitor may have clinically meaningful 
      benefits in patients with uHCC. The multicenter, single-arm, phase 2 RENOBATE 
      trial tested regorafenib-nivolumab as front-line treatment for uHCC. Forty-two 
      patients received nivolumab 480 mg every 4 weeks and regorafenib 80 mg daily 
      (3-weeks-on/1-week-off schedule). The primary endpoint was the 
      investigator-assessed objective response rate (ORR) per Response Evaluation 
      Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) version 1.1. The secondary endpoints included 
      safety, progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS). ORR per RECIST 
      version 1.1 was 31.0%, meeting the primary endpoint. The most common adverse 
      events were palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia syndrome (38.1%), alopecia (26.2%) 
      and skin rash (23.8%). Median PFS was 7.38 months. The 1-year OS rate was 80.5%, 
      and the median OS was not reached. Exploratory single-cell RNA sequencing 
      analyses of peripheral blood mononuclear cells showed that long-term responders 
      exhibited T cell receptor repertoire diversification, enrichment of genes 
      representing immunotherapy responsiveness in MKI67(+) proliferating CD8(+) T 
      cells and a higher probability of M1-directed monocyte polarization. Our data 
      support further clinical development of the regorafenib-nivolumab combination as 
      front-line treatment for uHCC and provide preliminary insights on immune 
      biomarkers of response. ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT04310709 .

TI  - Palliative radiotherapy versus best supportive care in patients with painful 
      hepatic cancer (CCTG HE1): a multicentre, open-label, randomised, controlled, 
      phase 3 study.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Palliative treatment options for painful hepatic cancer can be 
      restricted due to patients eventually becoming refractory to standard treatment. 
      The aim of this study was to determine whether radiotherapy improves hepatic pain 
      from cancer. METHODS: In this open-label, randomised, controlled, phase 3 trial 
      (CCTG HE1) done in nine cancer centres across Canada, we included patients aged 
      18 years or older with hepatocellular carcinoma or liver metastases, who were 
      refractory to standard treatment, with an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group 
      performance status of 0-3, with life expectancy of more than 3 months, and pain 
      or discomfort at its worst in the past 24 hours on the Brief Pain Inventory (BPI) 
      of at least 4 out of 10, which was stable for up to 7 days before randomisation. 
      Patients were randomly assigned (1:1), via a minimisation method after 
      stratification by centre and type of cancer (hepatocellular carcinoma vs liver 
      metastases), to single-fraction radiotherapy (8 Gy) to the liver with 8 mg 
      ondansetron (or equivalent) orally and 4 mg dexamethasone orally given 1-2 h 
      before radiotherapy plus best supportive care (including non-opioid or opioid 
      analgesia, or dexamethasone, or a combination of these) or best supportive care 
      alone. The primary endpoint was improvement in patient-reported liver cancer pain 
      or discomfort of at least 2 points on worst pain intensity on the BPI at 1 month 
      after randomisation. All patients with both baseline and 1-month assessments were 
      included in the primary endpoint analysis. Safety was assessed in all patients 
      randomly assigned to treatment. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, 
      NCT02511522, and is complete. FINDINGS: Between July 25, 2015, and June 2, 2022, 
      66 patients were screened and randomly assigned to radiotherapy plus best 
      supportive care (n=33) or best supportive care (n=33). Median age was 65 years 
      (IQR 57-72), 37 (56%) of 66 patients were male, 29 (44%) were female, 43 (65%) 
      had liver metastases, and 23 (35%) had hepatocellular carcinoma (data on race and 
      ethnicity were not collected). As of data cutoff (Sept 8, 2022), median follow-up 
      was 3·2 months (95% CI 3·0-3·4). 24 (73%) of 33 in the radiotherapy plus best 
      supportive care group and 18 (55%) of 33 in the best supportive care only group 
      completed baseline and 1-month assessments. An improvement in hepatic pain of at 
      least 2 points in worst pain intensity on the BPI at 1 month was seen in 16 (67%) 
      of 24 patients in the radiotherapy plus best supportive care group versus four 
      (22%) of 18 patients in the best supportive care group (p=0·0042). The most 
      common grade 3-4 adverse events within 1 month after randomisation were abdominal 
      pain (three [9%] of 33 in the radiotherapy group vs one [3%] of 33 in best 
      supportive care group) and ascites (two [6%] vs one [3%]). No serious adverse 
      events or treatment-related deaths were observed. INTERPRETATION: Single-fraction 
      radiotherapy plus best supportive care improved pain compared with best 
      supportive care alone in patients with liver cancer, and could be considered a 
      standard palliative treatment. FUNDING: Canadian Cancer Society.

TI  - Outcomes of Various Classes of Oral Antidiabetic Drugs on Nonalcoholic Fatty 
      Liver Disease.
PG  - 375-383
LID - 10.1001/jamainternmed.2023.8029 [doi]
AB  - IMPORTANCE: Several oral antidiabetic drug (OAD) classes can potentially improve 
      patient outcomes in nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) to varying degrees, 
      but clinical data on which class is favored are lacking. OBJECTIVE: To 
      investigate which OAD is associated with the best patient outcomes in NAFLD and 
      type 2 diabetes (T2D). DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This retrospective 
      nonrandomized interventional cohort study used the National Health Information 
      Database, which provided population-level data for Korea. This study involved 
      patients with T2D and concomitant NAFLD. EXPOSURES: Receiving either 
      sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors, thiazolidinediones, dipeptidyl 
      peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitors, or sulfonylureas, each combined with metformin 
      for 80% or more of 90 consecutive days. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The main 
      outcomes were NAFLD regression assessed by the fatty liver index and composite 
      liver-related outcome (defined as liver-related hospitalization, liver-related 
      mortality, liver transplant, and hepatocellular carcinoma) using the Fine-Gray 
      model regarding competing risks. RESULTS: In total, 80 178 patients (mean [SD] 
      age, 58.5 [11.9] years; 43 007 [53.6%] male) were followed up for 219 941 
      person-years, with 4102 patients experiencing NAFLD regression. When compared 
      with sulfonylureas, SGLT2 inhibitors (adjusted subdistribution hazard ratio 
      [ASHR], 1.99 [95% CI, 1.75-2.27]), thiazolidinediones (ASHR, 1.70 [95% CI, 
      1.41-2.05]), and DPP-4 inhibitors (ASHR, 1.45 [95% CI, 1.31-1.59]) were 
      associated with NAFLD regression. SGLT2 inhibitors were associated with a higher 
      likelihood of NAFLD regression when compared with thiazolidinediones (ASHR, 1.40 
      [95% CI, 1.12-1.75]) and DPP-4 inhibitors (ASHR, 1.45 [95% CI, 1.30-1.62]). Only 
      SGLT2 inhibitors (ASHR, 0.37 [95% CI, 0.17-0.82]), not thiazolidinediones or 
      DPP-4 inhibitors, were significantly associated with lower incidence rates of 
      adverse liver-related outcomes when compared with sulfonylureas. CONCLUSIONS AND 
      RELEVANCE: The results of this cohort study suggest that physicians may lean 
      towards prescribing SGLT2 inhibitors as the preferred OAD for individuals with 
      NAFLD and T2D, considering their potential benefits in NAFLD regression and lower 
      incidences of adverse liver-related outcomes. This observational study should 
      prompt future research to determine whether prescribing practices might merit 
      reexamination.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Liver cirrhosis, the advanced stage of many chronic liver diseases, 
      is associated with escalated risks of liver-related complications like 
      decompensation and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Morbidity and mortality in 
      cirrhosis patients are linked to portal hypertension, sarcopenia, and 
      hepatocellular carcinoma. Although conventional cirrhosis management centered on 
      treating complications, contemporary approaches prioritize preemptive measures. 
      This study aims to formulate novel blood- and imaging-centric methodologies for 
      monitoring liver cirrhosis patients. METHODS: In this prospective study, 150 
      liver cirrhosis patients will be enrolled from three Swedish liver clinics. Their 
      conditions will be assessed through extensive blood-based markers and magnetic 
      resonance imaging (MRI). The MRI protocol encompasses body composition profile 
      with Muscle Assement Score, portal flow assessment, magnet resonance 
      elastography, and a abbreviated MRI for HCC screening. Evaluation of lifestyle, 
      muscular strength, physical performance, body composition, and quality of life 
      will be conducted. Additionally, DNA, serum, and plasma biobanking will 
      facilitate future investigations. DISCUSSION: The anticipated outcomes involve 
      the identification and validation of non-invasive blood- and imaging-oriented 
      biomarkers, enhancing the care paradigm for liver cirrhosis patients. Notably, 
      the temporal evolution of these biomarkers will be crucial for understanding 
      dynamic changes. TRIAL REGISTRATION: Clinicaltrials.gov, registration identifier

TI  - Endoscopic variceal ligation versus propranolol for the primary prevention of 
      oesophageal variceal bleeding in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma: an 
      open-label, two-centre, randomised controlled trial.
PG  - 682-690
LID - 10.1136/gutjnl-2023-330419 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: This randomised trial aimed to address whether endoscopic variceal 
      ligation (EVL) or propranolol (PPL) is more effective at preventing initial 
      oesophageal variceal bleeding (EVB) in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma 
      (HCC). DESIGN: Patients with HCC and medium-to-large oesophageal varices (EVs) 
      but without previous EVB were randomised to receive EVL (every 3-4 weeks until 
      variceal eradication) or PPL (up to 320 mg daily) at a 1:1 ratio. Long-term 
      follow-up data on EVB, other upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB), non-bleeding 
      liver decompensation, overall survival (OS) and adverse events (AEs) were 
      analysed using competing risk regression. RESULTS: Between June 2011 and April 
      2021, 144 patients were randomised to receive EVL (n=72) or PPL (n=72). In the 
      EVL group, 7 patients experienced EVB, and 30 died; in the PPL group, 19 patients 
      had EVB, and 40 died. The EVL group had a lower cumulative incidence of EVB 
      (Gray's test, p=0.009) than its counterpart, with no mortality difference (Gray's 
      test, p=0.085). For patients with Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC) stage A/B, 
      EVL was better than PPL in reducing EVB (p<0.001) and mortality (p=0.003). For 
      patients beyond BCLC stage B, between-group outcomes were similar. Other UGIB, 
      non-bleeding liver decompensation and AEs did not differ between groups. A 
      competing risk regression model confirmed the prognostic value of EVL. 
      CONCLUSION: EVL is superior to PPL in preventing initial EVB in patients with 
      HCC. The benefits of EVL on EVB and OS may be limited to patients with BCLC stage 
      A/B and not to those with BCLC stage C/D. TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: NCT01970748.

TI  - Oral Simnotrelvir for Adult Patients with Mild-to-Moderate Covid-19.
PG  - 230-241
LID - 10.1056/NEJMoa2301425 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Simnotrelvir is an oral 3-chymotrypsin-like protease inhibitor that 
      has been found to have in vitro activity against severe acute respiratory 
      syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and potential efficacy in a phase 1B trial. 
      METHODS: In this phase 2-3, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial, 
      we assigned patients who had mild-to-moderate coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) 
      and onset of symptoms within the past 3 days in a 1:1 ratio to receive 750 mg of 
      simnotrelvir plus 100 mg of ritonavir or placebo twice daily for 5 days. The 
      primary efficacy end point was the time to sustained resolution of symptoms, 
      defined as the absence of 11 Covid-19-related symptoms for 2 consecutive days. 
      Safety and changes in viral load were also assessed. RESULTS: A total of 1208 
      patients were enrolled at 35 sites in China; 603 were assigned to receive 
      simnotrelvir and 605 to receive placebo. Among patients in the modified 
      intention-to-treat population who received the first dose of trial drug or 
      placebo within 72 hours after symptom onset, the time to sustained resolution of 
      Covid-19 symptoms was significantly shorter in the simnotrelvir group than in the 
      placebo group (180.1 hours [95% confidence interval {CI}, 162.1 to 201.6] vs. 
      216.0 hours [95% CI, 203.4 to 228.1]; median difference, -35.8 hours [95% CI, 
      -60.1 to -12.4]; P = 0.006 by Peto-Prentice test). On day 5, the decrease in 
      viral load from baseline was greater in the simnotrelvir group than in the 
      placebo group (mean difference [±SE], -1.51±0.14 log(10) copies per milliliter; 
      95% CI, -1.79 to -1.24). The incidence of adverse events during treatment was 
      higher in the simnotrelvir group than in the placebo group (29.0% vs. 21.6%). 
      Most adverse events were mild or moderate. CONCLUSIONS: Early administration of 
      simnotrelvir plus ritonavir shortened the time to the resolution of symptoms 
      among adult patients with Covid-19, without evident safety concerns. (Funded by

TI  - A Phase I/IIa Trial of Yttrium-90 Radioembolization in Combination with 
      Durvalumab for Locally Advanced Unresectable Hepatocellular Carcinoma.
PG  - 3650-3658
LID - 10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-23-0581 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Synergistic effect of radiotherapy and immunotherapy for the treatment 
      of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) has been reported. This phase I/IIa pilot trial 
      evaluated preliminary efficacy and safety of combination of radioembolization 
      with yttrium-90 microspheres (Y90-radioembolization) and durvalumab in patients 
      with locally advanced unresectable HCC. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients with 
      Child-Pugh score ≤ 7 and locally advanced HCC, defined as Barcelona Clinic Liver 
      Cancer (BCLC) stage B HCC or BCLC-C disease without extrahepatic metastases, 
      received Y90-radioembolization followed by intravenous durvalumab 1,500 mg 7 to 
      14 days after Y90-radioembolization and every 4 weeks thereafter. Primary 
      endpoint was time to progression (TTP) assessed by modified RECIST (mRECIST). 
      Secondary endpoints included overall survival (OS), progression-free survival 
      (PFS), objective response rate (ORR) determined by mRECIST, and safety. RESULTS: 
      All 24 patients enrolled received Y90-radioembolization and 23 received at least 
      one dose of durvalumab. Median follow-up duration was 19.0 months (range, 
      2.2-24.2). Median TTP was 15.2 months [95% confidence interval (CI), 6.1-not 
      estimated]. Median OS was not reached and 18-month OS rate was 58.3% (95% CI, 
      36.4-75.0). Median PFS was 6.9 months (95% CI, 5.4-15.2). Seven (29.2%) patients 
      had a complete response and 13 (54.2%) had a partial response; ORR was 83.3% (95% 
      CI, 62.6-95.3). Eleven (47.8%) patients experienced any-grade treatment-related 
      adverse events. Two (8.7%) patients had grade 3 treatment-related adverse events 
      (neutropenia and fever). None experienced any treatment-related serious adverse 
      events. CONCLUSIONS: In patients with locally advanced unresectable HCC, the 
      combination of Y90-radioembolization and durvalumab demonstrated promising 
      efficacy and safety, warranting further evaluation in large-scale controlled 
      trials.

TI  - Atezolizumab plus bevacizumab versus lenvatinib for unresectable hepatocellular 
      carcinoma: a large real-life worldwide population.
PG  - 9-20

AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Atezolizumab plus bevacizumab and lenvatinib have not been 
      compared in a randomised controlled trial. We conducted a retrospective 
      multi-centre study to compare the clinical efficacy and safety of lenvatinib and 
      atezolizumab with bevacizumab as a first-line treatment for patients with 
      unresectable HCC in the real-world scenario. METHODS: Clinical features of 
      lenvatinib and atezolizumab plus bevacizumab patients were balanced through 
      inverse probability of treatment weighting (IPTW) methodology, which weights 
      patients' characteristics and measured outcomes of each patient in both treatment 
      arms. Overall survival (OS) was the primary end-point. RESULTS: The analysis 
      included 1341 patients who received lenvatinib, and 864 patients who received 
      atezolizumab plus bevacizumab. After IPTW adjustment, atezolizumab plus 
      bevacizumab did not show a survival advantage over lenvatinib HR 0.97 
      (p = 0.739). OS was prolonged by atezolizumab plus bevacizumab over lenvatinib in 
      viral patients (HR: 0.76; p = 0.024). Conversely, OS was prolonged by lenvatinib 
      in patients with non-alcoholic steatohepatitis/non-alcoholic fatty liver disease 
      (HR: 1.88; p = 0.014). In the IPTW-adjusted population, atezolizumab plus 
      bevacizumab provided better safety profile for most of the recorded adverse 
      events. CONCLUSION: Our study did not identify any meaningful difference in OS 
      between atezolizumab plus bevacizumab and lenvatinib. Although some hints are 
      provided suggesting that patients with non-alcoholic 
      steatohepatitis/non-alcoholic fatty liver disease might benefit more from 
      lenvatinib therapy and patients with viral aetiology more from atezolizumab plus 
      bevacizumab.

TI  - Nivolumab Plus Cabozantinib With or Without Ipilimumab for Advanced 
      Hepatocellular Carcinoma: Results From Cohort 6 of the CheckMate 040 Trial.
PG  - 1747-1757
LID - 10.1200/JCO.22.00972 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: To investigate the safety and efficacy of nivolumab plus cabozantinib 
      with or without ipilimumab in patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma. 
      METHODS: In cohort 6 of the multicohort, open-label, phase I/II CheckMate 040 
      study, patients who were treatment-naive, sorafenib-intolerant, or had progressed 
      on sorafenib were randomly assigned 1:1 to nivolumab 240 mg once every 2 weeks 
      plus cabozantinib 40 mg once daily (doublet arm); or nivolumab 3 mg/kg every 2 
      weeks plus cabozantinib 40 mg once daily with ipilimumab 1 mg/kg once every 6 
      weeks (triplet arm). Primary objectives were safety and tolerability, objective 
      response rate, and duration of response by investigator assessment per RECIST 
      v1.1. Secondary objectives included progression-free survival (by blinded 
      independent central review) and overall survival. RESULTS: Seventy-one patients 
      were randomly assigned: 36 to the doublet arm and 35 to the triplet arm. After 
      32.0-month median follow-up, objective response rate (95% CI) was 17% (6 to 33) 
      and 29% (15 to 46) in the doublet and triplet arms, respectively. Median (95% CI) 
      duration of response was 8.3 (6.9 to not estimable) months in the doublet arm and 
      not reached (0.0 to not estimable) in the triplet arm. Median progression-free 
      survival was 5.1 and 4.3 months, and median overall survival was 20.2 and 22.1 
      months for the doublet and triplet arms, respectively. Grade 3-4 
      treatment-related adverse events occurred in 50% and 74% of patients and 
      treatment-related adverse events leading to discontinuation were reported for 11% 
      and 23% in the doublet and triplet arms, respectively. There were no 
      treatment-related deaths in either arm. CONCLUSION: Nivolumab plus cabozantinib 
      with or without ipilimumab showed encouraging preliminary antitumor activity and 
      had consistent safety profiles with those established for the individual drugs in 
      patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma.

      However, the standard of care in first-line treatment with atezolizumab 
      (anti-PD-L1 therapy) in combination with bevacizumab is associated with a limited 
      objective response rate. Telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT) activation meets 
      the criteria of oncogenic addiction in HCC and could be actionable therapeutic 
      target and a relevant tumor antigen. Therefore we hypothesized that combining 
      anti-PD-1/PD-L1 therapy with an anti-telomerase vaccine might be an attractive 
      therapy in HCC. UCPVax is a therapeutic cancer vaccine composed of two separate 
      peptides derived from telomerase (human TERT). UCPVax has been evaluated in a 
      multicenter phase I/II study in non-small cell lung cancers and has demonstrated 
      to be safe and immunogenic, and is under evaluation in combination with 
      atezolizumab in a phase II clinical trial in tumors where telomerase reactivation 
      contributes to an oncogene addiction (HPV(+) cancers). The aim of the TERTIO 
      study is to determine the clinical interest and immunological efficacy of a 
      treatment combining the CD4 helper T-inducer cancer anti-telomerase vaccine 
      (UCPVax) with atezolizumab and bevacizumab in unresectable HCC in a multicenter 
      randomized phase II study. METHODS: Patients with locally advanced, metastatic or 
      unresectable HCC who have not previously received systemic anti-cancer treatment 
      are eligible. The primary end point is the objective response rate at 6 months. 
      Patients will be allocated to a treatment arm with a randomization 2:1. In both 
      arms, patients will receive atezolizumab at fixed dose of 1200 mg IV infusion and 
      bevacizumab at fixed dose of 15 mg/kg IV infusion, every 3 weeks, according to 
      the standard of care. In the experimental arm, these treatments will be combined 
      with the UCPVax vaccine at 0.5 mg subcutaneously. DISCUSSION: Combining 
      anti-PD-1/PD-L1 therapy with an anti-telomerase vaccine gains serious 
      consideration in HCC, in order to extend the clinical efficacy of 
      anti-PD-1/PD-L1. Indeed, anti-cancer vaccines can induce tumor-specific T cell 
      expansion and activation and therefore restore the cancer-immunity cycle in 
      patients lacking pre-existing anti-tumor responses. Thus, there is a strong 
      rational to combine immune checkpoint blockade therapy and anticancer vaccine 
      (UCPVax) in order to activate antitumor T cell immunity and bypass the 
      immunosuppression in the tumor microenvironment in HCC. This pivotal proof of 
      concept study will evaluate the efficacy and safety of the combination of a CD4 
      Th1-inducer cancer vaccine derived from telomerase (UCPVax) and atezolizumab plus 
      bevacizumab in unresectable HCC, as well as confirming their synergic mechanism, 
      and settling the basis for a new combination for future clinical trials. TRIAL

AB  - BACKGROUND: Patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (aHCC) have a poor 
      prognosis and high mortality. Nivolumab monotherapy demonstrated clinical benefit 
      with an acceptable safety profile in patients with aHCC in the CheckMate 040 
      study. Five-year follow-up of the sorafenib-naive and sorafenib-experienced 
      groups of CheckMate 040 is presented here. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients 
      received nivolumab monotherapy at dose levels of 0.1-10.0 mg/kg (dose-escalation 
      phase) or 3 mg/kg (dose-expansion phase) every 2 weeks until disease progression 
      or unacceptable toxicity. Primary endpoints were safety and tolerability (dose 
      escalation), and objective response rate (ORR) by blinded independent central 
      review (BICR) and by investigator as per RECIST version 1.1 (dose expansion). 
      RESULTS: Eighty sorafenib-naive and 154 sorafenib-experienced patients were 
      treated. Minimum follow-up in both groups was 60 months. ORR as per BICR was 20% 
      [95% confidence interval (CI) 12% to 30%] and 14% (95% CI 9% to 21%) in the 
      sorafenib-naive and sorafenib-experienced groups, respectively. Responses 
      occurred regardless of HCC etiology or baseline tumor cell programmed 
      death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression levels. Median overall survival (OS) was 26.6 
      months (95% CI 16.6-30.6 months) and 15.1 months (95% CI 13.0-18.2 months) in 
      sorafenib-naive and sorafenib-experienced patients, respectively. The 3-year OS 
      rates were 28% in the sorafenib-naive and 20% in the sorafenib-experienced 
      groups; 5-year OS rates were 14% and 12%, respectively. No new safety signals 
      were identified; grade 3/4 treatment-related adverse events were observed in 33% 
      and 21% of patients in the sorafenib-naive and sorafenib-experienced groups, 
      respectively. Biomarker analyses showed that baseline PD-L1 expression ≥1% was 
      associated with higher ORR and longer OS compared with PD-L1 <1%. In the 
      sorafenib-naive group, patients with OS ≥3 years exhibited higher baseline CD8 
      T-cell density compared with those with OS <1 year. CONCLUSION: With 5 years of 
      follow-up, nivolumab monotherapy continued to provide durable clinical benefit 
      with manageable safety in sorafenib-naive and sorafenib-experienced patients with 
      aHCC.

AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: Prospective data on treatment after immune checkpoint 
      inhibitor (ICI) therapy in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) are lacking. We 
      conducted a phase II multicentre study on cabozantinib after ICI treatment in 
      HCC. METHODS: This is an investigator-initiated, single-arm, clinical trial 
      involving academic centres in Hong Kong and Korea. Key eligibility criteria 
      included diagnosis of HCC, refractoriness to prior ICI-based treatment, and 
      Child-Pugh A liver function. A maximum of two prior lines of therapy were 
      allowed. All patients were commenced on cabozantinib at 60 mg/day. The primary 
      endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS). RESULTS: Forty-seven patients were 
      recruited from Oct 2020 to May 2022; 27 and 20 patients had received one and two 
      prior therapies, respectively. Median follow-up was 11.2 months. The median PFS 
      was 4.1 months (95% CI 3.3-5.3). The median overall survival (OS) was 9.9 months 
      (95% CI 7.3-14.4), and the 1-year OS rate was 45.3%. Partial response and stable 
      disease occurred in 3 (6.4%) and 36 (76.6%) patients, respectively. When used as 
      a second-line treatment (n = 27), cabozantinib was associated with a median PFS 
      and OS of 4.3 (95% CI 3.3-6.7) and 14.3 (95% CI 8.9-NR) months, respectively. The 
      corresponding median PFS and OS were 4.3 (95% CI 3.3-11.0) and 14.3 (95% CI 
      9.0-NR) months, respectively, for those receiving ICI-based regimens with proven 
      benefits (n = 17). The most common grade 3-4 treatment-related adverse event was 
      thrombocytopenia (6.4%). The median dose of cabozantinib was 40 mg/day. The 
      number of prior therapies was an independent prognosticator (one vs. two; hazard 
      ratio = 0.37; p = 0.03). CONCLUSIONS: Cabozantinib demonstrated efficacy in 
      patients who had received prior ICI regimens; survival data for second-line 
      cabozantinib following first-line ICI regimens provide a reference for future 
      clinical trial design. The number of prior lines of treatment may be considered a 
      stratification factor in randomised studies. IMPACT AND IMPLICATIONS: Prospective 
      data on systemic treatment following prior immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) 
      therapy for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) are lacking. This phase II clinical 
      trial provides efficacy and safety data on cabozantinib in patients who had 
      received prior ICI-based treatment. Exploratory analyses showed that the 
      performance of cabozantinib differed significantly when used as a second- or 
      third-line treatment. The above data could be used as a reference for clinical 
      practice and the design of future clinical trials on subsequent treatment lines 
      following ICIs. GOV IDENTIFIER: NCT04588051.

TI  - Stereotactic body radiotherapy combined with sintilimab in patients with 
      recurrent or oligometastatic hepatocellular carcinoma: A phase II clinical trial.
PG  - 3871-3882

AB  - BACKGROUND: Stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) and programmed cell death 1 
      inhibitors have shown potential in treating hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in 
      retrospective studies. AIM: To evaluate the efficacy of combining SBRT with 
      sintilimab for patients with recurrent or oligometastatic HCC. METHODS: This 
      trial involved patients with recurrent or oligometastatic HCC intravenously 
      treated with SBRT plus sintilimab every 3 wk for 12 mo or until disease 
      progression. The primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS). RESULTS: 
      Twenty-five patients were enrolled from August 14, 2019, to August 23, 2021. The 
      median treatment duration was 10.2 (range, 0.7-14.6) months. SBRT was delivered 
      at a median dose of 54 (range, 48-60) Gy in 6 (range, 6-10) fractions. The median 
      follow-up time was 21.9 (range, 10.3-39.7) mo, and 32 targeted lesions among 25 
      patients were evaluated for treatment response according to the Response 
      Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors version 1.1. The median PFS was 19.7 mo [95% 
      confidence interval (CI): 16.9-NA], with PFS rates of 68% (95%CI: 52-89) and 
      45.3% (95%CI: 28-73.4) at 12 and 24 mo, respectively. The median overall survival 
      (OS) was not reached, with OS rates of 91.5% (95%CI: 80.8-100.0) and 83.2% 
      (95%CI: 66.5-100.0) at 12 and 24 mo, respectively. The 1- and 2-year local 
      control rate were 100% and 90.9% (95%CI: 75.4%-100.0%), respectively. The 
      confirmed objective response rate and disease control rate was 96%, and 96%, 
      respectively. Most adverse events were graded as 1 or 2, and grade 3 adverse 
      events were observed in three patients. CONCLUSION: SBRT plus sintilimab is an 
      effective, well-tolerated treatment regimen for patients with recurrent or 
      oligometastatic HCC.

AB  - Hepatocellular carcinoma remains a significant worldwide malignancy and an 
      important cause of cancer-related death. The incidence is increasing globally. In 
      Latin America, there is no consistent data on the epidemiology of hepatocellular 
      carcinoma. However, Brazil is considered a country with an intermediate incidence 
      of this liver neoplasm. In the state of Ceará, situated in the northeast region 
      of Brazil, there are no consistent clinical and epidemiologic data on the actual 
      incidence and the treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma. The purpose of this 
      article is to describe epidemiologic characteristics and treatment forms of 
      patients with hepatocellular carcinoma who were treated in a Liver Transplant 
      Center. A retrospective observational study was conducted using the database from 
      the register of 299 patients with hepatocellular carcinoma between June 2004 and 
      February 2022. Only patients born in Ceará were included. Therefore, most 
      patients were eligible, based on the Milan Criteria, to undergo liver 
      transplantation with a Model End Stage Liver Disease score of 12.48 ± 4.66 
      points, and the waiting list time was approximately 7 months with 8.7% 
      hepatocellular carcinoma recurrence after liver transplant. A total of 38.5 % of 
      cases were outside the Milan criteria at the time of cancer diagnosis, and 
      transarterial chemoembolization was the main treatment choice. In conclusion, the 
      diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma in Ceará mainly occurs in male patients 
      with hepatitis C or alcoholism, with a mean age of 61.55 years and a previous 
      diagnosis of liver disease. Liver transplantation was the best curative 
      therapeutic form in patients with cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma in 
      Ceará, where a significant number of patients were diagnosed with intermediate 
      and advanced-stage hepatocellular carcinoma, so public health policies are 
      important for the screening and monitoring of liver disease.

AB  - Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) has multiple molecular classes that are associated 
      with distinct etiologies and, besides particular molecular characteristics, that 
      also differ in clinical aspects. We aim to characterize the clinical aspects of 
      alcoholic liver disease-related HCC by a retrospective observational study that 
      included all consequent patients diagnosed with MRI or histologically verified 
      HCC in participating centers from 2010 to 2016. A total of 429 patients were 
      included in the analysis, of which 412 patients (96%) had cirrhosis at the time 
      of diagnosis. The most common etiologies were alcoholic liver disease (ALD) 
      (48.3%), chronic hepatitis C (14.9%), NAFLD (12.6%), and chronic hepatitis B 
      (10%). Patients with ALD-related HCC were more commonly males, more commonly had 
      cirrhosis that was in more advanced stages, and had poorer performance status. 
      Despite these results, no differences were observed in the overall (median 8.1 
      vs. 8.5 months) and progression-free survival (median 4.9 vs. 5.7 months). 
      ALD-HCC patients within BCLC stage 0-A less frequently received potentially 
      curative treatment as compared to the control HCC patients (62.2% vs. 87.5%, p = 
      0.017); and in patients with ALD-HCC liver function (MELD score) seemed to have a 
      stronger influence on the prognosis compared to the control group HCC. Systemic 
      inflammatory indexes were strongly associated with survival in the whole cohort. 
      In conclusion, alcoholic liver disease is the most common cause of hepatocellular 
      carcinoma in Slovakia, accounting for almost 50% of cases; and patients with 
      ALD-related HCC more commonly had cirrhosis that was in more advanced stages and 
      had poorer performance status, although no difference in survival between 
      ALD-related and other etiology-related HCC was observed.

TI  - Patient-Reported Outcomes From the Phase III HIMALAYA Study of Tremelimumab Plus 
      Durvalumab in Unresectable Hepatocellular Carcinoma.
PG  - 2790-2799
LID - 10.1200/JCO.23.01462 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: In the phase III HIMALAYA study (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: 
      NCT03298451) in unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (uHCC), the Single 
      Tremelimumab Regular Interval Durvalumab (STRIDE) regimen significantly improved 
      overall survival versus sorafenib, and durvalumab monotherapy was noninferior to 
      sorafenib. Patient-reported outcomes (PROs), a secondary outcome from HIMALAYA, 
      are reported here. METHODS: Participants were randomly assigned to receive 
      STRIDE, durvalumab, or sorafenib. PROs were assessed (preplanned secondary 
      outcome) using the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer 
      30-item Quality of Life Questionnaire and the 18-item HCC module. Time to 
      deterioration (TTD), change from baseline and improvement rate in global health 
      status/quality of life (GHS/QoL), functioning, and disease-related symptoms were 
      analyzed. RESULTS: In total, 1,171 participants were randomly assigned to STRIDE 
      (n = 393), durvalumab (n = 389), or sorafenib (n = 389) and were evaluable for 
      PRO assessments. Across treatment arms, compliance rates for PROs were >77% at 
      baseline and >70% overall. Baseline scores were comparable across treatment arms. 
      TTD in GHS/QoL, physical functioning, fatigue, appetite loss, and abdominal pain 
      was numerically longer for both STRIDE and durvalumab versus sorafenib. 
      Clinically meaningful deterioration in PROs was not observed in any treatment 
      arm. However, TTD in nausea and abdominal swelling was numerically longer for 
      STRIDE versus sorafenib, and the likelihood of clinically meaningful improvement 
      in GHS/QoL, role, emotional and social functioning, and disease-related symptoms 
      was greater with STRIDE and durvalumab versus sorafenib. PROs with STRIDE and 
      durvalumab were generally similar. CONCLUSION: Compared with sorafenib, STRIDE 
      and durvalumab were associated with clinically meaningful, patient-centered 
      GHS/QoL, functioning, and symptom benefits in people with uHCC. These findings 
      support the benefits of the STRIDE regimen compared with sorafenib for a diverse 
      population reflective of the global uHCC population.

AB  - Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the most common type of primary liver cancer, 
      and patients with HCC have a poor prognosis and low survival rates. Establishing 
      a prognostic nomogram is important for predicting the survival of patients with 
      HCC, as it helps to improve the patient's prognosis. This study aimed to develop 
      and evaluate nomograms and risk stratification to predict overall survival (OS) 
      and cancer-specific survival (CSS) in HCC patients. Data from 10,302 patients 
      with initially diagnosed HCC were extracted from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, 
      and End Results (SEER) database between 2010 and 2017. Patients were randomly 
      divided into the training and validation set. Kaplan-Meier survival, LASSO 
      regression, and Cox regression analysis were conducted to select the predictors 
      of OS. Competing risk analysis, LASSO regression, and Cox regression analysis 
      were conducted to select the predictors of CSS. The validation of the nomograms 
      was performed using the concordance index (C-index), the Akaike information 
      criterion (AIC), the Bayesian information criterion (BIC), Net Reclassification 
      Index (NRI), Discrimination Improvement (IDI), the receiver operating 
      characteristic (ROC) curve, calibration curves, and decision curve analyses 
      (DCAs). The results indicated that factors including age, grade, T stage, N 
      stage, M stage, surgery, surgery to lymph node (LN), Alpha-Fetal Protein (AFP), 
      and tumor size were independent predictors of OS, whereas grade, T stage, 
      surgery, AFP, tumor size, and distant lymph node metastasis were independent 
      predictors of CSS. Based on these factors, predictive models were built and 
      virtualized by nomograms. The C-index for predicting 1-, 3-, and 5-year OS were 
      0.788, 0.792, and 0.790. The C-index for predicting 1-, 3-, and 5-year CSS were 
      0.803, 0.808, and 0.806. AIC, BIC, NRI, and IDI suggested that nomograms had an 
      excellent predictive performance with no significant overfitting. The calibration 
      curves showed good consistency of OS and CSS between the actual observation and 
      nomograms prediction, and the DCA showed great clinical usefulness of the 
      nomograms. The risk stratification of OS and CSS was built that could perfectly 
      classify HCC patients into three risk groups. Our study developed nomograms and a 
      corresponding risk stratification system predicting the OS and CSS of HCC 
      patients. These tools can assist in patient counseling and guiding treatment 
      decision making.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Early relapse after hepatectomy presents a significant challenge in 
      the treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The aim of this study was to 
      construct and validate a novel nomogram model for predicting early relapse and 
      survival after hepatectomy for HCC. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We conducted a 
      large-scale, multicenter retrospective analysis of 1,505 patients with surgically 
      treated HCC from 4 medical centers. All patients were randomly divided into 
      either the training cohort (n=1,053) or the validation cohort (n=452) in a 7:3 
      ratio. A machine learning-based nomogram model for prediction of HCC was 
      established by integrating multiple risk factors that influence early relapse and 
      survival, which were identified from preoperative clinical data and postoperative 
      pathologic characteristics of the patients. RESULTS: The median time to early 
      relapse was 7 months, whereas the median time from early relapse to death was 
      only 19 months. The concordance indexes of the postoperative nomogram for 
      predicting disease-free survival and overall survival were 0.741 and 0.739, 
      respectively, with well-calibrated curves demonstrating good consistency between 
      predicted and observed outcomes. Moreover, the accuracy and predictive 
      performance of the postoperative nomograms were significantly superior to those 
      of the preoperative nomogram and the other 7 HCC staging systems. The patients in 
      the intermediate- and high-risk groups of the model had significantly higher 
      probabilities of early and critical recurrence (P<.001), whereas those in the 
      low-risk group had higher probabilities of late and local recurrence (P<.001). 
      CONCLUSIONS: This postoperative nomogram model can better predict early 
      recurrence and survival and can serve as a useful tool to guide clinical 
      treatment decisions for patients with HCC.

      reality (VR) education program on anxiety and knowledge in HCC patients 
      undergoing hepatic resection. METHOD: From 1 January 2022 to 28 February 2023, 88 
      patients were enrolled in a randomized controlled trial, divided into the VR 
      group ( n =44) and the control group ( n =44). The VR group received 
      patient-specific 3D liver model education through a VR platform, while the 
      control group underwent conventional explanation processes. Both groups completed 
      preintervention and postintervention questionnaires assessing anxiety (using 
      STAI-X-1, STAI-X-2, and VAS) and knowledge about liver resection. Comparison of 
      the questionnaires were performed between the two groups. Multivariable logistic 
      regression was performed to analyze factor related to decrease in anxiety. 
      RESULT: While there was no significant difference in preintervention anxiety and 
      knowledge scores between the two groups, the VR group exhibited significant 
      reduction in STAI-X-1 scores (-4.14±7.5) compared to the control group 
      (-0.84±5.7, P =0.023), as well as knowledge scores (17.20±2.6) compared to the 
      control group (13.42±3.3, P <0.001). In the multivariable logistic regression 
      model, VR education showed significant impact on decrease in STAI-X-1 score, 
      postintervention. (OR=2.902, CI=1.097-7.674, P =0.032). CONCLUSION: The VR 
      education program significantly improved knowledge and reduced anxiety among HCC 
      patients compared to conventional methods. This study suggests that VR can be a 
      valuable tool in patient education, enhancing comprehension and alleviating 
      presurgical anxiety.

TI  - Predicting Post-hepatectomy Liver Failure Preoperatively for Child-Pugh A5 
      Hepatocellular Carcinoma Patients by Liver Stiffness.
PG  - 1177-1187
LID - 10.1007/s11605-023-05635-7 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Post-hepatectomy liver failure (PHLF) represents the major source of 
      mortality after liver resection (LR) in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients. 
      Child-Pugh (CP) score 5 is always considered to indicate a normal liver function 
      but represents a heterogeneous population with a considerable number suffering 
      from PHLF. The present study aimed to access the ability of liver stiffness (LS) 
      measured by two-dimensional shear wave elastography (2D-SWE) to predict PHLF in 
      HCC patients with a CP score of 5. METHODS: From August 2018 to May 2021, 146 HCC 
      patients with a CP score of 5 who underwent LR were reviewed. The patients were 
      randomly divided into training (n = 97) and validation (n = 49) groups. Logistic 
      analyses were conducted for the risk factors and a linear model was built to 
      predict the development of PHLF. The discrimination and calibration were assessed 
      in the training and validation cohorts by the areas under the receiver operating 
      characteristic curve (AUC). RESULTS: Analyses revealed that the minimum of LS 
      (Emin) higher than 8.05 (p = 0.006, OR = 4.59) and future liver remnant / 
      estimated total liver volume (FLR/eTLV) (p < 0.001, OR < 0.01) were independent 
      predictors of PHLF in HCC patients with CP score 5, and the AUC calculated by the 
      model based on them for differentiation of PHLF in the training and validation 
      group was 0.78 and 0.76, respectively. CONCLUSION: LS was associated with the 
      development of PHLF. A model combining Emin and FLR/eTLV showed proper ability in 
      predicting PHLF in HCC patients with a CP score of 5.

TI  - FDA Approval Summary: Tremelimumab in Combination with Durvalumab for the 
      Treatment of Patients with Unresectable Hepatocellular Carcinoma.
PG  - 269-273
LID - 10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-23-2124 [doi]
AB  - On October 21, 2022, the FDA approved tremelimumab (Imjudo) in combination with 
      durvalumab for adult patients with unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma. The 
      approval was based on the results from the HIMALAYA study, in which patients with 
      unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma who were naïve to previous systemic 
      treatment were randomly assigned to receive one of three study arms: tremelimumab 
      in combination with durvalumab (n = 393), durvalumab (n = 389), or sorafenib (n = 
      389). The primary objective of improvement in overall survival (OS) for 
      tremelimumab in combination with durvalumab compared with sorafenib met 
      statistical significance with a stratified HR of 0.78 [95% confidence interval 
      (CI), 0.66-0.92; P = 0.0035]. The median OS was 16.4 months (95% CI, 14.2-19.6) 
      with tremelimumab in combination with durvalumab and 13.8 months (95% CI, 
      12.3-16.1) with sorafenib. Adverse reactions occurring in ≥20% of patients 
      receiving tremelimumab in combination with durvalumab were rash, fatigue, 
      diarrhea, pruritus, musculoskeletal pain, and abdominal pain. The recommended 
      tremelimumab dose for patients weighing 30 kg or more is 300 mg, i.v., as a 
      single dose in combination with durvalumab 1,500 mg at cycle 1/day 1, followed by 
      durvalumab 1,500 mg, i.v., every 4 weeks. For those weighing less than 30 kg, the 
      recommended tremelimumab dose is 4 mg/kg, i.v., as a single dose in combination 
      with durvalumab 20 mg/kg, i.v., followed by durvalumab 20 mg/kg, i.v., every 4 
      weeks.

TI  - Phase 1 Randomized Trial of Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy Followed by 
      Nivolumab plus Ipilimumab or Nivolumab Alone in Advanced/Unresectable 
      Hepatocellular Carcinoma.

AB  - PURPOSE: Immunotherapy has emerged as a promising therapeutic option for advanced 
      or unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). However, survival remains poor 
      with only a subset of patients deriving benefit. This trial investigated the 
      safety and efficacy of stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) with 
      immunotherapy in HCC. METHODS AND MATERIALS: In this multicenter phase 1 
      randomized trial, patients with advanced or unresectable HCC received liver SBRT 
      (40 Gy in 5 fractions) followed by either nivolumab alone or nivolumab plus 
      ipilimumab. The primary endpoint was dose-limiting toxicity occurring within 6 
      months of SBRT. Secondary endpoints included overall response rate, 
      progression-free survival, overall survival (OS), distant disease control, and 
      local control of the irradiated tumor. Disease status and response endpoints were 
      assessed radiographically every 8 weeks until progression or initiation of 
      nonprotocol therapy. Response was determined using both RECIST (Response 
      Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors) 1.1 and iRECIST. RESULTS: Fourteen patients 
      were enrolled across 3 centers. Thirteen patients were evaluated for study 
      endpoints. The study was closed early because of slow accrual. The median 
      follow-up time was 42.7 months. Dose-limiting toxicities within 6 months occurred 
      in 2 (15.4%) of 13 patients: 1 of 6 patients in the nivolumab arm (16.7%; 90% 
      confidence interval [CI], 0.9%-58.2%) and 1 of 7 patients in the nivolumab plus 
      ipilimumab arm (14.3%; 90% CI, 0.7%-52.1%). Grade 3 adverse events occurred in 8 
      (61.6%), 5 (71.4%), and 3 (50.0%) patients in the overall nivolumab plus 
      ipilimumab and nivolumab cohorts. Grade 3 hepatotoxicity occurred in 4 (30.8%), 3 
      (42.9%), and 1 (16.7%) patients in the respective cohorts. Clinical outcomes 
      favored the nivolumab plus ipilimumab arm compared with nivolumab alone, 
      including an overall response rate of 57% (4 of 7 patients; 90% CI, 23%-87%) 
      versus 0% (0 of 6 patients; 90% CI, 0%-39%), median progression-free survival of 
      11.6 months (90% CI, 4.5 months to not reached) versus 2.7 months (90% CI, 
      1.3-4.7 months), and median OS of 41.6 months (90% CI, 4.5 months to not reached) 
      versus 4.7 months (90% CI, 2.0-16.2 months) (all P < .05). With combination 
      immunotherapy, 3-year OS was 57% (90% CI, 23%-81%), with 2 patients alive after 
      42.7 months without progression and negative PET. CONCLUSIONS: In this first 
      prospective trial investigating the combination of SBRT and immunotherapy for 
      HCC, multimodal therapy demonstrated acceptable safety. SBRT with nivolumab plus 
      ipilimumab compared favorably to outcomes of immunotherapy alone and warrants 
      further investigation.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The high recurrent rate after liver transplantation (LT) remains a 
      clinical challenge, especially for those exceeding the Milan criteria (MC) and 
      with high RETREAT scores. Therefore, the authors aim to investigate whether 
      neoadjuvant systemic therapy allows safely administered and effectively reduces 
      post-LT recurrence for those patients. METHODS: In this prospective, randomized, 
      open-label, pilot study, patients with HCC exceeding the MC were randomly 
      assigned to PLENTY or control group before LT. The primary endpoint of the study 
      was the recurrence-free survival after LT. RESULTS: Twenty-two patients were 
      enrolled and randomly assigned: 11 to the PLENTY group and 11 to the control 
      group. The 30-month tumor-specific RFS was 37.5% in the PLENTY group and 12.5% in 
      the control group. The 12-month tumor-specific RFS after LT was significantly 
      improved in the PLENTY group (87.5%) compared to the control group (37.5%) ( P 
      =0·0022). The objective response rate in the PLENTY group was 30 and 60% when 
      determined by RECIST 1.1 and mRECIST, respectively. Six patients (60%) had 
      significant tumor necrosis, including three (30%) who had complete tumor necrosis 
      at histopathology. No acute allograft rejection after LT occurred in the PLENTY 
      and Control group. CONCLUSION: Neoadjuvant pembrolizumab plus lenvatinib before 
      LT appears to be safe and feasible, associated with significantly better RFS for 
      patients exceeding the MC. Despite the limitations of small sample size, this is 
      the first RCT to evaluate neoadjuvant PD-1 blockade combined with tyrosine kinase 
      inhibitors in LT recipients, the results of this study will inform future 
      research.

AB  - IMPORTANCE: Whether stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) as a bridge to liver 
      transplant for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is effective and safe is still 
      unknown. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the feasibility of SBRT before deceased donor 
      liver transplant (DDLT) for previously untreated unresectable HCC. DESIGN, 
      SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: In this phase 2 nonrandomized controlled trial 
      conducted between June 1, 2015, and October 18, 2019, 32 eligible patients within 
      UCSF (University of California, San Francisco) criteria underwent dual-tracer 
      (18F-fluorodeoxyglucose and 11C-acetate [ACC]) positron emission tomography with 
      computed tomography (PET-CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with gadoxetate 
      followed by SBRT of 35 to 50 Gy in 5 fractions, and the same imaging afterward 
      while awaiting DDLT. Statistical analysis was performed on an intention-to-treat 
      basis between October 1 and 31, 2023. INTERVENTION: Patients received SBRT 
      followed by DDLT when matched deceased donor grafts were available. MAIN OUTCOMES 
      AND MEASURES: Coprimary end points were progression-free survival (PFS) and 
      objective response rates (ORRs) by the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid 
      Tumors, version 1.1 (RECIST 1.1), modified RECIST (mRECIST), and PET Response 
      Criteria in Solid Tumors (PERCIST). Secondary end points were local control rate, 
      overall survival (OS), and safety. RESULTS: A total of 32 patients (median age, 
      59 years [IQR, 54-63 years]; 22 men [68.8%]) with 56 lesions received SBRT. After 
      a median follow-up of 74.6 months (IQR, 40.1-102.9 months), the median PFS was 
      17.6 months (95% CI, 6.6-28.6 months), and the median OS was 60.5 months (95% CI, 
      29.7-91.2 months). The 5-year PFS was 39.9% (95% CI, 19.9%-59.9%), and the 5-year 
      OS was 51.3% (95% CI, 31.7%-70.9%). In terms of number of patients, ORRs were 
      62.5% ([n = 20] 95% CI, 54.2%-68.7%) by RECIST 1.1, 71.9% ([n = 23] 95% CI, 
      63.7%-79.0%) by mRECIST, and 78.1% ([n = 25] 95% CI, 73.2%-86.7%) by PERCIST. In 
      terms of number of lesions, ORRs were 75.0% ([n = 42] 95% CI, 61.6%-80.8%) by 
      RECIST 1.1, 83.9% ([n = 47] 95% CI, 74.7%-90.6%) by mRECIST, and 87.5% ([n = 49] 
      95% CI, 81.3%-98.6%) by PERCIST. Twenty patients with 36 lesions received DDLT, 
      of whom 15 patients (75.0%) with 21 lesions (58.3%) exhibited pathologic complete 
      response. Multivariable analyses revealed that pretreatment metabolic tumor 
      volume (MTV) based on ACC (hazard ratio [HR], 1.06 [95% CI, 1.01-1.10]; P = .01) 
      and complete metabolic response (CMR) by PERCIST (HR, 0.31 [95% CI, 0.10-0.96]; 
      P = .04) were associated with PFS, while pretreatment MTV based on ACC (HR, 1.07 
      [95% CI, 1.03-1.16]; P = .01), total lesion activity based on ACC (HR, 1.01 [95% 
      CI, 1.00-1.02]; P = .02), and CMR by PERCIST (HR, 0.21 [95% CI, 0.07-0.73]; 
      P = .01) were associated with OS. Toxic effects associated with SBRT were 
      reported for 9 patients (28.1%), with 1 grade 3 event. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: 
      This phase 2 nonrandomized controlled trial demonstrated promising survival and 
      safety outcomes of SBRT before DDLT for unresectable HCC. Future randomized 
      clinical trials are warranted.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) prognosis involves multiple clinical 
      factors. Although nomogram models targeting various clinical factors have been 
      reported in early and locally advanced HCC, there are currently few studies on 
      complete and effective prognostic nomogram models for stage IV HCC patients. This 
      study aims to creat nomograms for cancer-specific survival (CSS) in patients at 
      stage IV of HCC and developing a web predictive nomogram model to predict patient 
      prognosis and guide individualized treatment. METHODS: Clinicopathological 
      information on stage IV of HCC between January, 2010 and December, 2015 was 
      collected from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database. 
      The patients at stage IV of HCC were categorized into IVA (without distant 
      metastases) and IVB (with distant metastases) subgroups based on the presence of 
      distant metastasis, and then the patients from both IVA and IVB subgroups were 
      randomly divided into the training and validation cohorts in a 7꞉3 ratio. 
      Univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses were used to analyze the 
      independent risk factors that significantly affected CSS in the training cohort, 
      and constructed nomogram models separately for stage IVA and stage IVB patients 
      based on relevant independent risk factors. Two nomogram's accuracy and 
      discrimination were evaluated by receiver operator characteristic (ROC) curves 
      and calibration curves. Furthermore, web-based nomogram models were developed 
      specifically for stage IVA and stage IVB HCC patients by R software. A decision 
      analysis curve (DCA) was used to evaluate the clinical utility of the web-based 
      nomogram models. RESULTS: A total of 3 060 patients were included in this study, 
      of which 883 were in stage IVA, and 2 177 were in stage IVB. Based on 
      multivariate analysis results, tumor size, alpha-fetoprotein (AFP), T stage, 
      histological grade, surgery, radiotherapy, and chemotherapy were independent 
      prognostic factors for patients with stage IVA of HCC; and tumor size, AFP, T 
      stage, N stage, histological grade, lung metastasis, surgery, radiotherapy, and 
      chemotherapy were independent prognostic factors for patients with stage IVB HCC. 
      In stage IVA patients, the 3-, 6-, 9-, 12-, 15-, and 18-month areas under the ROC 
      curves for the training cohort were 0.823, 0.800, 0.772, 0.784, 0.784, and 0.786, 
      respectively; and the 3-, 6-, 9-, 12-, 15-, and 18-month areas under the ROC 
      curves for the validation cohort were 0.793, 0.764, 0.739, 0.773, 0.798, and 
      0.799, respectively. In stage IVB patients, the 3-, 6-, 9-, and 12-month areas 
      under the ROC curves for the training cohort were 0.756, 0.750, 0.755, and 0.743, 
      respectively; and the 3-, 6-, 9-, and 12-month areas under the ROC curves for the 
      validation cohort were 0.744, 0.747, 0.775, and 0.779, respectively; showing that 
      the nomograms had an excellent predictive ability. The calibration curves showed 
      a good consistency between the predictions and actual observations. CONCLUSIONS: 
      Predictive nomogram models for CSS in stage IVA and IVB HCC patients are 
      developed and validated based on the SEER database, which might be used for 
      clinicians to predict the prognosis, implement individualized treatment, and 
      follow up those patients.

AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: Validated surrogate endpoints for overall survival (OS) are 
      important for expediting the clinical study and drug-development processes. 
      Herein, we aimed to validate objective response as an independent predictor of OS 
      in individuals with unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) receiving 
      systemic anti-angiogenic therapy. METHODS: We investigated the association 
      between objective response (investigator-assessed mRECIST, independent radiologic 
      review [IRR] mRECIST and RECIST v1.1) and OS in REFLECT, a phase III study of 
      lenvatinib vs. sorafenib. We conducted landmark analyses (Simon-Makuch) of OS by 
      objective response at 2, 4, and 6 months after randomization. RESULTS: Median OS 
      was 21.6 months (95% CI 18.6-24.5) for responders (investigator-assessed mRECIST) 
      vs. 11.9 months (95% CI 10.7-12.8) for non-responders (hazard ratio [HR] 0.61; 
      95% CI 0.49-0.76; p <0.001). Objective response by IRR per mRECIST and RECIST 
      v1.1 supported the association with OS (HR 0.61; 95% CI 0.51-0.72; p <0.001 and 
      HR 0.50; 95% CI 0.39-0.65; p <0.001, respectively). OS was significantly 
      prolonged for responders vs. non-responders (investigator-assessed mRECIST) at 
      the 2-month (HR 0.61; 95% CI 0.49-0.76; p <0.001), 4-month (HR 0.63; 95% CI 
      0.51-0.80; p <0.001), and 6-month (HR 0.68; 95% CI 0.54-0.86; p <0.001) 
      landmarks. Results were similar when assessed by IRR, with both mRECIST and 
      RECIST v1.1. An exploratory multivariate Cox regression analysis identified 
      objective response by investigator-assessed mRECIST (HR 0.55; 95% CI 0.44-0.68; 
      p <0.0001) and IRR-assessed RECIST v1.1 (HR 0.49; 95% CI, 0.38-0.64; p <0.0001) 
      as independent predictors of OS in individuals with unresectable HCC. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Objective response was an independent predictor of OS in individuals 
      with unresectable HCC in REFLECT; additional studies are needed to confirm 
      surrogacy. Participants achieving a complete or partial response by mRECIST or 
      RECIST v1.1 had significantly longer survival vs. those with 
      stable/progressive/non-evaluable disease. GOV NUMBER: NCT01761266. IMPACT AND 
      IMPLICATIONS: This analysis of data taken from a completed clinical trial 
      (REFLECT) looked for any link between objective response and overall survival 
      time in individuals with unresectable HCC receiving anti-angiogenic treatments. 
      Significantly longer median overall survival was found for responders (21.6 
      months) vs. non-responders (11.9 months). Overall survival was also significantly 
      longer for responders vs. non-responders (based on objective response status at 
      2, 4, and 6 months) in the landmark analysis. Our results indicate that objective 
      response is an independent predictor of overall survival in this setting, 
      confirming its validity as a rapid marker of efficacy that can be applied in 
      phase II trials; however, further validation is required to determine is validity 
      for other systemic treatments (e.g. immunotherapies), or as a surrogate of 
      overall survival.

TI  - Nonadherence to oral cancer chemotherapy in hepatocellular carcinoma: prevalence 
      and predictive factors in Vietnam.

AB  - PURPOSE: Standard oral cancer chemotherapy (OCT) or targeted therapy (OTT) has 
      expanded the treatment methods for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). However, its 
      principal nonadherence causes a reduction in efficacy. We aimed to evaluate the 
      status of nonadherence and influencing factors among outpatient patients with 
      HCC. PATIENTS AND METHODS: In 2021, a prospective observational study was 
      conducted on 384 patients with either old or newly diagnosed HCC treated with 
      OTT. Nonadherence to OCT was determined using the eight-item Morisky Medication 
      Adherence Scale, with a score < 6 points. The patients were finished with a 
      six-month follow-up investigation by questionnaires. RESULTS: 54,8% of HCC 
      outpatients were nonadherent to OCT, with a mean Morisky score of 5.19. They 
      dropped out of the treatment mainly because of drug side effects, such as fatigue 
      (72.4%), hand-foot syndrome (42.7%), diarrhea (38.3%), nausea (25%), insomnia 
      (24.7%), abdominal pain (12%), and anxiety about these adverse events (65.9%). 
      Additionally, financial difficulties and low relative copayments were 
      significantly correlated with the noncompliant treatment of patients (OR = 2.29, 
      95% CI = 1.32-3.98, P = 0.003; OR = 4.36, 95% CI = 0.95-19.93, P = 0.039, 
      respectively). Moreover, inadequate individual information about the clinical 
      course, the art of treatment, and medication usage instructions were suggestive 
      barriers to adherence to treatment (OR = 1.96, 95% CI = 1.08-3.55, P = 0.024; 
      OR = 1.86, 95% CI = 1.1-3.14, P = 0.02; OR = 2.34, 95% CI = 1.29-4.26, P = 0.004, 
      respectively). Finally, a low level of trust in doctors was an essential factor 
      in nonadherence (Mean of the Anderson Trust in Physician Scale scores counted 
      38.12 vs. 43.97, respectively for non-adherence vs. adherence, P = 0.00001). 
      CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests a high rate of primary nonadherence to standard 
      oral targeted therapy among HCC outpatient patients because of drug side effects, 
      patient awareness of treatment, and lack of confidence in healthcare providers. 
      Close supervision, proper medication instructions, appropriate dosage reductions, 
      and comprehensive patient counseling might be necessary to control nonadherence.

TI  - Cabozantinib plus atezolizumab versus sorafenib for advanced hepatocellular 
      carcinoma (COSMIC-312): final results of a randomised phase 3 study.
PG  - 310-322

AB  - BACKGROUND: The aim of the COSMIC-312 trial was to evaluate cabozantinib plus 
      atezolizumab versus sorafenib in patients with previously untreated advanced 
      hepatocellular carcinoma. In the initial analysis, cabozantinib plus atezolizumab 
      significantly prolonged progression-free survival versus sorafenib. Here, we 
      report the pre-planned final overall survival analysis and updated safety and 
      efficacy results following longer follow-up. METHODS: COSMIC-312 was an 
      open-label, randomised, phase 3 study done across 178 centres in 32 countries. 
      Patients aged 18 years or older with previously untreated advanced hepatocellular 
      carcinoma were eligible. Patients must have had measurable disease per Response 
      Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumours version 1.1 (RECIST 1.1), and adequate 
      marrow and organ function, including Child-Pugh class A liver function; those 
      with fibrolamellar carcinoma, sarcomatoid hepatocellular carcinoma, or combined 
      hepatocellular cholangiocarcinoma were ineligible. Patients were randomly 
      assigned (2:1:1) using a web-based interactive response system to a combination 
      of oral cabozantinib 40 mg once daily plus intravenous atezolizumab 1200 mg every 
      3 weeks, oral sorafenib 400 mg twice daily, or oral single-agent cabozantinib 60 
      mg once daily. Randomisation was stratified by disease aetiology, geographical 
      region, and presence of extrahepatic disease or macrovascular invasion. Dual 
      primary endpoints were for cabozantinib plus atezolizumab versus sorafenib: 
      progression-free survival per RECIST 1.1, as assessed by a blinded independent 
      radiology committee, in the first 372 randomly assigned patients (previously 
      reported) and overall survival in all patients randomly assigned to cabozantinib 
      plus atezolizumab or sorafenib. The secondary endpoint was progression-free 
      survival in all patients randomly assigned to cabozantinib versus sorafenib. 
      Outcomes in all randomly assigned patients, including final overall survival, are 
      presented. Safety was assessed in all randomly assigned patients who received at 
      least one dose of study drug. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, 
      NCT03755791. FINDINGS: Between Dec 7, 2018, and Aug 27, 2020, 432 patients were 
      randomly assigned to combination treatment, 217 to sorafenib, and 188 to 
      single-agent cabozantinib, and included in all efficacy analyses. 704 (84%) 
      patients were male and 133 (16%) were female. 824 of these patients received at 
      least one dose of study treatment and were included in the safety population. 
      Median follow-up was 22·1 months (IQR 19·3-24·8). Median overall survival was 
      16·5 months (96% CI 14·5-18·7) for the combination treatment group and 15·5 
      months (12·2-20·0) for the sorafenib group (hazard ratio [HR] 0·98 [0·78-1·24]; 
      stratified log-rank p=0·87). Median progression-free survival was 6·9 months (99% 
      CI 5·7-8·2) for the combination treatment group, 4·3 months (2·9-6·1) for the 
      sorafenib group, and 5·8 months (99% CI 5·4-8·2) for the single-agent 
      cabozantinib group (HR 0·74 [0·56-0·97] for combination treatment vs sorafenib; 
      HR 0·78 [99% CI 0·56-1·09], p=0·05, for single-agent cabozantinib vs sorafenib). 
      Grade 3 or 4 adverse events occurred in 281 (66%) of 429 patients in the 
      combination treatment group, 100 (48%) of 207 patients in the sorafenib group, 
      and 108 (57%) of 188 patients in the single-agent cabozantinib group; the most 
      common were hypertension (37 [9%] vs 17 [8%] vs 23 [12%]), palmar-plantar 
      erythrodysaesthesia (36 [8%] vs 18 [9%] vs 16 [9%]), aspartate aminotransferase 
      increased (42 [10%] vs eight [4%] vs 17 [9%]), and alanine aminotransferase 
      increased (40 [9%] vs six [3%] vs 13 [7%]). Serious adverse events occurred in 
      223 (52%) patients in the combination treatment group, 84 (41%) patients in the 
      sorafenib group, and 87 (46%) patients in the single agent cabozantinib group. 
      Treatment-related deaths occurred in six (1%) patients in the combination 
      treatment group (encephalopathy, hepatic failure, drug-induced liver injury, 
      oesophageal varices haemorrhage, multiple organ dysfunction syndrome, and tumour 
      lysis syndrome), one (<1%) in the sorafenib group (general physical health 
      deterioration), and four (2%) in the single-agent cabozantinib group (asthenia, 
      gastrointestinal haemorrhage, sepsis, and gastric perforation). INTERPRETATION: 
      First-line cabozantinib plus atezolizumab did not improve overall survival versus 
      sorafenib in patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma. The 
      progression-free survival benefit of the combination versus sorafenib was 
      maintained, with no new safety signals. FUNDING: Exelixis and Ipsen.

TI  - Spleen to non-cancerous liver volume ratio predicts liver cirrhosis in 
      hepatocellular carcinoma patients.
PG  - 543-553
LID - 10.1007/s00261-022-03727-7 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: To investigate the performance of spleen to non-cancerous liver volume 
      ratio (STnLR) for diagnosing liver cirrhosis in patients with hepatocellular 
      carcinoma (HCC) during preoperative evaluation. METHODS: Patients were randomly 
      divided into experiment group and validation group. Patients were grouped into 
      cirrhosis group and non-cirrhosis group according to Scheuer staging. Patients' 
      routine image data were reconstructed using a three-dimensional system. STnLR, 
      spleen to liver volume ratio (STLR), spleen volume, aspartate aminotransferase to 
      platelet ratio index (APRI), and fibrosis index based on the four factors (FIB-4) 
      were calculated. Correlations between indices and cirrhosis were measured by 
      Spearman correlation analysis. Diagnostic performance was assessed and compared 
      using receiver operating characteristic analysis. Accuracies of the models were 
      analyzed in validation group. RESULTS: No statistical difference in demographic 
      and clinical characteristics was observed between groups. In experiment group, 
      STnLR had the strongest correlation (r = 0.5399, P < 0.0001), and STLR, spleen 
      volume, APRI, and FIB-4 had moderate correlations (r = 0.4583, 0.4123, 0.3648, 
      and 0.3405, P < 0.0001, < 0.0001, < 0.0001, and = 0.0002) with liver cirrhosis 
      stage. AUROC of STnLR (0.8326) was not statistically higher than that for spleen 
      volume (0.7542, P = 0.09832) and STLR (0.8046, P = 0.3034), but was significantly 
      higher than that for APRI (0.7099, P = 0.02046) and FIB-4 (0.7294, P = 0.03987). 
      In validation group, STnLR showed the highest AUROC value (0.8538) and highest 
      Youden index (0.5869) among all models. CONCLUSION: STnLR is an accurate and 
      stable volumetric model to diagnose hepatic cirrhosis in the HCC population, 
      which is superior to APRI and FIB-4.

TI  - Phase 1 trial of navitoclax and sorafenib in patients with relapsed or refractory 
      solid tumors with hepatocellular carcinoma expansion cohort.
PG  - 127-135
LID - 10.1007/s10637-024-01420-8 [doi]
AB  - Navitoclax (ABT-263) is an oral BCL2 homology-3 mimetic that binds with high 
      affinity to pro-survival BCL2 proteins, resulting in apoptosis. Sorafenib, an 
      oral multi kinase inhibitor also promotes apoptosis and inhibits tumor 
      angiogenesis. The efficacy of either agent alone is limited; however, preclinical 
      studies demonstrate synergy with the combination of navitoclax and sorafenib. In 
      this phase 1 study, we evaluated the combination of navitoclax and sorafenib in a 
      dose escalation cohort of patients with refractory solid tumors, with an 
      expansion cohort in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Maximum tolerated dose (MTD) 
      was determined using the continual reassessment method. Navitoclax and sorafenib 
      were administered continuously on days 1 through 21 of 21-day cycles. Ten 
      patients were enrolled in the dose escalation cohort and 15 HCC patients were 
      enrolled in the expansion cohort. Two dose levels were tested, and the MTD was 
      navitoclax 150 mg daily plus sorafenib 400 mg twice daily. Among all patients, 
      the most common grade 3 toxicity was thrombocytopenia (5 patients, 20%): there 
      were no grade 4 or 5 toxicities. Patients received a median of 2 cycles (range 
      1-36 cycles) and all patients were off study treatment at data cut off. Six 
      patients in the expansion cohort had stable disease, and there were no partial or 
      complete responses. Drug-drug interaction between navitoclax and sorafenib was 
      not observed. The combination of navitoclax and sorafenib did not increase 
      induction of apoptosis compared with navitoclax alone. Navitoclax plus sorafenib 
      is tolerable but showed limited efficacy in the HCC expansion cohort. These 
      findings do not support further development of this combination for the treatment 
      of advanced HCC. This phase I trial was conducted under ClinicalTrials.gov 
      registry number NCT01364051.

      single-arm clinical trial.
PG  - 1238667

AB  - PURPOSE: This multicenter, open-label, phase Ib/II study aimed to assess the 
      efficacy and safety of cadonilimab, a humanized, tetravalent, bispecific antibody 
      plus lenvatinib in first-line treatment of advanced hepatocellular carcinoma 
      (aHCC). METHODS: Patients with histologically confirmed aHCC were included to 
      receive either 6 mg/kg cadonilimab every 2 weeks plus lenvatinib (cohort A) or 15 
      mg/kg cadonilimab every 3 weeks plus lenvatinib (cohort B). The primary endpoint 
      was objective response rate (ORR) by RECIST v1.1, while the secondary endpoints 
      were safety, progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), disease 
      control rate (DCR), duration of response (DoR), and time to response (TTR). 
      RESULTS: A total of 59 patients were enrolled (31 in cohort A and 28 in cohort 
      B). The median follow-up time was 27.4 months as of the data cutoff date (July 
      28, 2023). The ORR in cohort A was 35.5% (95% CI: 19.2, 54.6) and that in cohort 
      B was 35.7% (95% CI: 18.6, 55.9), and the median DoR was 13.6 months (95% CI: 
      4.14, NE) and 13.67 months (95% CI: 3.52, NE), respectively. The median PFS was 
      8.6 months (95% CI: 5.2, 15.2) and 9.8 months (95% CI: 6.9, 15.2), respectively. 
      The median OS was 27.1 months (95% C: 15.7, NE) for cohort A, while it was not 
      reached for cohort B. Grade ≥ 3 treatment-related adverse events (TRAEs) were 
      reported in 66.1% of patients, with serious TRAEs occurring in 39.0% of cases. 
      Decreased platelet count (47.5%), proteinuria (45.8%), hypertension (44.1%), and 
      white blood cell count (44.1%) were the most common TRAEs. CONCLUSION: This novel 
      combination therapy showed promising efficacy and manageable toxicity that could 
      provide an option in first-line setting of aHCC. CLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRATION:

TI  - Lenvatinib, Toripalimab plus FOLFOX Chemotherapy in Hepatocellular Carcinoma 
      Patients with Extrahepatic Metastasis: A Biomolecular Exploratory, Phase II Trial 
      (LTSC).
PG  - 5104-5115
LID - 10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-23-0060 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: To investigate the efficacy, safety, and biomarkers of systemic 
      chemotherapy with oxaliplatin, leucovorin, and 5-fluorouracil (FOLFOX) in 
      combination with lenvatinib and toripalimab as the first-line treatment for 
      advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) with extrahepatic metastasis. PATIENTS 
      AND METHODS: In this biomolecular exploratory, phase II trial, eligible patients 
      underwent the triple combination therapy of lenvatinib, toripalimab, plus FOLFOX 
      chemotherapy. Primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS) rate at 6 
      months by RECIST v1.1. Single-nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq) of tumor biopsy 
      samples was performed for exploratory biomarker analyses. RESULTS: Between 
      November 19, 2019, and July 4, 2021, 30 patients were enrolled. The primary 
      endpoint was a 6-month PFS rate of 66.7%, with a median PFS of 9.73 months [95% 
      confidence interval (CI), 2.89-16.58]. The median overall survival (OS) was 14.63 
      months (95% CI, 11.77-17.50), with an objective response rate of 43.3%. 
      Twenty-four (80.0%) patients exhibited high-risk features, among whom the median 
      OS and PFS were 13.7 months (95% CI, 9.24-18.16) and 8.3 months (95% CI, 
      3.02-13.58), respectively. The most common adverse events were neutropenia, and 
      increased aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase levels. 
      Exploratory analyses of snRNA-seq profiles suggested that patients with higher 
      abundance of tumor-infiltrating immune cells were more likely to benefit from 
      this combination. In addition, two subtypes of hepatocytes (AKR1C2+ and CFHR4+ 
      malignant hepatocytes) were associated with reduced clinical benefits. 
      CONCLUSIONS: FOLFOX chemotherapy in combination with lenvatinib and toripalimab 
      showed promising antitumor activity with manageable toxicities in advanced HCC 
      with extrahepatic metastasis. AKR1C2+ and CFHR4+ hepatocyte subtypes may be 
      predictive biomarkers of resistance to the combination therapy.

LID - e2332579
AB  - IMPORTANCE: Liver cancer, primarily hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), is the third 
      leading cause of cancer deaths worldwide. Although some studies have proposed 
      that antidepressants may have apoptotic effects on cancer, no study has examined 
      the association between antidepressant use and HCC prognosis. OBJECTIVE: To 
      investigate the association between antidepressant use and mortality risk in 
      patients with HCC. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This population-based 
      cohort study analyzed Taiwan's National Health Insurance Research Database, which 
      covers 99% of Taiwan's population and includes comprehensive medical information. 
      Patients with a new diagnosis of HCC between 1999 and 2017 were identified. 
      Analysis took place in June 2023. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: All patients with 
      HCC were followed up until 2018 to measure overall and cancer-specific mortality. 
      To examine whether the timing of antidepressant use influenced the association 
      with mortality, antidepressant use was examined before and after HCC diagnosis. 
      Cox proportional hazards regression was performed to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) 
      and the 95% CIs for the association between antidepressant use and overall 
      mortality and cancer-specific mortality. RESULTS: The study cohort comprised 
      308 938 participants, primarily consisting of older individuals (131 991 [42.7%] 
      were aged ≥65 years) with a higher proportion of male individuals (202 589 
      [65.6%]). Antidepressant use before the diagnosis of HCC was not associated with 
      lower risks of overall mortality (adjusted HR, 1.10; 95% CI, 1.08-1.12) and 
      cancer-specific mortality (adjusted HR, 1.06; 95% CI, 0.96-1.17). However, 
      antidepressant use after a diagnosis of HCC was associated with a lower risk of 
      overall mortality (adjusted HR, 0.69; 95% CI, 0.68-0.70) and cancer-specific 
      mortality (adjusted HR, 0.63; 95% CI, 0.59-0.68). The observed associations were 
      consistent across subgroups with different antidepressant classes and 
      comorbidities, including hepatitis B virus or hepatitis C virus infection, liver 
      cirrhosis, and alcohol use disorders. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Based on this 
      nationwide cohort study, postdiagnosis antidepressant use may be associated with 
      lower mortality in patients with HCC. Further randomized clinical trial 
      evaluation should be considered.

TI  - National Liver Cancer Screening Trial (TRACER) study protocol.
LID - 10.1097/HC9.0000000000000565 [doi]
LID - e0565
AB  - BACKGROUND: Professional guidelines recommend HCC screening in at-risk patients 
      using semi-annual ultrasound with or without alpha-fetoprotein (AFP); however, 
      this strategy has limited effectiveness due to low adherence and sensitivity. 
      Increasing data support the potential role of blood-based biomarker panels, which 
      could improve both aspects. The biomarker panel GALAD, comprised of sex, age, and 
      3 blood biomarkers (AFP, AFP-L3, and des-carboxy prothrombin des-carboxy 
      prothrombin), has shown high sensitivity and specificity in biomarker phase II 
      (case-control) and phase III (retrospective cohort) validation studies. However, 
      prospective validation in a large phase IV biomarker clinical utility trial is 
      necessary before its adoption in practice. METHODS: The National Liver Cancer 
      Screening Trial is an adaptive pragmatic randomized phase IV trial, which began 
      enrollment in January 2024, comparing ultrasound-based versus biomarker-based 
      screening in 5500 patients with chronic hepatitis B infection or cirrhosis from 
      any etiology. Eligible patients are randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to 
      semi-annual screening with ultrasound ± alpha-fetoprotein (arm A) or semi-annual 
      screening with GALAD (arm B). Randomization is stratified by enrollment site, 
      liver disease severity (per Child-Pugh class), liver disease etiology (viral, 
      nonviral, and noncirrhotic HBV), and sex. Patients are being recruited from 15 
      sites (a mix of tertiary care academic referral centers, safety-net health 
      systems, and large community health systems) over a 3-year period, and the 
      primary endpoint, reduction in late-stage HCC, will be assessed at the end of 
      year 5.5. DISCUSSION: The results of this trial will inform the best strategy for 
      HCC screening and early-stage detection in patients with chronic liver diseases. 
      If GALAD shows superiority, HCC screening would primarily shift from an 
      ultrasound-based strategy to the adoption of the biomarker panel. TRIAL 
      REGISTRATION: NCT06084234. TRIAL STATUS: The TRACER Study is actively enrolling.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Integration of symptom and palliative care for people with advanced 
      cancer is established in many tumour types, but its role in people with 
      hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) has not been clearly defined. This study aims to 
      evaluate the clinical and cost effectiveness of an intervention involving a suite 
      of strategies designed to assess and treat palliative care symptoms and needs in 
      adult outpatients with HCC attending four New South Wales (NSW) metropolitan 
      tertiary hospitals. METHODS: This trial will use a pragmatic cluster-based 
      randomised-controlled design, with ambulatory HCC services as the clusters. HCC 
      patients will be recruited if they have Barcelona Clinical Liver Cancer (BCLC) 
      stage A disease with active tumour or a current or prior diagnosis of BCLC stage 
      B or C disease regardless of tumour activity. Patients with BCLC stage D disease 
      will be excluded as palliative care is the standard of care (SOC) in this group. 
      Cluster sites will be randomised to the study intervention or control where 
      patients are managed according to SOC. All participants will complete the 
      liver-specific Edmonton Symptom Assessment Scale (ESAS) and European Organisation 
      for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire at regular 
      ambulatory clinic appointments. At intervention sites, patients scoring ≥ 5 on 
      any liver-specific ESAS symptom will be referred to palliative care physicians 
      for consultation. The primary clinical outcome will be improvement in all 
      symptoms scored ≥ 5 on the liver-specific ESAS by 50% within 3 months and the 
      primary implementation outcome will recording the liver-specific ESAS in ≥ 80% of 
      all participants attending clinic appointments. Caregivers of patients enrolled 
      in the trial will be invited to perform Carer Support Needs Assessment Tool at 
      each appointment. DISCUSSION: This trial will inform if earlier palliative care 
      involvement significantly reduces the symptom burden associated with HCC. If 
      found to be effective, earlier implementation of palliative care consultation 
      should be included in HCC treatment guidelines. TRIAL REGISTRATION: 
      ACTRN12623000010695. Registered on September 1, 2023.

TI  - Longitudinal trends in causes of death among adults with HIV on antiretroviral 
      therapy in Europe and North America from 1996 to 2020: a collaboration of cohort 
      studies.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Mortality rates among people with HIV have fallen since 1996 
      following the widespread availability of effective antiretroviral therapy (ART). 
      Patterns of cause-specific mortality are evolving as the population with HIV 
      ages. We aimed to investigate longitudinal trends in cause-specific mortality 
      among people with HIV starting ART in Europe and North America. METHODS: In this 
      collaborative observational cohort study, we used data from 17 European and North 
      American HIV cohorts contributing data to the Antiretroviral Therapy Cohort 
      Collaboration. We included data for people with HIV who started ART between 1996 
      and 2020 at the age of 16 years or older. Causes of death were classified into a 
      single cause by both a clinician and an algorithm if International Classification 
      of Diseases, Ninth Revision or Tenth Revision data were available, or 
      independently by two clinicians. Disagreements were resolved through panel 
      discussion. We used Poisson models to compare cause-specific mortality rates 
      during the calendar periods 1996-99, 2000-03, 2004-07, 2008-11, 2012-15, and 
      2016-20, adjusted for time-updated age, CD4 count, and whether the individual was 
      ART-naive at the start of each period. FINDINGS: Among 189 301 people with HIV 
      included in this study, 16 832 (8·9%) deaths were recorded during 1 519 200 
      person-years of follow-up. 13 180 (78·3%) deaths were classified by cause: the 
      most common causes were AIDS (4203 deaths; 25·0%), non-AIDS non-hepatitis 
      malignancy (2311; 13·7%), and cardiovascular or heart-related (1403; 8·3%) 
      mortality. The proportion of deaths due to AIDS declined from 49% during 1996-99 
      to 16% during 2016-20. Rates of all-cause mortality per 1000 person-years 
      decreased from 16·8 deaths (95% CI 15·4-18·4) during 1996-99 to 7·9 deaths 
      (7·6-8·2) during 2016-20. Rates of all-cause mortality declined with time: the 
      average adjusted mortality rate ratio per calendar period was 0·85 (95% CI 
      0·84-0·86). Rates of cause-specific mortality also declined: the most pronounced 
      reduction was for AIDS-related mortality (0·81; 0·79-0·83). There were also 
      reductions in rates of cardiovascular-related (0·83, 0·79-0·87), liver-related 
      (0·88, 0·84-0·93), non-AIDS infection-related (0·91, 0·86-0·96), 
      non-AIDS-non-hepatocellular carcinoma malignancy-related (0·94, 0·90-0·97), and 
      suicide or accident-related mortality (0·89, 0·82-0·95). Mortality rates among 
      people who acquired HIV through injecting drug use increased in women (1·07, 
      1·00-1·14) and decreased slightly in men (0·96, 0·93-0·99). INTERPRETATION: 
      Reductions of most major causes of death, particularly AIDS-related deaths among 
      people with HIV on ART, were not seen for all subgroups. Interventions targeted 
      at high-risk groups, substance use, and comorbidities might further increase life 
      expectancy in people with HIV towards that in the general population. FUNDING: US

TI  - Tumor burden score-AFP-albumin-bilirubin grade score predicts the survival of 
      patients with hepatocellular carcinoma after liver resection.
PG  - 250
LID - 10.1007/s00423-023-02993-3 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: There is little information regarding the overall survival (OS) 
      predictive ability of the combination of tumor burden score (TBS), α-fetoprotein 
      (AFP), and albumin-bilirubin (ALBI) grade for patients with hepatocellular 
      carcinoma (HCC). Here, we aimed to develop a model including TBS, AFP, and ALBI 
      grade to predict HCC patient OS following liver resection. METHODS: Patients (N = 
      1556) from six centers were randomly divided 1:1 into training and validation 
      sets. The X-Tile software was used to determine the optimal cutoff values. The 
      time-dependent area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) was 
      calculated to assess the prognostic ability of the different models. RESULTS: In 
      the training set, tumor differentiation, TBS, AFP, ALBI grade, and Barcelona 
      Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC) stage were independently related to OS. According to 
      the coefficient values of TBS, AFP, and ALBI grade, we developed the TBS-AFP-ALBI 
      (TAA) score using a simplified point system (0, 2 for low/high TBS, 0, 1 for 
      low/high AFP and 0,1 for ALBI grade 1/2). Patients were further divided into low 
      TAA (TAA ≤ 1), medium TAA (TAA = 2-3), and high TAA (TAA= 4) groups. TAA scores 
      (low: referent; medium, HR = 1.994, 95% CI = 1.492-2.666; high, HR = 2.413, 95% 
      CI = 1.630-3.573) were independently associated with patient survival in the 
      validation set. The TAA scores showed higher AUROCs than BCLC stage for the 
      prediction of 1-, 3-, and 5-year OS in both the training and validation sets. 
      CONCLUSION: TAA is a simple score that has better OS prediction performance than 
      the BCLC stage in predicting OS for HCC patients after liver resection.

TI  - Contrast-enhanced US Evaluation of Hepatocellular Carcinoma Response to 
      Chemoembolization: A Prospective Multicenter Trial.

AB  - Background Contrast-enhanced (CE) US has been studied for use in the detection of 
      residual viable hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) after locoregional therapy, but 
      multicenter data are lacking. Purpose To compare two-dimensional (2D) and 
      three-dimensional (3D) CE US diagnostic performance with that of CE MRI or CT, 
      the current clinical standard, in the detection of residual viable HCC after 
      transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) in a prospective multicenter trial. 
      Materials and Methods Participants aged at least 21 years with US-visible HCC 
      scheduled for TACE were consecutively enrolled at one of three participating 
      academic medical centers from May 2016 to March 2022. Each underwent baseline 2D 
      and 3D CE US before TACE, 2D and 3D CE US 1-2 weeks and/or 4-6 weeks after TACE, 
      and CE MRI or CT 4-6 weeks after TACE. CE US and CE MRI or CT were evaluated by 
      three fellowship-trained radiologists for the presence or absence of viable 
      tumors and were compared with reference standards of pathology (18%), angiography 
      on re-treatment after identification of residual disease at 1-2-month follow-up 
      imaging (31%), 4-8-month CE MRI or CT (42%), or short-term (approximately 1-2 
      months) CE MRI or CT if clinically decompensated and estimated viability was 
      greater than 50% at imaging (9%). Diagnostic performance criteria, including 
      sensitivity and specificity, were obtained for each modality and time point with 
      generalized estimating equation analysis. Results A total of 132 participants 
      were included (mean age, 64 years ± 7 [SD], 87 male). Sensitivity of 2D CE US 4-6 
      weeks after TACE was 91% (95% CI: 84, 95), which was higher than that of CE MRI 
      or CT (68%; 95% CI: 58, 76; P < .001). Sensitivity of 3D CE US 4-6 weeks after 
      TACE was 89% (95% CI: 81, 94), which was higher than that of CE MRI or CT (P < 
      .001), with no evidence of a difference from 2D CE US (P = .22). CE MRI or CT had 
      85% (95% CI: 76, 91) specificity, higher than that of 4-6-week 2D and 3D CE US 
      (70% [95% CI: 56, 80] and 67% [95% CI: 53, 78], respectively; P = .046 and P = 
      .023, respectively). No evidence of differences in any diagnostic criteria were 
      observed between 1-2-week and 4-6-week 2D CE US (P > .21). Conclusion The 2D and 
      3D CE US examinations 4-6 weeks after TACE revealed higher sensitivity in the 
      detection of residual HCC than CE MRI or CT, albeit with lower specificity. 
      Importantly, CE US performance was independent of follow-up time. Clinical trial

TI  - Safety and feasibility of liver resection including major hepatectomy for 
      geriatric patients with hepatocellular carcinoma: a retrospective observational 
      study.

AB  - BACKGROUND: It is unclear whether hepatectomy, which ranges in invasiveness from 
      partial to major hepatectomy, is safe and feasible for older adult patients. 
      Therefore, we compared its postoperative complications and long-term outcomes 
      between younger and older adult patients. METHODS: Patients who underwent 
      hepatectomies for hepatocellular carcinoma (N = 883) were evaluated. Patients 
      were divided into two groups: aged < 75 years (N = 593) and ≥ 75 years (N = 290). 
      Short-term outcomes and prognoses were compared between the groups in the entire 
      cohort. The same analyses were performed for the major hepatectomy cohort. 
      RESULTS: In the entire cohort, no significant differences were found in 
      complications between patients aged < 75 and ≥ 75 years, and the multivariate 
      analysis did not reveal age as a prognostic factor for postoperative 
      complications. However, overall survival was significantly worse in older 
      patients, although no significant differences were noted in time to recurrence or 
      cancer-specific survival. In the multivariate analyses of time to recurrence, 
      overall survival, and cancer-specific survival, although older age was an 
      independent poor prognostic factor for overall survival, it was not a prognostic 
      factor for time to recurrence and cancer-specific survival. In the major 
      hepatectomy subgroup, short- and long-term outcomes, including time to 
      recurrence, overall survival, and cancer-specific survival, did not differ 
      significantly between the age groups. In the multivariate analysis, age was not a 
      significant prognostic factor for complications, time to recurrence, overall 
      survival, or cancer-specific survival. CONCLUSION: Hepatectomy, including minor 
      and major hepatectomy, may be safe and oncologically feasible options for 
      selected older adult patients with hepatocellular carcinoma.

TI  - Survival in Patients With Recurrent Intermediate-Stage Hepatocellular Carcinoma: 
      Sorafenib Plus TACE vs TACE Alone Randomized Clinical Trial.
PG  - 1047-1054
LID - 10.1001/jamaoncol.2024.1831 [doi]
AB  - IMPORTANCE: Transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) is commonly used to treat 
      patients with recurrent intermediate-stage hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and 
      positive microvascular invasion (MVI); however, TACE alone has demonstrated 
      unsatisfactory survival benefits. A previous retrospective study suggested that 
      TACE plus sorafenib (SOR-TACE) may be a better therapeutic option compared with 
      TACE alone. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the clinical outcomes of SOR-TACE vs TACE 
      alone for patients with recurrent intermediate-stage HCC after R0 hepatectomy 
      with positive MVI. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: In this phase 3, 
      open-label, multicenter randomized clinical trial, patients with recurrent 
      intermediate-stage HCC and positive MVI were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio via 
      a computerized minimization technique to either SOR-TACE treatment or TACE alone. 
      This trial was conducted at 5 hospitals in China, and enrolled patients from 
      October 2019 to December 2021, with a follow-up period of 24 months. Data were 
      analyzed from June 2023 to September 2023. INTERVENTIONS: Randomization to 
      on-demand TACE (conventional TACE: doxorubicin, 50 mg, mixed with lipiodol and 
      gelatin sponge particles [diameter: 150-350 μm]; drug-eluting bead TACE: 
      doxorubicin, 75 mg, mixed with drug-eluting particles [diameter: 100-300 μm or 
      300-500 μm]) (TACE group) or sorafenib, 400 mg, twice daily plus on-demand TACE 
      (SOR-TACE group) (conventional TACE: doxorubicin, 50 mg, mixed with lipiodol and 
      gelatin sponge particles [diameter, 150-350 μm]; drug-eluting bead TACE: 
      doxorubicin, 75 mg, mixed with drug-eluting particles [diameter: 100-300 μm or 
      300-500 μm]). MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary end point was overall 
      survival by intention-to-treat analysis. Safety was assessed in patients who 
      received at least 1 dose of study treatment. RESULTS: A total of 162 patients 
      (median [range] age, 55 [28-75] years; 151 males [93.2%]), were randomly assigned 
      to be treated with either SOR-TACE (n = 81) or TACE alone (n = 81). The median 
      overall survival was significantly longer in the SOR-TACE group than in the TACE 
      group (22.2 months vs 15.1 months; hazard ratio [HR], 0.55; P < .001). SOR-TACE 
      also prolonged progression-free survival (16.2 months vs 11.8 months; HR, 0.54; 
      P < .001), and improved the objective response rate when compared with TACE alone 
      based on the modified Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors criteria 
      (80.2% vs 58.0%; P = .002). Any grade adverse events were more common in the 
      SOR-TACE group, but all adverse events responded well to treatment. No unexpected 
      adverse events or treatment-related deaths occurred in this study. CONCLUSIONS 
      AND RELEVANCE: The results of this randomized clinical trial demonstrated that 
      SOR-TACE achieved better clinical outcomes than TACE alone. These findings 
      suggest that combined treatment should be used for patients with recurrent 
      intermediate-stage HCC after R0 hepatectomy with positive MVI. TRIAL

TI  - Nivolumab plus ipilimumab combination therapy in patients with advanced 
      hepatocellular carcinoma previously treated with sorafenib: 5-year results from 
      CheckMate 040.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Nivolumab plus ipilimumab demonstrated promising clinical activity 
      and durable responses in sorafenib-treated patients with advanced hepatocellular 
      carcinoma (HCC) in the CheckMate 040 study at 30.7-month median follow-up. Here, 
      we present 5-year results from this cohort. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients were 
      randomized 1 : 1 : 1 to arm A [nivolumab 1 mg/kg plus ipilimumab 3 mg/kg Q3W 
      (four doses)] or arm B [nivolumab 3 mg/kg plus ipilimumab 1 mg/kg Q3W (four 
      doses)], each followed by nivolumab 240 mg Q2W, or arm C (nivolumab 3 mg/kg Q2W 
      plus ipilimumab 1 mg/kg Q6W). The primary objectives were safety, tolerability, 
      investigator-assessed objective response rate (ORR), and duration of response 
      (DOR) per RECIST version 1.1. RESULTS: A total of 148 patients were randomized 
      across treatment arms. At 60-month minimum follow-up (62.6-month median 
      follow-up), the ORR was 34% (n = 17), 27% (n = 13), and 29% (n = 14) in arms A, 
      B, and C, respectively. The median DOR was 51.2 months [95% confidence interval 
      (CI) 12.6 months-not estimable (NE)], 15.2 months (95% CI 7.1 months-NE), and 
      21.7 months (95% CI 4.2 months-NE), respectively. The median overall survival 
      (OS) was 22.2 months (34/50; 95% CI 9.4-54.8 months) in arm A, 12.5 months 
      (38/49; 95% CI 7.6-16.4 months) in arm B, and 12.7 months (40/49; 95% CI 7.4-30.5 
      months) in arm C; 60-month OS rates were 29%, 19%, and 21%, respectively. In an 
      exploratory analysis of OS by response (6-month landmark), the median OS was 
      meaningfully longer for responders versus nonresponders for all arms. No new 
      safety signals were identified with longer follow-up. There were no new 
      discontinuations due to immune-mediated adverse events since the primary 
      analysis. CONCLUSIONS: Consistent with the primary analysis, the arm A regimen of 
      nivolumab plus ipilimumab continued to demonstrate clinically meaningful 
      responses and long-term survival benefit, with no new safety signals in patients 
      with advanced HCC following sorafenib treatment, further supporting its use as a 
      second-line treatment in these patients.

      treatment of advanced hepatocellular carcinoma with extrahepatic metastasis: a 
      randomized, double-blind comparative study.

AB  - The majority of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cases are diagnosed at an advanced 
      stage. Currently, there are only a few therapeutic methods available for patients 
      with advanced HCC and extrahepatic metastasis (EHM). Systemic chemotherapy, such 
      as FOLFOX4 (infusions of fluorouracil, leucovorin, and oxaliplatin), has been 
      reported for treating advanced HCC with EHM, but its effectiveness is very poor. 
      In this randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study, we aimed to assess 
      the efficacy and safety of FOLFOX4 with all-trans-retinoic acid (ATRA) as a 
      palliative treatment for HCC patients with EHM, compared to FOLFOX4 with a 
      placebo. The primary endpoint was overall survival (OS), and subsequently, an 
      exploratory model was developed based on bioinformatics to predict the efficacy 
      of FOLFOX4-ATRA treatment. A total of 108 patients were randomly assigned in a 
      1:1 ratio to receive either FOLFOX4-ATRA or FOLFOX4-placebo. The 
      intention-to-treat (ITT) population showed a median OS of 16.2 months for the 
      FOLFOX4-ATRA group, compared with 10.7 months for the FOLFOX4-placebo group (HR 
      0.56, 95% CI 0.33-0.93; p = 0.025). The median progression-free survival (PFS) 
      was 7.1 months for the FOLFOX4-ATRA group and 4.2 months for the FOLFOX4-placebo 
      group (HR 0.62, 95% CI 0.41-0.94; p = 0.024). A panel of proteins with unique 
      upregulation during complete response (CR) (SOD3, TTR, SSC5D, GP5, IGKV1D-33) and 
      partial response (PR) (TGFB1, GSS, IGHV5-10-1) effectively predicted CR and PR in 
      patients treated with FOLFOX4-ATRA, as compared to FOLFOX4-placebo. The results 
      suggest that FOLFOX4-ATRA is a safe and effective treatment for patients with 
      advanced HCC and EHM in eastern China.

AB  - Notable-HCC (NCT05185531) is a phase 1b trial, aiming to evaluate the safety and 
      preliminary effectiveness of neoadjuvant PD-1 blockade plus stereotactic body 
      radiotherapy (SBRT) in early-stage resectable hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). 
      Twenty patients with HCC of BCLC stage 0-A received 3  ×  Gy SBRT and two cycles 
      of tislelizumab, an anti-PD-1 monoclonal antibody before the curative HCC 
      resection. Primary endpoints were the surgery delay, radiographic and 
      pathological tumor response after the neoadjuvant therapy, safety and 
      tolerability. During the neoadjuvant therapy, treatment-related adverse events 
      (TRAEs) of grade 1-2 occurred in all 20 patients (100%), eight patients (40%) had 
      grade 3 TRAEs, no grade 4 to 5 TRAE occurred, and all resolved without 
      corticosteroids treatment. Per mRECIST, the objective response rate was 63.2% 
      (12/19), with 3 complete response; the disease control rate was 100%. Two (10.5%) 
      patients achieved complete pathological response. No surgery delay occurred. The 
      neoadjuvant therapy did not increase the surgical difficulty or the incidence of 
      complications. Secondary endpoints of disease-free survival and overall survival 
      were not mature at the time of the analysis. Our pilot trial shows that 
      neoadjuvant therapy with anti-PD-1 + SBRT is safe and promotes tumor responses in 
      early-stage resectable HCC.

AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a highly fatal cancer 
      characterized by high intra-tumor heterogeneity (ITH). A panoramic understanding 
      of its tumor evolution, in relation to its clinical trajectory, may provide novel 
      prognostic and treatment strategies. METHODS: Through the Asia-Pacific 
      Hepatocellular Carcinoma trials group (NCT03267641), we recruited one of the 
      largest prospective cohorts of patients with HCC, with over 600 whole genome and 
      transcriptome samples from 123 treatment-naïve patients. RESULTS: Using a 
      multi-region sampling approach, we revealed seven convergent genetic evolutionary 
      paths governed by the early driver mutations, late copy number variations and 
      viral integrations, which stratify patient clinical trajectories after surgical 
      resection. Furthermore, such evolutionary paths shaped the molecular profiles, 
      leading to distinct transcriptomic subtypes. Most significantly, although we 
      found the coexistence of multiple transcriptomic subtypes within certain tumors, 
      patient prognosis was best predicted by the most aggressive cell fraction of the 
      tumor, rather than by overall degree of transcriptomic ITH level - a phenomenon 
      we termed the 'bad apple' effect. Finally, we found that characteristics 
      throughout early and late tumor evolution provide significant and complementary 
      prognostic power in predicting patient survival. CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, our 
      study generated a comprehensive landscape of evolutionary history for HCC and 
      provides a rich multi-omics resource for understanding tumor heterogeneity and 
      clinical trajectories. IMPACT AND IMPLICATIONS: This prospective study, utilizing 
      comprehensive multi-sector, multi-omics sequencing and clinical data from 
      surgically resected hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), reveals critical insights 
      into the role of tumor evolution and intra-tumor heterogeneity (ITH) in 
      determining the prognosis of HCC. These findings are invaluable for oncology 
      researchers and clinicians, as they underscore the influence of distinct 
      evolutionary paths and the 'bad apple' effect, where the most aggressive tumor 
      fraction dictates disease progression. These insights not only enhance prognostic 
      accuracy post-surgical resection but also pave the way for personalized treatment 
      strategies tailored to specific tumor evolutionary and transcriptomic profiles. 
      The coexistence of multiple subtypes within the same tumor prompts a re-appraisal 
      of the utilities of depending on single samples to represent the entire tumor and 
      suggests the need for clinical molecular imaging. This research thus marks a 
      significant step forward in the clinical understanding and management of HCC, 
      underscoring the importance of integrating tumor evolutionary dynamics and 
      multi-omics biomarkers into therapeutic decision-making. CLINICAL TRIAL NUMBER: 
      NCT03267641 (Observational cohort).

TI  - Diabetes risk reduction diet and risk of liver cancer and chronic liver disease 
      mortality: A prospective cohort study.
PG  - 410-421
LID - 10.1111/joim.20007 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: We aimed to prospectively evaluate the association between a diabetes 
      risk reduction diet (DRRD) score and the risk of liver cancer development and 
      chronic liver disease-specific mortality. METHODS: We included 98,786 
      postmenopausal women from the Women's Health Initiative-Observational Study and 
      the usual diet arm of the Diet Modification trial. The DRRD score was derived 
      from eight factors: high intakes of dietary fiber, coffee, nuts, polyunsaturated 
      fatty acids, low intakes of red and processed meat, foods with high glycemic 
      index, sugar-sweetened beverages (SSBs), and trans fat based on a validated 
      Food-Frequency Questionnaire administered at baseline (1993-1998). Multivariable 
      hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for liver cancer incidence 
      and chronic liver disease mortality were estimated using Cox proportional hazards 
      regression models. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: After a median follow-up of 22.0 
      years, 216 incident liver cancer cases and 153 chronic liver disease deaths were 
      confirmed. A higher DRRD score was significantly associated with a reduced risk 
      of developing liver cancer (HR(Tertile 3 vs. Tertile 1) = 0.69; 95% CI: 
      0.49-0.97; P(trend) = 0.03) and chronic liver disease mortality (HR(T3 vs. 
      T1) = 0.54; 95% CI: 0.35-0.82; P(trend) = 0.003). We further found inverse 
      associations with dietary fiber and coffee, and positive associations with 
      dietary glycemic index, SSBs, and trans fat. A higher DRRD score was associated 
      with reduced risk of developing liver cancer and chronic liver disease mortality 
      among postmenopausal women.

AB  - Advanced intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC) has a dismal prognosis. Here, we 
      report the efficacy and safety of combining toripalimab, lenvatinib, and 
      gemcitabine plus oxaliplatin (GEMOX) as first-line therapy for advanced ICC. 
      Thirty patients with pathologically confirmed advanced ICC received intravenous 
      gemcitabine (1 g/m(2)) on Days 1 and 8 and oxaliplatin (85 mg/m(2)) Q3W for six 
      cycles along with intravenous toripalimab (240 mg) Q3W and oral lenvatinib (8 mg) 
      once daily for one year. The expression of programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) and 
      genetic status was investigated in paraffin-embedded tissues using 
      immunohistochemistry and whole-exome sequencing (WES) analysis. The primary 
      endpoint was the objective response rate (ORR). Secondary outcomes included 
      safety, overall survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS), disease control 
      rate (DCR) and duration of response (DoR). As of July 1, 2022, the median 
      follow-up time was 23.5 months, and the ORR was 80%. Twenty-three patients 
      achieved partial response, and one achieved complete response. Patients (21/30) 
      with DNA damage response (DDR)-related gene mutations showed a higher ORR, while 
      patients (14/30) with tumor area positivity ≥1 (PD-L1 staining) showed a trend of 
      high ORR, but without significant difference. The median OS, PFS, and DoR were 
      22.5, 10.2, and 11.0 months, respectively. The DCR was 93.3%. Further, 56.7% of 
      patients experienced manageable grade ≥3 adverse events (AEs), commonly 
      neutropenia (40.0%) and leukocytopenia (23.3%). In conclusion, toripalimab plus 
      lenvatinib and GEMOX are promising first-line regimens for the treatment of 
      advanced ICC. A phase-III, multicenter, double-blinded, randomized study to 
      validate our findings was approved by the National Medical Products 
      Administration (NMPA, No. 2021LP01825).Trial registration Clinical trials: 
      NCT03951597.

TI  - Impact of Transarterial Chemoembolization or Hepatic Artery Infusion Chemotherapy 
      on Liver Function after Hepatocellular Carcinoma Resection: An Observational 
      Study.
PG  - 291-298
LID - 10.1159/000528750 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Liver surgery leads to a high degree of heterogeneity in the 
      prognosis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients. However, most previous 
      studies focused on the postoperative therapeutic effects of other treatments, 
      with relatively few studies on the impacts on liver function. This study 
      investigated the impact of transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) and hepatic 
      artery infusion chemotherapy (HAIC) on liver function after HCC resection from 
      various angles. METHODS: 138 HCC patients were enrolled, including 27 patients 
      who received TACE and 80 patients who received HAIC. Besides routine treatment 
      such as liver protection and antiviral therapy, 31 patients received no other 
      treatment. The different groups were compared with various biological parameters 
      with four types of scoring methods. RESULTS: In the short term after TACE, the 
      mean (±SD) alanine transaminase and aspartate transaminase values increased by 
      79.22 ± 117.43 U/L and 66.33 ± 94.54 U/L, respectively (p < 0.01). The mean (±SD) 
      total bilirubin (TBIL) values increased by 4.02 ± 6.08 μmol/L (p < 0.01). The 
      mean (±SD) albumin (ALB) values decreased by 3.54 ± 2.93 g/L (p < 0.001). The 
      mean (±SD) albumin bilirubin (ALBI) scores increased by 0.39 ± 0.22 (p < 0.001). 
      In the short term after HAIC, the mean (±SD) TBIL values increased by 2.11 ± 5.57 
      μmol/L (p < 0.01). The mean (±SD) ALB values decreased by 2.52 ± 3.26 g/L (p < 
      0.001), and the mean (±SD) ALBI scores increased by 0.21 ± 0.42 (p < 0.001). In 
      both treatment groups, the long-term liver function was not significantly 
      different from that before treatment and also from that of the untreated group (p 
      > 0.05). CONCLUSION: TACE after HCC resection has a significant impact on 
      short-term liver function, whereas HAIC has a relatively small impact, but 
      neither has a major impact on long-term liver function.

AB  - RATIONALE AND OBJECTIVES: Acute liver function deterioration (ALFD) following 
      drug-eluting beads transarterial chemotherapy embolism (DEB-TACE) was considered 
      a risk factor for prognosis in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). In 
      this study, we aimed to develop and validate a nomogram for the prediction of 
      ALFD after DEB-TACE. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 288 patients with HCC from 
      a single center were randomly divided into a training dataset (n = 201) and a 
      validation dataset (n = 87). The univariate and multivariate logistic regression 
      analyses were performed to determine risk factors for ALFD. The least absolute 
      shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) was applied to identify the key risk 
      factors and fit a model. The performance, calibration, and clinical utility of 
      the predictive nomogram were assessed using receiver operating characteristic 
      curves, calibration curves, and decision curve analysis (DCA). RESULTS: LASSO 
      regression analysis determined six risk factors with fibrosis index based on four 
      factors (FIB-4) as the independent factor for the occurrence of ALFD after 
      DEB-TACE. Gamma-glutamyltransferase, FIB-4, tumor extent, and portal vein 
      invasion were integrated into the nomogram. In both the training and validation 
      cohorts, the nomogram demonstrated promising discrimination with AUC of 0.762 and 
      0.878, respectively. The calibration curves and DCA revealed good calibration and 
      clinical utility of the predictive nomogram. CONCLUSION: The nomogram-based risk 
      of ALFD stratification may improve clinical decision-making and surveillance 
      protocols for patients with a high risk of ALFD after DEB-TACE.

TI  - Organ-specific responses to atezolizumab plus bevacizumab in advanced 
      hepatocellular carcinoma: A multicentre, retrospective study.
PG  - 1961-1970
LID - 10.1111/liv.15935 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Anti-programmed death 1 (PD-1) monotherapy triggers various 
      responses by each organ. In advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), while 
      extrahepatic lesions demonstrate objective response rates (ORR) of 20%-40%, only 
      10% of intrahepatic lesions respond. Although first-line atezolizumab/bevacizumab 
      has shown survival benefits in advanced HCC, organ-specific responses remain 
      unexplored. Therefore, we aimed to assess organ-specific responses in patients 
      with advanced HCC receiving atezolizumab/bevacizumab. METHODS: This 
      retrospective, multicenter, observational study included patients who received 
      first-line atezolizumab/bevacizumab for advanced HCC. Patients with Child-Pugh 
      class A, measurable tumour lesions and serial imaging available for response 
      evaluation were eligible. RESULTS: Between May 2020 and June 2021, 131 patients 
      (median age: 62) from three cancer referral institutions were included. 
      Ninety-one had hepatitis B (69.5%), 108 were at Barcelona clinic liver cancer 
      stage C (82.4%), and 78 had extrahepatic metastasis (59.5%). After a median 
      follow-up of 10.1 months, median progression-free survival was 6.8 months (95% 
      confidence interval [CI], 4.6-9.2), median overall survival remained unreached 
      (95% CI, range unavailable) and the ORR was 29.0%. Among 270 individual tumour 
      lesions, the liver was the most commonly involved organ (n = 158). 
      Atezolizumab/bevacizumab induced ORR of 27.8%, 42.2%, 29.1% and 21.0% for liver, 
      lymph nodes, lungs and other sites, respectively. The organ-specific response 
      rate for intrahepatic tumours decreased with increasing size (35.6%: <5 cm, 
      15.0%: ≥ 5 cm). CONCLUSIONS: Unlike anti-PD-1 monotherapy, 
      atezolizumab/bevacizumab demonstrated favourable responses in intrahepatic 
      lesions, comparable to those in extrahepatic lesions, and may potentially 
      overcome the immune-tolerant hepatic microenvironment in patients with advanced 
      HCC.

TI  - IMbrave152/SKYSCRAPER-14: a Phase III study of atezolizumab, bevacizumab and

PG  - 2049-2057
LID - 10.1080/14796694.2024.2355863 [doi]
AB  - Atezolizumab plus bevacizumab is a standard of care, first-line therapy for 
      advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Myeloid and T regulatory cells are key 
      immunosuppressive cell types within the hepatic tumor microenvironment associated 
      with clinical resistance to atezolizumab and bevacizumab therapy for HCC and 
      overall poor prognosis. Therapeutic targeting of TIGIT, which is highly expressed 
      in these cells, with tiragolumab may overcome the immunosuppressive environment 
      and improve clinical benefit, a hypothesis supported by positive efficacy signals 
      in the Phase Ib/II MORPHEUS-Liver study. This paper describes the rationale and 
      design of IMbrave152/SKYSCRAPER-14, a randomized, double-blind, 
      placebo-controlled Phase III study comparing atezolizumab and bevacizumab with 
      tiragolumab or placebo in patients with HCC and no prior systemic 
      treatment.Clinical Trial Registration: NCT05904886 (ClinicalTrials.gov).

OAB - This research study is designed to test a new treatment combination for liver 
      cancer, specifically for patients whose cancer cannot be removed with surgery or 
      has spread. The treatment involves three medications: atezolizumab, 
      bevacizumab and tiragolumab.Atezolizumab and bevacizumab are already used 
      together as a standard treatment for liver cancer. Tiragolumab is designed to 
      block the TIGIT receptor, which is normally involved in holding back the immune 
      cells that would attack the tumor. Because tiragolumab may restore the immune 
      response against the tumor, adding tiragolumab might make the treatment more 
      effective.The study is being done worldwide and includes patients who have not 
      received any previous systemic treatment for their advanced liver cancer. 
      Patients participating in the study will be randomly placed into two groups. One 
      group will receive the new combination of three medications, while the other 
      group will receive the standard treatment of two medications plus a placebo (a 
      treatment with no active ingredient). The main goal is to see if the new 
      combination helps patients live longer and slows the cancer’s growth compared 
      with the standard treatment. Safety and how patients feel during the treatment 
      are also important parts of the study.

TI  - Skeletal muscle quality predicts overall survival in advanced liver 
      hepatocellular carcinoma treated with SIRT and sorafenib: A subanalysis of the 
      SORAMIC trial.
PG  - 1016-1027
LID - 10.1002/ueg2.12627 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Our purpose was to assess the impact of muscle quality on 
      overall survival (OS) in patients with advanced HCC. METHODS: This is a 
      subanalysis of the SORAMIC trial. Overall, 363 patients were included. The 
      SIRT/Sorafenib treatment group comprised 182 patients and the sorafenib group 181 
      patients. Myosteatosis was defined as skeletal muscle density (SMD) < 41 HU for 
      patients with a body mass index up to 24.9 kg/m(2) and <33 HU for patients with a 
      body mass index ≥25 kg/m(2). Albumin-gauge score was calculated as follows: serum 
      albumin (g/dL) × SMD (HU). To assess the impact of muscle quality on clinical 
      variables and OS, a Cox regression model was used. Hazard ratios are presented 
      together with 95 % confidence intervals (95 % CI). Kaplan-Meier curves were used 
      for survival analysis. RESULTS: In the SIRT/sorafenib cohort, low albumin-gauge 
      score was an independent predictor of worse OS, HR = 1.74, CI 95% (1.16-2.62), 
      p = 0.01. In the sorafenib cohort, muscle quality parameters did not predict OS. 
      In alcohol-induced HCC (n = 129), myosteatosis independently predicted OS, 
      HR = 1.85, CI 95% (1.10; 3.12), p = 0.02. In viral-induced HCC (n = 99), 
      parameters of muscle quality did not predict OS. In patients with 
      NASH/Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) induced HCC, albumin-gauge score 
      was a strong independent predictor of worse OS in the subgroup undergoing 
      combined treatment with SIRT and sorafenib, HR = 9.86, CI 95% (1.12; 86.5), 
      p = 0.04. CONCLUSIONS: Myosteatosis predicts independently worse OS in patients 
      with alcohol-induced HCC undergoing combined treatment with SIRT and sorafenib. 
      In patients with NASH/NAFLD induced HCC undergoing treatment with SIRT and 
      sorafenib, albumin-gauge score predicts independently worse OS. IMPACT AND 
      IMPLICATIONS: Associations between parameters of muscle quality and OS are 
      different in accordance to the treatment strategy and etiology of HCC. These 
      findings highlight the prognostic potential of skeletal muscle quality in 
      patients with advanced HCC.

TI  - Adjuvant Transarterial Chemoembolization With Sorafenib for Portal Vein Tumor 
      Thrombus: A Randomized Clinical Trial.
PG  - 616-624
LID - 10.1001/jamasurg.2024.0506 [doi]
AB  - IMPORTANCE: Certain patients with hepatocellular carcinoma with portal vein tumor 
      thrombus could benefit from surgical resection, and postoperative adjuvant 
      therapy may lower the incidence of tumor recurrence. OBJECTIVE: To compare the 
      efficacy and safety of sorafenib plus transarterial chemoembolization vs 
      sorafenib alone as postoperative adjuvant therapy for patients with 
      hepatocellular carcinoma with portal vein tumor thrombus. DESIGN, SETTING, AND 
      PARTICIPANTS: This was a phase 3, multicenter, randomized clinical trial 
      conducted in 5 hospitals in China. A total of 158 patients were enrolled and 
      randomized from October 2019 to March 2022, with a median follow-up of 28.4 
      months. Portal vein tumor thrombus was graded by the Cheng classification. 
      Eligible patients with hepatocellular carcinoma with Cheng grade I to III portal 
      vein tumor thrombus (ie, involving segmental or sectoral branches, right- or 
      left-side branch, or main trunk of portal vein) were included. INTERVENTIONS: 
      Patients were randomly assigned 1:1 to receive transarterial chemoembolization 
      with sorafenib or sorafenib alone as postoperative adjuvant therapy. Sorafenib 
      treatment was started within 3 days after randomization, with an initial dose of 
      400 mg orally twice a day. In the transarterial chemoembolization with sorafenib 
      group, transarterial chemoembolization was performed 1 day after the first 
      administration of sorafenib. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary end point 
      was recurrence-free survival. Efficacy was assessed in the intention-to-treat 
      population and safety was assessed in patients who received at least 1 dose of 
      study treatment. RESULTS: Of 158 patients included, the median (IQR) age was 54 
      (43-61) years, and 140 (88.6%) patients were male. The median (IQR) 
      recurrence-free survival was significantly longer in the transarterial 
      chemoembolization with sorafenib group (16.8 [12.0-NA] vs 12.6 [7.8-18.1] months; 
      hazard ratio [HR], 0.57; 95% CI, 0.39-0.83; P = .002). The median (IQR) overall 
      survival was also significantly longer with transarterial chemoembolization with 
      sorafenib than with sorafenib alone (30.4 [20.6-NA] vs 22.5 [15.4-NA] months; HR, 
      0.57; 95% CI, 0.36-0.91; P = .02). The most common grade 3/4 adverse event was 
      hand-foot syndrome (23 of 79 patients in the transarterial chemoembolization with 
      sorafenib group [29.1%] vs 24 of 79 patients in the sorafenib alone group 
      [30.4%]). There were no treatment-related deaths in either group. The 
      transarterial chemoembolization with sorafenib group did not show additional 
      toxicity compared with the sorafenib monotherapy group. CONCLUSION AND RELEVANCE: 
      In this study, the combination of sorafenib and transarterial chemoembolization 
      as postoperative adjuvant therapy in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma with 
      portal vein tumor thrombus resulted in longer recurrence-free survival and 
      overall survival than sorafenib alone and was well tolerated. TRIAL REGISTRATION:

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Targeted therapy combined with immunotherapy has become the main 
      treatment option for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). This trial assessed the 
      safety and efficacy of fibroblast growth factor receptor 4 inhibitor (BLU-554) in 
      combination with the anti-PD-L1 monoclonal antibody (CS1001) in patients with 
      locally advanced or metastatic HCC. PATIENTS AND METHODS: This Phase Ib/II trial 
      enrolled patients with locally advanced or metastatic HCC who were 
      FGF19-positive. The patients were intravenously administered with CS1001 
      (1200 mg) every three weeks and orally administered with BLU-554 (600 mg) daily. 
      The primary endpoint was objective response rate (ORR), as assessed according to 
      RECISTv1.1. RESULTS: Four patients were treated with BLU-554 combined with 
      CS1001. The trial revealed a 50% ORR and 100% DCR. The main adverse reactions 
      that were attributed to BLU-554 in combination with CS1001 were diarrhoea, liver 
      function impairments and skin rashes. Only one patient had immune-related adverse 
      reactions. CONCLUSION: Preliminary data showed that BLU-554 in combination with 
      CS1001 is safe and effective for treatment of patients with locally advanced or 
      metastatic HCC.

TI  - Low-contrast-dose liver CT using low monoenergetic images with deep 
      learning-based denoising for assessing hepatocellular carcinoma: a randomized 
      controlled noninferiority trial.
PG  - 4344-4354
LID - 10.1007/s00330-022-09298-x [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Low monoenergetic images obtained using noise-reduction techniques may 
      reduce CT contrast media requirements. We aimed to investigate the effectiveness 
      of low-contrast-dose CT using dual-energy CT and deep learning-based denoising 
      (DLD) techniques in patients at high risk of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). 
      METHODS: We performed a prospective, randomized controlled noninferiority trial 
      at a tertiary hospital between June 2019 and August 2020 (NCT04027556). Patients 
      at high risk of HCC were randomly assigned (1:1) to the standard-contrast-dose 
      group or low-contrast-dose group, which targeted a 40% reduction in contrast 
      medium dose based on lean body weight. HCC conspicuity on arterial phase images 
      was the primary endpoint with a noninferiority margin of 0.2. Images were 
      independently assessed by three radiologists; model-based iterative 
      reconstruction (MBIR) images of the standard-contrast-dose group and low 
      monoenergetic (50-keV) DLD images of the low-contrast-dose group were compared 
      using a generalized estimating equation. RESULTS: Ninety participants (age 59 ± 
      10 years; 68 men) were analyzed. Compared with the standard-contrast-dose group 
      (n = 47), 40% less contrast media was used in the low-contrast-dose group (n = 
      43) (107.0 ± 17.1 mL vs. 64.5 ± 11.3 mL, p < 0.001). In the arterial phase, HCC 
      conspicuity on 50-keV DLD images in the low-contrast-dose group was noninferior 
      to that of MBIR images in the standard-contrast-dose group (2.92 vs. 2.56; 
      difference, 0.36; 95% confidence interval, -0.13 to ∞; p = 0.013). CONCLUSIONS: 
      The contrast dose in liver CT can be reduced by 40% without impairing HCC 
      conspicuity when using 50-keV and DLD techniques. KEY POINTS: • In the arterial 
      phase, hepatocellular carcinoma conspicuity on 50-keV deep learning-based 
      denoising images in the low-contrast-dose group was noninferior to that of 
      model-based iterative reconstruction images in the standard-contrast-dose group. 
      • HCC detection was comparable between 50-keV deep learning-based denoising 
      images in the low-contrast-dose group and model-based iterative reconstruction 
      images in the standard-contrast-dose group.

TI  - Low dose of contrast agent and low radiation liver computed tomography with 
      deep-learning-based contrast boosting model in participants at high-risk for 
      hepatocellular carcinoma: prospective, randomized, double-blind study.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the image quality and lesion conspicuity of a 
      deep-learning-based contrast-boosting (DL-CB) algorithm on double-low-dose (DLD) 
      CT of simultaneous reduction of radiation and contrast doses in participants at 
      high-risk for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). METHODS: Participants were 
      recruited and underwent four-phase dynamic CT (NCT04722120). They were randomly 
      assigned to either standard-dose (SD) or DLD protocol. All CT images were 
      initially reconstructed using iterative reconstruction, and the images of the DLD 
      protocol were further processed using the DL-CB algorithm (DLD-DL). The primary 
      endpoint was the contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR), the secondary endpoint was 
      qualitative image quality (noise, hepatic lesion, and vessel conspicuity), and 
      the tertiary endpoint was lesion detection rate. The t-test or repeated measures 
      analysis of variance was used for analysis. RESULTS: Sixty-eight participants 
      with 57 focal liver lesions were enrolled (20 with HCC and 37 with benign 
      findings). The DLD protocol had a 19.8% lower radiation dose (DLP, 
      855.1 ± 254.8 mGy·cm vs. 713.3 ± 94.6 mGy·cm, p = .003) and 27% lower contrast 
      dose (106.9 ± 15.0 mL vs. 77.9 ± 9.4 mL, p < .001) than the SD protocol. The 
      comparative analysis demonstrated that CNR (p < .001) and portal vein conspicuity 
      (p = .002) were significantly higher in the DLD-DL than in the SD protocol. There 
      was no significant difference in lesion detection rate for all lesions (82.7% vs. 
      73.3%, p = .140) and HCCs (75.7% vs. 70.4%, p = .644) between the SD protocol and 
      DLD-DL. CONCLUSIONS: DL-CB on double-low-dose CT provided improved CNR of the 
      aorta and portal vein without significant impairment of the detection rate of HCC 
      compared to the standard-dose acquisition, even in participants at high risk for 
      HCC. KEY POINTS: • Deep-learning-based contrast-boosting algorithm on 
      double-low-dose CT provided an improved contrast-to-noise ratio compared to 
      standard-dose CT. • The detection rate of focal liver lesions was not 
      significantly differed between standard-dose CT and a deep-learning-based 
      contrast-boosting algorithm on double-low-dose CT. • Double-low-dose CT without a 
      deep-learning algorithm presented lower CNR and worse image quality.

TI  - Transcatheter arterial chemoembolization using CalliSpheres beads loaded with 
      arsenic trioxide for unresectable large or huge hepatocellular carcinoma: a 
      prospective study.
PG  - 1258-1267
LID - 10.1007/s00330-023-10097-1 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To determine the safety and efficacy of transcatheter arterial 
      chemoembolization with CalliSpheres® beads loaded with arsenic trioxide 
      (CBATO-TACE) in the first-line treatment of patients with large (5 cm ≤ maximum 
      diameter < 10 cm) or huge (maximum diameter ≥ 10 cm) hepatocellular carcinoma 
      (HCC). METHODS: Patients were randomly allocated to the CBATO-TACE group and the 
      conventional transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (cTACE) group. The primary 
      endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS). The secondary endpoint was overall 
      survival (OS), treatment response, and treatment-related adverse events (TRAEs). 
      The extrahepatic collateral arteries, liver function, and liver fibrosis after 
      the first TACE were also evaluated. RESULTS: From September 2018 to September 
      2020, a total of 207 patients who underwent TACE were consecutively enrolled in 
      this study. The median PFS was 9.5 months (range: 8.0 - 11.0) in the CBATO group, 
      which was significantly longer than that in the cTACE group (6.0 months, range: 
      4.0-6.0) (p < 0.0001). Patients in the CBATO group had a median OS of 22 months 
      (range: 20.0 - 27.0) compared with 16 months (range: 15.0 - 20.0) in the cTACE 
      group (p = 0.0084). The most common TRAEs were fever (p = 0.043), and nausea and 
      vomiting (p = 0.002), which were more observed in the cTACE group. In addition, 
      the progressive disease time, pulmonary metastasis rate (p = 0.01), the mean 
      number of extrahepatic collateral arteries (p = 0.01), and average number of TACE 
      sessions (p = 0.025) were significantly decreased in the CBATO group. 
      CONCLUSIONS: CBATO-TACE achieved better therapeutic outcomes and similar safety 
      profile compared to cTACE in large or huge HCC patients. Furthermore, CBATO-TACE 
      was able to reduce extrahepatic collateral arteries production and extrahepatic 
      lung metastasis. CLINICAL RELEVANCE STATEMENT: Our study showed that 
      CalliSpheres® beads loaded with arsenic trioxide (CBATO-TACE) were effective and 
      safe for the treatment of large and giant HCC. In addition, CBATO-TACE can reduce 
      lateral hepatic branch artery formation and extrahepatic pulmonary metastasis, 
      which provides a new treatment approach for unresectable HCC. KEY POINTS: • We 
      compare long-term efficacy and safety of transcatheter arterial chemoembolization 
      with CalliSpheres® beads loaded with arsenic trioxide (CBATO-TACE) and 
      conventional transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (cTACE) in patients with 
      large (5 cm ≤ maximum diameter < 10 cm) or huge HCC (maximum diameter ≥ 10 cm). • 
      Compared with cTACE, CBATO-TACE significantly improved therapeutic outcomes, 
      overall survival, and progression-free survival in patients with large or huge 
      HCC. The safety assessment suggested that CBATO-TACE is a safe treatment that 
      improves the quality of life and has good treatment adherence.

AB  - PURPOSE: To determine overall survival (OS), best response, and toxicities in 
      patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) previously treated with 
      chemoembolization (TACE+) or yttrium-90 resin transarterial radioembolization 
      (TARE) compared with those of TACE-naïve (T-N) participants. MATERIALS AND 
      METHODS: In this prospective, observational study, 262 adult participants with 
      HCC were divided into TACE+ (n = 93, 35%) or T-N (n = 169, 65%) groups, included 
      from 36 centers in the United States. Overall survival (OS) was assessed using 
      Kaplan-Meier analysis from the date of TARE. Best response at 6 months was 
      evaluated using modified Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors. Six-month 
      toxicities were reported using Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, 
      version 5. RESULTS: Median OS for patients in the TACE+ and T-N groups was 22.3 
      months (95% CI: 17.2 to not reachable) and 21.5 months (95% confidence interval 
      [CI]: 14.9-29.9), respectively (P = .6). Imaging at 6 months ± 2 weeks was 
      available in 156 of 262 (60%) participants. Partial or complete response was seen 
      in 27 of 55 patients (49%) in the TACE+ group and 65 of 101 patients (64%) in the 
      T-N group (P = .2). Six-month toxicities were available in 69 of 93 patients 
      (74%) in the TACE+ group and 135 of 167 patients (81%) in the T-N group. 
      Attributable Grade 3 or greater liver function toxicities were similar between 
      the study groups (all P > .05). CONCLUSIONS: OS and imaging response at 6 months 
      in the TACE+ group was similar to that in the T-N group with similar toxicities. 
      Radioembolization is an acceptable treatment option for patients with HCC 
      previously treated with TACE.

TI  - Anti-hepatitis C antibody carriage and risk of liver impairment in 
      rural-Cameroon: adapting the control of hepatocellular carcinoma for 
      resource-limited settings.
PG  - 875

AB  - BACKGROUND: The Viral hepatitis elimination by 2030 is uncertain in 
      resource-limited settings (RLS), due to high burdens and poor diagnostic 
      coverage. This sounds more challenging for hepatitis C virus (HCV) given that 
      antibody (HCVAb) sero-positivity still lacks wide access to HCV RNA molecular 
      testing. This warrants context-specific strategies for appropriate management of 
      liver impairment in RLS. We herein determine the association between anti-HCV 
      positivity and liver impairment in an African RLS. METHODS: A facility-based 
      observational study was conducted from July-August 2021 among individuals 
      attending the "St Monique" Health Center at Ottou, a rural community of 
      Yaounde,Cameroon. Following a consecutive sampling, consenting individuals were 
      tested for anti-HCV antibodies, hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) and HIV 
      antibodies (HIVAb) as per the national guidelines. After excluding positive cases 
      for HBsAg and/or HIVAb, liver function tests (ALT/AST) were performed on eligible 
      participants (HBsAg and HIVAb negative) and outcomes were compared according to 
      HCVAb status; with p < 0.05 considered statistically significant. RESULTS: Out of 
      306 eligible participants (negative for HBsAg and HIVAb) enrolled, the mean age 
      was 34.35 ± 3.67 years. 252(82.35%) were female and 129 (42.17%) were single. The 
      overall HCVAb sero-positivity was 15.68%(48/306), with 17.86% (45/252) among 
      women vs. 5.55%(3/54) among men [OR (95%CI) = 3.69(2.11-9.29),p = 0.04]. HCVAb 
      Carriage was greater among participants aged > 50 years compared to younger ones 
      [38.46%(15/39) versus 12.36% (33/267) respectively, OR(95%CI) = 4.43(2.11-9.29), 
      p < 0.000] and in multipartnership [26.67%(12/45)vs.13.79%(36/261) 
      monopartnership, OR (95%CI) = 2.27(1.07-4.80),p = 0.03]. The liver impairment 
      rate (abnormal ALT+AST levels) was 30.39%(93/306), with 40.19%(123/306) of 
      abnormal ALT alone. Moreover, the burden of Liver impairment was significantly 
      with aged> 50 versus younger ones [69.23% (27/39) versus 24.72%(66/267) 
      respectively, p < 0.000). Interestingly, the burden of liver impairment (abnormal 
      AST + ALAT) was significantly higher in HCVAb positive (62.5%, 30/48) versus 
      HCVAb negative (24.42%, 63/258) participants, OR: 3.90 [1.96; 7.79], p = 0.0001. 
      CONCLUSIONS: In this rural health facility, HCVAb is highly endemic and the 
      burden of liver impairment is concerning. Interestingly, HCVAb carriage is 
      associated with abnormal liver levels of enzyme (ALT/AST), especially among the 
      elderly populations. Hence, in the absence of nuclei acid testing, ALT/AST are 
      relevant sentinel markers to screen HCVAb carriers who require monitoring/care 
      for HCV-associated hepatocellular carcinoma in RLS.

TI  - Sintilimab plus bevacizumab combined with radiotherapy as first-line treatment 
      for hepatocellular carcinoma with portal vein tumor thrombus: A multicenter, 
      single-arm, phase 2 study.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Systemic treatments are listed as first-line therapies for 
      HCC with portal vein tumor thrombus (PVTT), resulting in modest efficacy. We 
      aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of sintilimab plus bevacizumab combined 
      with radiotherapy in HCC with PVTT and to identify prognostic biomarkers. 
      APPROACH AND RESULTS: This open-label, multicenter, single-arm, phase 2 clinical 
      trial was conducted at 3 tertiary hospitals in China. A total of 46 patients with 
      HCC with PVTT were enrolled. All the patients received the first cycle of i.v. 
      sintilimab (200 mg, day 1) plus bevacizumab (15 mg/kg, day 1) within 3 days after 
      enrollment. Radiotherapy (30-50 Gy/10 fractions) was administered after 2 cycles 
      of Sin-Bev. Sin-Bev was disrupted during radiotherapy and resumed 2 weeks after 
      radiotherapy and continued every 3 weeks thereafter until disease progression, 
      unacceptable toxicity, or withdrawal of consent. The primary end point was 
      objective response rate. Patients obtained an objective response rate of 58.7% 
      and a disease control rate of 100%. After a median follow-up time of 26.0 months 
      (95% CI: 24.0-26.0), the median OS was 24.0 months (95% CI: 19.0 to not 
      applicable) and the median progression-free survival was 13.8 months (95% CI: 
      12.0-21.0), respectively. No unexpected adverse events or treatment-related 
      deaths occurred. Mutations of PCTMD1 were predictive of shorter OS and 
      progression-free survival. CONCLUSIONS: Sintilimab plus bevacizumab combined with 
      radiotherapy provides favorable treatment response and survival outcomes along 
      with an acceptable safety profile in the first-line setting for patients with HCC 
      with PVTT (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT05010434).

TI  - The phosphatidylserine targeting antibody bavituximab plus pembrolizumab in 
      unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma: a phase 2 trial.

AB  - Immune checkpoint inhibitors targeting PD-1/L1 have modest efficacy in 
      hepatocellular carcinoma as single agents. Targeting membranous 
      phosphatidylserine may induce pro-inflammatory and -immune stimulating effects 
      that enhance immunotherapy activity. This hypothesis was tested in a single-arm 
      phase 2 trial evaluating frontline bavituximab, a phosphatidylserine targeting 
      antibody, plus pembrolizumab (anti-PD-1) in patients with unresectable 
      hepatocellular carcinoma (NCT03519997). The primary endpoint was 
      investigator-assessed objective response rate among evaluable patients, and 
      secondary end points included progression-free survival, incidence of adverse 
      events, overall survival, and duration of response. Among 28 evaluable patients, 
      the confirmed response rate was 32.1%, which met the pre-specified endpoint, and 
      the median progression-free survival was 6.3 months (95% CI, 1.3-11.3 months). 
      Treatment related-adverse events of any grade occurred in 45.7% of patients, with 
      grade 3 or greater adverse events in 14.3% of patients. Adverse events of any 
      cause were observed in 33 patients (94.3%), with grade 3 or greater adverse 
      events in 11 patients (31.4%). Prespecified exploratory analyses of baseline 
      tumor specimens showed that a depletion of B cells, and the presence of fibrotic 
      tissue and expression of immune checkpoints in stroma was associated with tumor 
      response. These results suggest that targeting phosphatidylserine may lead to 
      synergistic effects with PD-1 blockade without increasing toxicity rates, and 
      future studies on this therapeutic strategy may be guided by biomarkers 
      characterizing the pre-treatment tumor microenvironment.

AB  - A substantial proportion of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma have to face 
      up, sooner or later, to systemic therapy. The current standards as first line 
      systemic therapies are either atezolizumab (anti-PD-L1) plus bevacizumab 
      (anti-VEGF), or durvalumab (anti-PD-L1) plus tremelimumab (anti-CTLA-4). However, 
      the median overall survival remains below 20 months, and a minority of patients 
      become long-term survivors. Of interest in immune-oncology strategies for 
      hepatocellular carcinoma, the objective response seems to be the most reliable 
      surrogate marker of better overall survival. TRIPLET-HCC (NCT05665348) is a 
      multicentre, randomised, open-label phase II-III trial designed to evaluate 
      efficacy and safety of the triple combination by the addition of ipilimumab 
      (anti-CTLA-4) to atezolizumab/bevacizumab, versus the double 
      atezolizumab/bevacizumab combination. The main inclusion criteria are 
      histologically proven BCLC-B/C HCC without previous systemic therapy. The primary 
      objective of the phase II is the objective response rate in the triple arm, and 
      OS in the triple versus double arms in the phase III. Secondary endpoints common 
      to the phases II and III are the comparisons of progression-free survival, 
      objective response rates, tolerance and quality of life. In addition, genetic and 
      epigenetic studies from tissue and circulating DNA/RNA will be conducted to 
      assess their prognostic or predictive value.

TI  - Serum MYCN as a predictive biomarker of prognosis and therapeutic response in the 
      prevention of hepatocellular carcinoma recurrence.
PG  - 582-594
LID - 10.1002/ijc.34893 [doi]
AB  - The proto-oncogene MYCN expression marked a cancer stem-like cell population in 
      hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and served as a therapeutic target of acyclic 
      retinoid (ACR), an orally administered vitamin A derivative that has demonstrated 
      promising efficacy and safety in reducing HCC recurrence. This study investigated 
      the role of MYCN as a predictive biomarker for therapeutic response to ACR and 
      prognosis of HCC. MYCN gene expression in HCC was analyzed in the Cancer Genome 
      Atlas and a Taiwanese cohort (N = 118). Serum MYCN protein levels were assessed 
      in healthy controls (N = 15), patients with HCC (N = 116), pre- and post-surgical 
      patients with HCC (N = 20), and a subset of patients from a phase 3 clinical 
      trial of ACR (N = 68, NCT01640808). The results showed increased MYCN gene 
      expression in HCC tumors, which positively correlated with HCC recurrence in 
      non-cirrhotic or single-tumor patients. Serum MYCN protein levels were higher in 
      patients with HCC, decreased after surgical resection of HCC, and were associated 
      with liver functional reserve and fibrosis markers, as well as long-term HCC 
      prognosis (>4 years). Subgroup analysis of a phase 3 clinical trial of ACR 
      identified serum MYCN as the risk factor most strongly associated with HCC 
      recurrence. Patients with HCC with higher serum MYCN levels after a 4-week 
      treatment of ACR exhibited a significantly higher risk of recurrence (hazard 
      ratio 3.27; p = .022). In conclusion, serum MYCN holds promise for 
      biomarker-based precision medicine for the prevention of HCC, long-term prognosis 
      of early-stage HCC, and identification of high-response subgroups for ACR-based 
      treatment.

TI  - Hepatocellular carcinoma surveillance may be associated with potential 
      psychological harms in patients with cirrhosis.
PG  - 107-117
LID - 10.1097/HEP.0000000000000528 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: The value of HCC surveillance is determined by the balance 
      between benefits and harms; however, no studies have enumerated psychological 
      harms. APPROACH AND RESULTS: We fielded surveys measuring psychological harms to 
      patients with cirrhosis in a multicenter randomized trial of HCC surveillance 
      outreach. All patients with positive or indeterminate surveillance results and 
      matched patients with negative results were invited to complete surveys measuring 
      (1) depression through the Patient Health Questionnaire-ninth version, (2) 
      anxiety through State-Trait Anxiety Inventory, (3) HCC-specific worry through 
      Psychological Consequences Questionnaire, and (4) decisional regret. Patients 
      were classified into 4 groups: true positive (TP), false positive (FP), 
      indeterminate, and true negative (TN). Multivariable longitudinal regression 
      analysis using the generalized estimating equation method was performed to 
      compare the means of measures across groups. We conducted 89 semistructured 
      interviews in a subset of patients stratified by health system and test results. 
      Of 2872 patients in the trial, 311 completed 1+ follow-up survey (63 FP, 77 
      indeterminate, 38 TP, and 133 TN). Moderate depression decreased in TN patients, 
      increased in TP, and had intermittent but mild increases in those with FP and 
      indeterminate results. High anxiety temporarily increased in patients with TP 
      results but resolved over time and was stable in those with FP and indeterminate 
      results. Decisional regret was low and did not differ across groups. In 
      semistructured interviews, patients reported apprehension, anxiety, emotional 
      distress, and coping related to HCC surveillance. CONCLUSIONS: Psychological 
      harms of HCC surveillance appear mild but differ by test result. Future research 
      should determine the impact of psychological harms on the value of HCC 
      surveillance programs.

TI  - Portable hypothermic oxygenated machine perfusion for organ preservation in liver 
      transplantation: A randomized, open-label, clinical trial.
PG  - 1033-1047
LID - 10.1097/HEP.0000000000000715 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: In liver transplantation, cold preservation induces 
      ischemia, resulting in significant reperfusion injury. Hypothermic oxygenated 
      machine perfusion (HMP-O 2 ) has shown benefits compared to static cold storage 
      (SCS) by limiting ischemia-reperfusion injury. This study reports outcomes using 
      a novel portable HMP-O 2 device in the first US randomized control trial. 
      APPROACH AND RESULTS: The PILOT trial (NCT03484455) was a multicenter, 
      randomized, open-label, noninferiority trial, with participants randomized to 
      HMP-O 2 or SCS. HMP-O 2 livers were preserved using the Lifeport Liver 
      Transporter and Vasosol perfusion solution. The primary outcome was early 
      allograft dysfunction. Noninferiority margin was 7.5%. From April 3, 2019, to 
      July 12, 2022, 179 patients were randomized to HMP-O 2 (n=90) or SCS (n=89). The 
      per-protocol cohort included 63 HMP-O 2 and 73 SCS. Early allograft dysfunction 
      occurred in 11.1% HMP-O 2 (N=7) and 16.4% SCS (N=12). The risk difference between 
      HMP-O 2 and SCS was -5.33% (one-sided 95% upper confidence limit of 5.81%), 
      establishing noninferiority. The risk of graft failure as predicted by Liver 
      Graft Assessment Following Transplant score at seven days (L-GrAFT 7 ) was lower 
      with HMP-O 2 [median (IQR) 3.4% (2.4-6.5) vs. 4.5% (2.9-9.4), p =0.024]. Primary 
      nonfunction occurred in 2.2% of all SCS (n=3, p =0.10). Biliary strictures 
      occurred in 16.4% SCS (n=12) and 6.3% (n=4) HMP-O 2 ( p =0.18). Nonanastomotic 
      biliary strictures occurred only in SCS (n=4). CONCLUSIONS: HMP-O 2 demonstrates 
      safety and noninferior efficacy for liver graft preservation in comparison to 
      SCS. Early allograft failure by L-GrAFT 7 was lower in HMP-O 2 , suggesting 
      improved early clinical function. Recipients of HMP-O 2 livers also demonstrated 
      a lower incidence of primary nonfunction and biliary strictures, although this 
      difference did not reach significance.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The overall value of hepatocellular carcinoma screening is defined by 
      the balance of benefits and harms. Studies have only reported physical harms with 
      none describing financial harms. METHODS: We conducted a multicenter pragmatic 
      randomized clinical trial of hepatocellular carcinoma screening outreach among 
      2872 patients with cirrhosis from March 2018 to April 2021. Patients with 
      positive or indeterminate results and matched patients with negative results 
      completed surveys at baseline and at follow-up measuring financial harms via 
      Cancer Self-Administered Questionnaire and financial burden via Comprehensive 
      Score for Financial Toxicity Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy. 
      Univariable and multivariable longitudinal regression analyses were performed to 
      compare changes in financial harms across groups: true positive, true negative, 
      false positive, and indeterminate. Semistructured interviews were conducted in a 
      subset of patients, sampled by center and test result. RESULTS: Of 311 patients 
      who completed at least 1 follow-up survey (75% response rate), 37 had true 
      positive, 133 true negative, 64 false positive, and 77 indeterminate results. 
      Financial harms increased in true positive and false positive patients with no 
      significant changes noted among those with true negative or indeterminate 
      results. At follow-up, 21.8% of patients reported moderate-severe financial 
      burden, which was not significantly associated with test results. Semistructured 
      interviews revealed variation in the frequency and severity of financial harms 
      based on test results, with increased harm in those with false positive results. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Financial harms of hepatocellular carcinoma screening vary by test 
      result and can pose a barrier that must be considered when determining the 
      optimal screening program.

AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: Stereotactic ablative radiotherapy (SABR) can extend survival 
      and offers the potential for cure in some patients with oligometastatic disease 
      (OMD). However, limited evidence exists regarding its use in oligometastatic 
      hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). We aimed to prospectively investigate the 
      efficacy and safety of SABR in patients with oligometastatic HCC. METHODS: We 
      enrolled patients with controlled primary HCC and one to five metastatic lesions 
      amenable to SABR. The primary endpoint was treatment efficacy defined as overall 
      survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS). The secondary endpoints 
      included time to local progression, objective response rate, disease control 
      rate, toxicities, and quality of life (QOL), assessed using the EORTC QLQ-C30 
      before, and 0, 1, and 3 months after SABR. RESULTS: Overall, 40 consecutive 
      patients received SABR on 62 lesions between 2021 and 2022. The most common 
      locations for OMD were the lungs (48.4%), lymph nodes (22.6%), and bone (17.7%). 
      After a median follow-up of 15.5 months, the 2-year OS was 80%. Median PFS was 
      5.3 months, with 1- and 2-year PFS rates of 21.2% and 0%, respectively. A shorter 
      time to OMD from the controlled primary independently correlated with PFS (p = 
      0.039, hazard ratio 2.127) alongside age, Child-Pugh class, and alpha-fetoprotein 
      (p = 0.002, 0.004, 0.019, respectively). The 2-year time to local progression, 
      objective response rate, and disease control rate were 91.1%, 75.8%, and 98.4%, 
      respectively. Overall, 10% of patients experienced acute toxicity, and 7.5% 
      experienced late toxicity, with no grade 3+ toxicity. All QOL scores remained 
      stable, whereas the patients without systemic treatments had improved insomnia 
      and social functioning scores. CONCLUSIONS: SABR is an effective and feasible 
      option for oligometastatic HCC that leads to excellent local tumor control and 
      improves survival without adversely affecting QOL. IMPACT AND IMPLICATIONS: 
      Stereotactic ablative radiotherapy (SABR) is a non-invasive treatment approach 
      capable of efficiently ablating the target lesion; however, neither the 
      oligometastatic disease concept nor the potential benefits of SABR have been 
      well-defined in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). According to this study, SABR is 
      an effective and safe treatment option for oligometastatic HCC, yielding 
      excellent local tumor control and survival improvement without worsening 
      patients' quality of life, regardless of tumor sites. We also demonstrated that 
      patients with a later presentation of OMD from the controlled primary and lower 
      alpha-fetoprotein levels achieved better survival outcomes. This is the first 
      prospective study of SABR in oligometastatic HCC, providing insights for the 
      development of novel strategies to improve oncologic outcomes. CLINICAL TRIAL

TI  - Messenger RNA electroporated hepatitis B virus (HBV) antigen-specific T cell 
      receptor (TCR) redirected T cell therapy is well-tolerated in patients with 
      recurrent HBV-related hepatocellular carcinoma post-liver transplantation: 
      results from a phase I trial.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Liver transplantation (LT) is the primary curative option 
      for cirrhotic patients with early-stage hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). However, 
      tumor recurrence occurs in 15-20% of cases with unfavorable prognosis. We have 
      developed a library of T cell receptors (TCRs) specific for different hepatitis B 
      virus (HBV) antigens, restricted by different molecules of human leucocyte 
      antigen (HLA)-class I, to redirect T cells against HBV antigens (Banu in Sci Rep 
      4:4166, 2014). We further demonstrated that these transiently functional T cells 
      specific for HBV obtained through messenger RNA (mRNA) electroporation can 
      eliminate HCC cells expressing HBV antigens in vitro and in vivo (Kah in J Clin 
      Invest 127:3177-3188, 2017). A phase I clinical trial for patients with HCC 
      recurrence post-liver transplant was conducted to assess the safety, 
      tolerability, and anti-tumor efficacy of transiently functional HBV-TCR T cells. 
      Here, we report the clinical findings with regard to the safety and anti-tumor 
      efficacy of mRNA electroporated HBV-specific TCR-T cells. (ClinicalTrials.gov 
      identifier: NCT02719782). PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of six patients with 
      HBV-positive recurrent HCC post-liver transplant and HLA-matched to TCR targeting 
      hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) or hepatitis B core antigen (HBcAg) 
      (HLA-A*02:01/HBsAg, HLA-A*11:01/HBcAg, HLA-B*58:01/HBsAg or HLA-C*08:01/HBsAg) 
      were enrolled in this study. The primary objective was to assess the safety of 
      short-lived mRNA electroporated HBV-TCR T cells based on the incidence and 
      severity of the adverse event (AE) graded per National Cancer Institute Common 
      Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI CTCAE), Version 4.0. The secondary 
      objective was to determine the effectiveness of HBV-TCR T cells as per RECIST 1.1 
      criteria. Patients were followed up for survival for 2 years post-end of 
      treatment. RESULTS: The median age of the six patients was 35.5 years (range: 
      28-47). The median number of HBV-TCR T cell infusions administered was 6.5 
      (range: 4-12). The treatment-related AE included grade 1 pyrexia. This study 
      reported no cytokine release syndrome nor neurotoxicity. One patient remained 
      alive and five were deceased at the time of the data cutoff (30 April 2020). 
      CONCLUSION: This study has demonstrated that multiple infusions of mRNA 
      electroporated HBV-specific TCR T cells were well-tolerated in patients with 
      HBV-positive recurrent HCC post-liver transplant.

TI  - Does autoimmune disease impair the survival of hepatocellular carcinoma patients 
      undergoing liver resection? A multi-institutional observational study.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Patients with autoimmune diseases (AD) generally carry an increased 
      risk of developing cancer. However, the effect of AD in hepatocellular carcinoma 
      (HCC) patients receiving surgical treatment is uncertain. The present study aimed 
      to investigate the potential influence of AD on the survival of HCC patients 
      undergoing hepatectomies. METHODS: Operated HCC patients were identified from the 
      Chang Gung Research Database, and the survival outcomes of HCC patients with or 
      without AD were analyzed ad compared. Cox regression model was performed to 
      identify significant risk factors associated with disease recurrence and 
      mortality. RESULTS: From 2002 to 2018, a total of 5532 patients underwent 
      hepatectomy for their HCC. Among them, 229 patients were identified to have AD 
      and 5303 were not. After excluding cases who died within 30 days of surgery, the 
      estimated median overall survival (OS) was 43.8 months in the AD (+) group and 
      47.4 months in the AD (-) group (P = 0.367). The median liver-specific survival 
      and disease-free survival (DFS) were also comparable between the two groups. 
      After Cox regression multivariate analysis, the presence of AD did not lead to a 
      higher risk of all-cause mortality, liver-specific mortality, or disease 
      recurrence. CONCLUSION: Our study demonstrated that autoimmune disease does not 
      impair the OS and DFS of HCC patients undergoing liver resections. AD itself is 
      not a risk factor for tumor recurrence after surgery. Patients eligible for liver 
      resections, as a result, should be considered for surgery irrespective of the 
      presence of AD. Further studies are mandatory to validate our findings.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The mitochondrial pyruvate carrier (MPC) has emerged as a therapeutic 
      target for treating insulin resistance, type 2 diabetes, and nonalcoholic 
      steatohepatitis (NASH). We evaluated whether MPC inhibitors (MPCi) might correct 
      impairments in branched chain amino acid (BCAA) catabolism, which are predictive 
      of developing diabetes and NASH. METHODS: Circulating BCAA concentrations were 
      measured in people with NASH and type 2 diabetes, who participated in a recent 
      randomized, placebo-controlled Phase IIB clinical trial to test the efficacy and 
      safety of the MPCi MSDC-0602K (EMMINENCE; NCT02784444). In this 52-week trial, 
      patients were randomly assigned to placebo (n = 94) or 250 mg MSDC-0602K 
      (n = 101). Human hepatoma cell lines and mouse primary hepatocytes were used to 
      test the direct effects of various MPCi on BCAA catabolism in vitro. Lastly, we 
      investigated how hepatocyte-specific deletion of MPC2 affects BCAA metabolism in 
      the liver of obese mice and MSDC-0602K treatment of Zucker diabetic fatty (ZDF) 
      rats. RESULTS: In patients with NASH, MSDC-0602K treatment, which led to marked 
      improvements in insulin sensitivity and diabetes, had decreased plasma 
      concentrations of BCAAs compared to baseline while placebo had no effect. The 
      rate-limiting enzyme in BCAA catabolism is the mitochondrial branched chain 
      ketoacid dehydrogenase (BCKDH), which is deactivated by phosphorylation. In 
      multiple human hepatoma cell lines, MPCi markedly reduced BCKDH phosphorylation 
      and stimulated branched chain keto acid catabolism; an effect that required the 
      BCKDH phosphatase PPM1K. Mechanistically, the effects of MPCi were linked to 
      activation of the energy sensing AMP-dependent protein kinase (AMPK) and 
      mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) kinase signaling cascades in vitro. BCKDH 
      phosphorylation was reduced in liver of obese, hepatocyte-specific MPC2 knockout 
      (LS-Mpc2-/-) mice compared to wild-type controls concomitant with activation of 
      mTOR signaling in vivo. Finally, while MSDC-0602K treatment improved glucose 
      homeostasis and increased the concentrations of some BCAA metabolites in ZDF 
      rats, it did not lower plasma BCAA concentrations. CONCLUSIONS: These data 
      demonstrate novel cross talk between mitochondrial pyruvate and BCAA metabolism 
      and suggest that MPC inhibition leads to lower plasma BCAA concentrations and 
      BCKDH phosphorylation by activating the mTOR axis. However, the effects of MPCi 
      on glucose homeostasis may be separable from its effects on BCAA concentrations.

TI  - Lenvatinib, sintilimab plus transarterial chemoembolization for advanced stage 
      hepatocellular carcinoma: A phase II study.
PG  - 920-930
LID - 10.1111/liv.15831 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: Our retrospective study has suggested encouraging outcomes of 
      lenvatinib combined with PD-1 inhibitor and transarterial chemoembolization 
      (TACE) on advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). This phase II trial was 
      conducted to prospectively investigate the efficacy and safety of lenvatinib, 
      sintilimab (a PD-1 inhibitor) plus TACE (Len-Sin-TACE) in patients with advanced 
      stage HCC. METHODS: This was a single-arm phase II trial. Patients with BCLC 
      stage C HCC were recruited. They received lenvatinib (bodyweight ≥60 kg, 12 mg; 
      bodyweight <60 kg, 8 mg) orally once daily, sintilimab (200 mg) intravenously 
      once every 3 weeks, and on demand TACE. The primary endpoint was progression-free 
      survival (PFS) per mRECIST. RESULTS: Thirty patients were enrolled. The primary 
      endpoint was met with a median PFS of 8.0 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 6.1-9.8) 
      months per mRECIST, which was the same as that per RECIST 1.1. The objective 
      response rate was 60.0% per mRECIST and 30.0% per RECIST 1.1. The disease control 
      rate was 86.7% per mRECIST/RECIST 1.1. The median duration of response was 7.4 
      (95% CI: 6.6-8.2) months per mRECIST (n = 18) and 4.3 (95% CI: 4.0-4.6) months 
      per RECIST 1.1 (n = 9). The median overall survival was 18.4 (95% CI: 14.5-22.3) 
      months. Treatment-related adverse events (TRAEs) occurred in 28 patients (93.3%) 
      and grade 3 TRAEs were observed in 12 patients (40.0%). There were no grade 4/5 
      TRAEs. CONCLUSIONS: Len-Sin-TACE showed promising antitumour activities with a 
      manageable safety profile in patients with advanced stage HCC. The preliminary 
      results need to be further evaluated with phase III randomized trials.

TI  - Role of palliative SBRT in barcelona clinic liver cancer-stage C hepatocellular 
      carcinoma patients.
PG  - 838-846
LID - 10.1007/s00066-023-02065-x [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the role of palliative stereotactic body radiation therapy 
      (SBRT) in Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer stage‑C (BCLC-C) hepatocellular carcinoma 
      (HCC) patients who are not suitable for other loco-regional therapies. MATERIALS 
      AND METHODS: It is an observational retrospective study done between May 2020 and 
      September 2021. The data were collected from 35 patients of advanced HCC who 
      underwent SBRT. Patients of Child Pugh status (CPs) A5-B7 and with a liver 
      reserve of ≥ 700cc were included. Local control (LC), overall survival (OS) and 
      adverse events including decompensation were carefully recorded. RESULTS: In the 
      cohort, Portal vein and IVC tumor thrombosis were present in 33 (94.3%) and 
      8 (22.85%) patients, respectively. Lung and nodal metastasis were found in 
      11 (31.4%) and 21 (60%) of patients, respectively. The median gross tumor volume 
      (GTV) was 563cc (range 80-1925cc). The median SBRT dose prescription was 35 Gy 
      (range 25-40 Gy) in 5-10 fractions. Post radiation therapy, there was improvement 
      in pain and discomfort in 24 out of 29 (82.75%) and 18 out of 23 (78%) patients 
      respectively. Also bone metastasis related pain was improved in all 3 (100%) 
      patients. One year LC, and OS were 80% and 30% respectively. On multivariate 
      analysis, the GTV volume > 750cc and PIVKA-II > 8000 mAU/ml remained the 
      predictor factor for poor OS. Post SBRT, change in child-pugh score by 1 point 
      was observed in 7 patients (20%) which was managed conservatively. CONCLUSION: 
      SBRT is a safe and feasible option for BCLC‑C HCC. It not only improves the 
      quality of life by symptom control but also results in good LC and OS with 
      acceptable toxicity. SBRT should be considered in a multidisciplinary fashion for 
      patients presenting with advanced HCCs.

TI  - Anti-PD-L1 antibody TQB2450 combined with tyrosine kinase receptor inhibitor 
      AL2846 for immunotherapy-refractory advanced hepatocellular carcinoma and 
      esophageal squamous cell carcinoma: A prospective phase 1b cohort study.
PG  - 3137-3146
LID - 10.1002/cncr.35377 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Effective systemic therapy remains limited for advanced esophageal 
      squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), particularly 
      after prior failed treatment with immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs). 
      Theoretically, a combination of tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) with ICIs may 
      restore immunotherapy sensitivity. METHODS: In this phase 1b study, patients 
      received AL2846, an antiangiogenic TKI with multiple targets (c-MET, VEGFR1, 
      c-KIT, Axl, RET, KDR, and VEGFR3), in combination with an anti-PD-L1 antibody 
      (TQB2450) until disease progression, intolerable toxicity, death, or 
      discontinuation for any cause. The primary end points included overall response 
      rate (ORR) and safety, with secondary end points encompassing progression-free 
      survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), disease control rate (DCR), and duration 
      of response. RESULTS: Between November 2021 and September 2022, 18 patients with 
      ESCC and 15 patients with HCC, whose ORR was 11.1% (95% confidence interval [CI], 
      3.1%-32.8%) and 0%, respectively, were enrolled. Adverse events (AEs) of any 
      grade and treatment-related AEs were documented in 32 patients (97.0%) and 31 
      patients (93.9%), respectively. Grade 3 or higher AEs were observed in 10 
      patients (30.3%), with vomiting (6.1%) and infectious pneumonia (9.1%) being the 
      most prevalent. Median PFS and OS values were 3.22 months (95% CI, 1.35-5.68 
      months) and 5.98 months (95% CI, 3.71-8.87 months), respectively, in patients 
      with ESCC, and 5.55 months (95% CI, 2.66 months to not evaluable [NE]) and 16.72 
      months (95% CI, 4.86 months to NE), respectively, in patients with HCC. The DCRs 
      were 66.7% (95% CI, 43.75%-83.72%) in patients with ESCC and 73.3% (95% CI, 
      48.05%-89.10%) in patients with HCC. CONCLUSIONS: Combined TQB2450 and AL2846 
      therapy exhibited a favorable safety profile in immunotherapy-refractory patients 
      with advanced ESCC and HCC.

TI  - Liver Transplantation vs Partial Hepatectomy for Stage T2 Multifocal 
      Hepatocellular Carcinoma <3 cm Without Vascular Invasion: A Propensity 
      Score-Matched Survival Analysis.
PG  - 568-577
LID - 10.1097/XCS.0000000000000725 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Multifocal hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) differs biologically and 
      immunologically from single-nodule HCC. Asian and European guidelines consider 
      liver transplantation (LT) and partial hepatectomy (PH) as effective for T2 
      multifocal HCC, with preference toward LT, but few US studies compare these 
      treatments directly. This propensity score-based observational study uses an 
      established national cancer outcomes registry to compare overall survival in 
      patients undergoing PH and LT for multifocal HCC. STUDY DESIGN: Data from the 
      2020 National Cancer Database were obtained on patients who underwent LT or PH 
      for multifocal stage 2 HCC within Milan criteria and without vascular invasion. 
      Propensity score matching and Cox regression analysis was applied to evaluate 
      overall survival in an observational cohort balanced by age, sex, treatment 
      facility type, treatment year, prothrombin time, α-fetoprotein, comorbidity 
      burden, liver fibrosis severity, and pretreatment creatinine and bilirubin 
      levels. RESULTS: Of 21,248 T2 HCC patients identified, 6,744 had multifocal 
      tumors with largest tumor diameter <3 cm without major vascular invasion, with 
      1,267 and 181 having undergone LT and PH, respectively. Propensity score-matched 
      Cox regression analysis associated LT with a hazard ratio of 0.39 (95% CI 0.30 to 
      0.50) relative to PH. Landmark analyses to account for a longer interval to LT 
      demonstrated survival benefits of similar magnitude. CONCLUSIONS: Although 
      early-stage HCC can be effectively treated with either LT or PH, propensity 
      score-matched analysis comparatively shows a survival benefit for LT in patients 
      with multifocal HCC who are within the Milan criteria.

      prospective, phase 2 study.
PG  - 405-410
LID - 10.2478/raon-2023-0036 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The aim of the study was to observe the safety and efficacy of 
      anlotinib (ANL) alone or combined with S-1 in the first-line treatment of 
      advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). PATIENTS AND METHODS: Fifty-four 
      patients with untreated advanced HCC who could not be resected were randomly 
      divided into the ANL group (n = 27) and ANL+S-1 group (n = 27). The ANL group was 
      given 10 mg ANL orally once a day for 14 consecutive days, stopped for 1 week, 
      and repeated every 21 days. The ANL+S-1 group was given 10 mg ANL once a day 
      orally and 40 mg S-1 twice a day orally for 14 consecutive days, stopped for 1 
      week, repeated every 21 days. All patients were treated until the disease 
      progressed or toxicity became unacceptable. For patients who could not tolerate 
      adverse reactions, the ANL dose should be reduced to 8 mg per day. CT or MRI was 
      reviewed every 6 weeks to evaluate the efficacy. RESULTS: A total of 44 patients 
      were included in the results analysis, including 22 patients in the ANL group and 
      22 patients in the ANL+S-1 group. In the ANL group, the objective response rate 
      (ORR) was 4.5% (1/22), the disease control rate (DCR) was 77.3% (17/22), the 
      median progression-free survival (PFS) was 4.2 months (95% CI: 3.6-6.0) and the 
      median overall survival (mOS) was 7.0 months (95% CI: 6.3-9.0). In the ANL+S-1 
      group, the ORR was 18.2% (4/22), the DCR was 59.1% (13/22), the median PFS was 
      4.0 months (95% CI: 3.6-5.4) and the mOS was 6.0 months (95% CI: 5.5-7.4). There 
      was no significant difference in ORR (p = 0.345) or DCR (p = 0.195) between the 
      two groups. Adverse reactions were mainly hypertension, anorexia, fatigue, liver 
      transaminase heightened and hand and foot skin reaction. CONCLUSIONS: ANL 
      monotherapy was effective in the treatment of advanced HCC, and adverse reactions 
      have been able to tolerated.

TI  - Effectiveness of a nurse-led decision counselling programme on hepatocellular 
      carcinoma screening uptake among patients with hepatitis B: A randomised 
      controlled trial.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The globally endemic hepatocellular carcinoma induced by hepatitis B 
      highlights the need for an ultrasonography-based screening strategy to reduce the 
      tumour burden. However, patient non-adherence due to unawareness and complex 
      decisions in weighting uncertainties of hepatocellular carcinoma screening has 
      continuously challenged its continuum. OBJECTIVE: To examine the effectiveness 
      and process of a nurse-led decision counselling programme for improving 
      hepatocellular carcinoma screening among patients with hepatitis B. DESIGN: 
      Single-blind randomised controlled trial. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: Between 12 
      March and 19 July 2021, 178 patients with hepatitis B were recruited from six 
      inpatient wards of a university-affiliated hospital in northern China. METHODS: 
      Participants were randomly allocated to receive usual care (n = 89) or usual care 
      plus a nurse-led decision counselling programme (n = 89). Underpinned by the 
      preventive health model, the programme consisted of health education, tailored 
      information, and values clarification exercises to elicit informed and 
      value-based preferences for hepatocellular carcinoma screening. Screening 
      barriers were explored and addressed through procedural problem-solving. 
      Hepatocellular carcinoma screening rate at six months post-baseline was the 
      primary outcome. Secondary outcomes (knowledge, perceptions, and decision 
      conflicts regarding hepatocellular carcinoma screening) were measured at baseline 
      (T0), immediately after the intervention (T1), and the six-month follow-up (T2). 
      A Medical Research Council framework-guided process evaluation was conducted by 
      drawing on data from intervention documentation, WeChat discussions, and 
      interviews with stakeholders (n = 13). RESULTS: With a mean age of 47.32 (8.78) 
      years, participants mostly occupied rural residences (63.5 %). Compared with the 
      control group, the intervention group had significantly higher hepatocellular 
      carcinoma screening rates (75.6 % vs. 42.1 %, p < 0.001) and displayed greater 
      improvements in the scores of hepatocellular carcinoma screening knowledge 
      (β = 3.643, 95 % confidence interval [CI] = 3.030, 4.255), salience and coherence 
      (β = 0.410, 95 % CI = 0.234, 0.586), response efficacy (β = 0.327, 95 % 
      CI = 0.181, 0.473), and perceived susceptibility (β = 0.214, 95 % CI = 0.040, 
      0.388) at T1. Improvement in perceived susceptibility was not maintained, whereas 
      a higher decrease of the decision conflict score was found at T2 (β = -4.156, 
      95 % CI = -7.851, -0.461). The process evaluation revealed potential intervention 
      mechanisms and contextual factors affecting intervention effectiveness, such as 
      living status and natural disasters. CONCLUSION: The programme was effective in 
      improving hepatocellular carcinoma screening and showed that nurses could play a 
      decision counselling role in optimising the screening among patients with 
      hepatitis B. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.govNCT04659005. Registration 
      date: 9 December, 2020. TWEETABLE ABSTRACT: Nurse-led decision counselling 
      improves hepatocellular carcinoma screening in patients with hepatitis B.

TI  - A Phase 1a/1b Study of Fostroxacitabine Bralpamide (Fostrox) Monotherapy in 
      Hepatocellular Carcinoma and Solid Tumor Liver Metastases.
PG  - 2033-2047
LID - 10.2147/JHC.S481410 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: To evaluate safety, preliminary efficacy, pharmacokinetics, and 
      pharmacodynamics, of fostroxacitabine bralpamide (fostrox, MIV-818), a novel oral 
      troxacitabine nucleotide prodrug designed to direct exposure to the liver, while 
      minimizing systemic toxicity. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Fostrox monotherapy was 
      administered in an open-label, single-arm, first-in-human, phase 1a/1b study, in 
      patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma, or 
      solid tumor liver metastases. The first part (1a) consisted of 
      intra/inter-patient escalating doses (3 mg to 70 mg) QD for up to 5 days, and the 
      second part (1b), doses of 40 mg QD for 5 days, in 21-day cycles. Safety and 
      tolerability were evaluated by the Safety Review Committee, and efficacy was 
      assessed every 6 weeks with CT or MRI using RECIST 1.1 and mRECIST. RESULTS: 
      Nineteen patients were treated with fostrox. Most common adverse events (AEs) 
      were hematological and increased AST. Grade 3 treatment related AEs (TRAE) were 
      seen in 53% of the patients, with transient neutropenia and thrombocytopenia as 
      the most common. No grade 5 AE was observed. Recommended Phase 2 dose of fostrox 
      was 40 mg QD for 5 days in 21-day cycles. Preliminary efficacy showed a clinical 
      benefit rate in the liver of 53% and stable disease (SD) as best response in 10 
      patients. Liver targeting with fostrox was confirmed with higher exposure of 
      troxacitabine and its metabolites in liver compared to plasma. Systemic exposure 
      of fostrox was generally low with troxacitabine as main analyte. Biopsies 
      demonstrated tumor-selective, drug-induced DNA damage. CONCLUSION: The phase 
      1a/1b monotherapy study of fostrox, in patients with liver tumors, showed a tumor 
      selective effect in the liver and that 40 mg QD for 5 days in 21-day cycles is 
      safe and tolerable. Safety and preliminary efficacy in patients with advanced HCC 
      supports clinical development of fostrox in combination with other modes of 
      action in HCC.

TI  - Statin use and the risk of hepatocellular carcinoma among patients with chronic 
      hepatitis B: an emulated target trial using longitudinal nationwide population 
      cohort data.

AB  - BACKGROUND: No randomized controlled trials have been completed to see whether 
      statin can decrease hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) risk in chronic hepatitis B 
      (CHB) patients. We used large-scale, population-based, observational data to 
      emulate a target trial with two groups, statin user and statin non-user. METHODS: 
      Among 1,379,708 nonunique individuals from the Korean National Health Insurance 
      Service data, 2,915 CHB patients with serum cholesterol level of 200 mg/dL or 
      higher who started statin therapy and 8,525 propensity-score matched CHB patients 
      with serum cholesterol level of 200 mg/dL or higher who did not start statin 
      therapy were analyzed for the development of HCC. In addition, liver cancer or 
      liver-related mortality and all-cause mortality were assessed. RESULTS: During 
      follow-up, 207 participants developed HCC. Incidence rate of HCC was 0.2 per 
      1,000 person-years in the statin user group and 0.3 per 1,000 person-years in the 
      statin non-user group. Fully adjusted hazard ratio (HR) for incident HCC 
      comparing statin user group to statin nonuser group was 0.56 (95% confidence 
      interval [CI]: 0.39 to 0.80). The association between statin use and decreased 
      HCC risk was consistent in all subgroups analyzed. Fully adjusted HR comparing 
      statin user to statin nonuser was 0.59 (95% CI: 0.35 to 0.99) for liver cancer or 
      liver-related mortality and 0.93 (95% CI: 0.78 to 1.11) for all-cause mortality. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Statin might have a benefit for preventing HCC in CHB patients with 
      elevated cholesterol levels. Statin should be actively considered for CHB 
      patients with dyslipidemia.

TI  - Transarterial Chemoembolization with Epirubicin-Loaded Microspheres for 
      Hepatocellular Carcinoma: A Prospective, Single-Arm, Multicenter, Phase 2 Study 
      (STOPPER Trial).
PG  - 325-336

AB  - PURPOSE: While the role of drug-eluting beads transarterial chemoembolization 
      (DEB-TACE) for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is established, questions regarding 
      appropriate bead size for use in patients remain. This trial evaluated the 
      effectiveness and safety of DEB-TACE using small-size (≤ 100 μm) microspheres 
      loaded with epirubicin. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This prospective, single-arm, 
      multicenter study enrolled patients diagnosed with HCC who underwent DEB-TACE 
      using 40 (range, 30-50), 75 (range, 60-90), or 100 (range, 75-125) μm 
      epirubicin-loaded microspheres (TANDEM microspheres, Varian Medical). Bead size 
      was at the discretion of treating physicians and based on tumor size and/or 
      vascular structure. The primary outcome measure was 6-month objective response 
      rate (ORR). Secondary outcome measures were 30-day and 3-month ORR, time to tumor 
      progression and extrahepatic spread, proportion of progression-free survival and 
      overall survival (OS) at one year, and incidence of treatment-associated adverse 
      events. RESULTS: Data from 108 patients from ten centers was analyzed. Six-month 
      ORR was 73.3 and 71.3% based on European association for the study of the liver 
      (EASL) and modified response evaluation criteria in solid tumors (mRECIST) 
      criteria, respectively. Thirty-day ORR was 79.6% for both EASL and mRECIST 
      criteria with 3-month ORR being 80.0 and 81.0%, respectively, for each criteria. 
      One-year PPF and OS rate were 60.3 and 94.3%. There was a total of 30 SAEs 
      reported to be likely to definitely associated with microsphere (n = 9), 
      epirubicin (n = 9), or procedure (n = 12) with none resulting in death. 
      CONCLUSION: DEB-TACE using epirubicin-loaded small-sized (≤ 100 μm) microspheres 
      demonstrates promising local tumor control and acceptable safety in patients with 
      HCC. TRIAL REGISTRATION: Clinicaltrials.gov NCT03113955; registered April 14,

TI  - Radiation Therapy With Combination Therapy of Immune Checkpoint Inhibitors and 
      Antiangiogenic Therapy for Hepatocellular Carcinoma.

AB  - PURPOSE: Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) combined with antiangiogenic therapy 
      have limited efficacy in treating advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The 
      synergistic effect of systemic therapy and radiation therapy (RT) might resolve 
      this problem. We aimed to investigate the effect of RT on the treatment outcomes 
      of ICIs and antiangiogenic combination therapy in patients with advanced-stage 
      HCC. METHODS AND MATERIALS: This retrospective observational study analyzed the 
      medical records of 194 patients with Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer stage C HCC 
      who were admitted to our center from August 2018 to June 2022 and received ICIs 
      combined with antiangiogenic therapy as the first-line treatment. Patients who 
      were administered RT for tumor thrombus or symptomatic metastases within 8 weeks 
      of the commencement of combination therapy were allocated to the RT group, 
      whereas those who did not receive RT were assigned to the non-radiation therapy 
      (NRT) group. Propensity score matching was used to mitigate selection bias. The 
      primary endpoints were progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS). 
      The secondary endpoints included objective response rate, disease control rate 
      (DCR), local PFS, out-of-field PFS, and treatment-related adverse events. 
      RESULTS: A total of 76 patients diagnosed with advanced-stage HCC and treated 
      with ICIs and antiangiogenic therapy were included in the study, with 33 patients 
      in the RT group and 43 patients in the non-RT group. After propensity score 
      matching, 29 matched patient pairs were generated. The median follow-up was 15.5 
      months, and the RT sites were mainly located on the tumor thrombus (55.2%) and 
      extrahepatic metastatic lesions (48.3%). The median PFS was 8.3 months (95% CI, 
      5.4-11.3) in the RT group and 4.2 months (95% CI, 3.4-5.0) in the NRT group (P < 
      .001). The median OS was not reached in the RT group and was 9.7 months (95% CI, 
      4.1-15.3) in the NRT group (P = .002). The objective response rate was 75.9% (95% 
      CI, 56.5-89.7) in the RT group and 24.1% (95% CI, 10.3-43.5) in the NRT group (P 
      < .001). The DCR was 100% in the RT group and 75.9% (95% CI, 56.5-89.7) in the 
      NRT group (P = .005). The median local PFS and out-of-field PFS were 13.2 months 
      (95% CI, 6.3-20.1) and 10.8 months (95% CI, 7.0-14.7), respectively. RT was an 
      independent prognostic factor for PFS (hazard ratio = 0.33; 95% CI, 0.17-0.64; P 
      < .001) and OS (hazard ratio = 0.28; 95% CI, 0.11-0.68; P = .005), respectively. 
      The rates of any grade treatment-related adverse events were similar between the 
      2 groups. CONCLUSIONS: In comparison to the combination of ICIs and 
      antiangiogenic therapy, the inclusion of RT has been observed to improve the DCR 
      and survival outcomes in patients with advanced-stage HCC. The safety profile of 
      this triple therapy was satisfactory.

AB  - Malignant ascites is a common complication resulting from the peritoneal spread 
      of malignancies, and currently lacks effective treatments. We conducted a phase 
      II trial (NCT04771676) to investigate the efficacy and safety of oncolytic 
      adenovirus H101 and virotherapy-induced immune response in 25 patients with 
      malignant ascites. Oncolytic virotherapy achieved an increased median time to 
      repeat paracentesis of 45 days (95% confidence interval 16.5-73.5 days), compared 
      with the preset control value of 13 days. Therapy was well-tolerated, with 
      pyrexia, fatigue, nausea, and abdominal pain as the most common toxicities. 
      Longitudinal single-cell profiling identified marked oncolysis, early virus 
      replication, and enhanced CD8(+) T cells-macrophages immune checkpoint crosstalk, 
      especially in responsive patients. H101 also triggered a proliferative burst of 
      CXCR6(+) and GZMK(+)CD8(+) T cells with promoted tumor-specific cytotoxicity. 
      Further establishment of oncolytic virus-induced T cell expansion signature 
      (OiTE) implicated the potential benefits for H101-responsive patients from 
      subsequent anti-PD(L)1 therapy. Patients with upregulated immune-signaling 
      pathways in tumor cells and a higher proportion of CLEC10A(+) dendritic cells and 
      GZMK(+)CD8(+) T cells at baseline showed a superior response to H101 treatment. 
      Our study demonstrates promising clinical responses and tolerability of oncolytic 
      adenovirus in treating malignant ascites and provides insights into the relevant 
      cellular processes following oncolytic virotherapy.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Therapeutic options for early-stage hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in 
      individual patients can be limited by tumor and location, liver dysfunction and 
      comorbidities. Many patients with early-stage HCC do not receive curative-intent 
      therapies. Stereotactic ablative body radiotherapy (SABR) has emerged as an 
      effective, non-invasive HCC treatment option, however, randomized evidence for 
      SABR in the first line setting is lacking. METHODS: Trans-Tasman Radiation 
      Oncology Group (TROG) 21.07 SOCRATES-HCC is a phase II, prospective, randomised 
      trial comparing SABR to other current standard of care therapies for patients 
      with a solitary HCC ≤ 8 cm, ineligible for surgical resection or transplantation. 
      The study is divided into 2 cohorts. Cohort 1 will compromise 118 patients with 
      tumors ≤ 3 cm eligible for thermal ablation randomly assigned (1:1 ratio) to 
      thermal ablation or SABR. Cohort 2 will comprise 100 patients with tumors > 3 cm 
      up to 8 cm in size, or tumors ≤ 3 cm ineligible for thermal ablation, randomly 
      assigned (1:1 ratio) to SABR or best other standard of care therapy including 
      transarterial therapies. The primary objective is to determine whether SABR 
      results in superior freedom from local progression (FFLP) at 2 years compared to 
      thermal ablation in cohort 1 and compared to best standard of care therapy in 
      cohort 2. Secondary endpoints include progression free survival, overall 
      survival, adverse events, patient reported outcomes and health economic analyses. 
      DISCUSSION: The SOCRATES-HCC study will provide the first randomized, multicentre 
      evaluation of the efficacy, safety and cost effectiveness of SABR versus other 
      standard of care therapies in the first line treatment of unresectable, 
      early-stage HCC. It is a broad, multicentre collaboration between hepatology, 
      interventional radiology and radiation oncology groups around Australia, 
      coordinated by TROG Cancer Research. TRIAL REGISTRATION: anzctr.org.au,

AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: The effectiveness of adjuvant immunotherapy to diminish 
      recurrence and improve long-term prognosis following curative-intent surgical 
      resection for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is of increased interest, especially 
      among individuals at high risk of recurrence. The objective of the current study 
      was to investigate the impact of adjuvant immunotherapy on long-term recurrence 
      and survival after curative resection among patients with intermediate/advanced 
      HCC. METHODS: Using a prospectively-collected multicenter database, patients who 
      underwent curative-intent resection for Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC) 
      stage B/C HCC were identified. Propensity score matching (PSM) analysis was used 
      to compare recurrence-free survival (RFS) and overall survival (OS) between 
      patients treated with and without adjuvant immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs). 
      Multivariate Cox-regression analysis further identified independent factors of 
      RFS and OS. RESULTS: Among the 627 enrolled patients, 109 patients (23.3%) 
      received adjuvant immunotherapy. Most ICI-related adverse reactions were grading 
      I-II. PSM analysis created 99 matched pairs of patients with comparable baseline 
      characteristics between patients treated with and without adjuvant immunotherapy. 
      In the PSM cohort, the median RFS (29.6 vs. 19.3 months, P=0.031) and OS (35.1 
      vs. 27.8 months, P=0.036) were better among patients who received adjuvant 
      immunotherapy versus patients who did not. After adjustment for other confounding 
      factors on multivariable analyzes, adjuvant immunotherapy remained independently 
      associated with favorable RFS (HR: 0.630; 95% CI: 0.435-0.914; P=0.015) and OS 
      (HR: 0.601; 95% CI: 0.401-0.898; P=0.013). Subgroup analyzes identified 
      potentially prognostic benefits of adjuvant immunotherapy among patients with 
      intermediate-stage and advanced-stage HCC. CONCLUSION: This real-world 
      observational study demonstrated that adjuvant immunotherapy was associated with 
      improved RFS and OS following curative-intent resection of intermediate/advanced 
      HCC. Future randomized controlled trials are warranted to establish definitive 
      evidence for this specific population at high risks of recurrence.

TI  - Safety and dose escalation of the targeted oncolytic adenovirus OBP-301 for 
      refractory advanced liver cancer: Phase I clinical trial.

AB  - OBP-301 is an oncolytic adenovirus modified to replicate within cancer cells and 
      lyse them. This open-label, non-comparative, phase I dose-escalation trial aimed 
      to assess its safety and optimal dosage in 20 patients with advanced 
      hepatocellular carcinoma. Good tolerance was shown with a maximum tolerated dose 
      of 6 × 10(12) viral particles. The most common treatment-emergent adverse events 
      were influenza-like illness, pyrexia, fatigue, decreased platelet count, 
      abdominal distension, and anemia. Cohorts 4 and 5 had approximately 50% higher 
      levels of CD8+ T cells in the peripheral blood after injection. The best target 
      response occurred in 14 patients, 4 of whom had progressive disease. Multiple 
      intratumoral injections of OBP-301 were well tolerated in patients with advanced 
      hepatocellular carcinoma. The stable disease rate for the injected tumors was 
      greater than the overall response rate, even with no obvious tumor response. 
      OBP-301 might have a greater impact on local response as histological examination 
      revealed that the presence of OBP-301 was consistent with the necrotic area at 
      the injection site. Increased infiltration of CD8+ T cells and <1% PD-L1 
      expression were observed in tumors after injection. Improved antitumor efficacy 
      might be achieved in future studies via viral injection with volume adjustment 
      and in combination with other immuno-therapeutics.

TI  - Proton beam radiotherapy versus transarterial chemoembolization for 
      hepatocellular carcinoma: Results of a randomized clinical trial.
PG  - 3554-3563
LID - 10.1002/cncr.34965 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: This study compares survival rates, recurrence patterns, toxicity, 
      and treatment cost in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) treated with 
      either transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) or proton beam radiotherapy (PBT). 
      METHODS: Subjects with untreated HCC meeting Milan or San Francisco transplant 
      criteria were recruited. Subjects were randomized to receive PBT (n = 36) or TACE 
      (n = 40). Proton therapy was administered in 15 fractions over 3 weeks to a total 
      dose of 70.2 Gy. TACE was repeated until complete or maximal response. The 
      primary outcome measure was overall survival (OS). Secondary end points were 
      progression-free survival (PFS), local control (LC), toxicity, and cost. RESULTS: 
      Of the 76 randomized patients, 74 were assessed for outcome measures. The 2-year 
      OS for PBT versus TACE was similar at 68%, 95% confidence interval (CI), 
      0.54-0.86, and 65%, 95% CI, 0.52-0.83 (p = .80), however, median PFS was improved 
      for PBT versus TACE (not reached vs. 12 months, p = .002). LC was improved with 
      PBT versus TACE (hazard ratio, 5.64; 95% CI, 1.78-17.9, p = .003). Days of 
      posttreatment hospitalization were 24 for PBT and 166 for TACE (p < .001). Total 
      mean cost per patient for treatment and posttreatment care revealed a 28% cost 
      savings for PBT. CONCLUSIONS: PBT and TACE yielded similar OS for treatment of 
      HCC, but PFS and LC were improved with PBT compared to TACE. Patients treated 
      with PBT required fewer courses of treatment, fewer posttreatment hospitalization 
      days, and reduced cost of treatment compared to TACE. These data support the use 
      of PBT as a viable treatment alternative to TACE for patients with HCC within 
      transplant criteria.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Advanced primary liver cancer patients with malignant ascites have a 
      poor prognosis and lack effective treatment plans. This phase Ib study aims to 
      explore the safety and clinical efficacy of intraperitoneal anti-programmed cell 
      death protein 1 (PD-1) antibody in these patients. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients 
      received sintilimab 100 mg intraperitoneally plus best supportive care on days 1, 
      8, and 15 in three cycles of 4 weeks. The course was repeated every 28 days until 
      intolerable toxicity had developed or disease progression. The primary endpoint 
      was safety, while the secondary endpoints were objective response rate (ORR), 
      ascites control rate (ACR), and overall survival (OS). RESULTS: From February 
      2021 through November 2022, a total of 21 patients (14 hepatocellular carcinoma 
      and 7 cholangiocarcinoma) were enrolled to receive intraperitoneal sintilimab. 
      Twelve patients had adverse events (AEs). The most common grade 3 AEs were 
      fatigue, rash, and abdominal pain. No grade ≥4 AEs occurred in any patients. ORR 
      was only evaluated in 13 patients, including partial response in 4, stable 
      disease in 7, and progressive disease in 2. A reduction in the median maximum 
      diameter of the tumor after treatment was observed; however, there was no 
      statistical significance among patients. The objective remission rate of ascites 
      was 43.75%, and the median OS for all 21 patients was 17.6 weeks. CONCLUSIONS: 
      This exploratory study represents the first trial to demonstrate the safety and 
      clinical efficacy of intraperitoneal anti-PD-1 antibody administration. No 
      unexpected safety concerns were identified. A large, multicenter, prospective 
      study is needed to confirm the promising clinical efficacy.

TI  - A Pilot Study of Pembrolizumab in Combination With Y90 Radioembolization in 
      Subjects With Poor Prognosis Hepatocellular Carcinoma.
PG  - 270-e413
LID - 10.1093/oncolo/oyad331 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Combination checkpoint inhibition therapy with yttrium-90 (Y90) 
      radioembolization represents an emerging area of interest in the treatment of 
      advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). HCRN GI15-225 is an open-label, 
      single-arm multicenter, pilot study (NCT03099564). METHODS: Eligible patients had 
      poor prognosis, localized HCC defined as having portal vein thrombus, multifocal 
      disease, and/or diffuse disease that were not eligible for liver transplant or 
      surgical resection. Patients received pembrolizumab 200 mg intravenously every 3 
      weeks in conjunction with glass yttrium-90 (Y90) radioembolization TheraSphere. 
      Primary endpoint was 6-month progression-free survival (PFS6) per RECIST 1.1. 
      Secondary endpoints included time to progression (TTP), objective response rate 
      (ORR), overall survival (OS), and safety/tolerability. RESULTS: Between October 
      23, 2017 and November 24, 2020, 29 patients were enrolled: 2 were excluded per 
      protocol. Fifteen of the remaining 27 patients were free of progression at 6 
      months (55.6%; 95% CI, 35.3-74.5) with median PFS 9.95 months (95% CI, 
      4.14-15.24) and OS 27.30 months (95% CI, 10.15-39.52). One patient was not 
      evaluable for response due to death; among the remaining 26 patients, ORR was 
      30.8% (95% CI, 14.3-51.8) and DCR was 84.6% (95% CI, 65.1-95.6). CONCLUSION: In 
      patients with localized, poor prognosis HCC, pembrolizumab in addition to glass 
      Y90 radioembolization demonstrated promising efficacy and safety consistent with 
      prior observations (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT03099564; IRB Approved: 
      16-3255 approved July 12, 2016).

TI  - Association between gut microbiota and seven gastrointestinal diseases: A 
      Mendelian randomized study.
PG  - e3623
LID - 10.1002/jgm.3623 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Observational research has shed light on the ability of gut microbes 
      to influence the onset and progression of gastrointestinal diseases. The causal 
      relationships between specific gut microbiomes and various gastrointestinal 
      conditions, however, remain unknown. METHODS: We investigated the relationship 
      between gut microbiota and seven specific gastrointestinal disorders using a 
      robust two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) approach. The inverse 
      variance-weighted (IVW) method was used as the primary analysis tool in our 
      study. Furthermore, we conducted multiple sensitivity analyses to strengthen the 
      robustness of our findings and ensure the reliability of the IVW method. RESULTS: 
      Our research has discovered significant links between the composition of gut 
      microbiota and a variety of gastrointestinal ailments. We found compelling links 
      between 13 gut microbiota and fatty liver, four gut microbiota and cirrhosis, 
      eight gut microbiota and hepatocellular carcinoma, four gut microbiota and 
      cholelithiasis, 12 gut microbiota and acute pancreatitis, eight gut microbiota 
      and chronic pancreatitis, and 11 gut microbiota and pancreatic cancer. These 
      findings shed light on the intricate relationship between gut microbes and the 
      emergence of these specific gastrointestinal conditions. CONCLUSIONS: The 
      findings of this extensive study not only validate the potential role of specific 
      gut microbiota in gastrointestinal diseases, but also fill a critical gap in 
      previous research. The discovery of these specific gut microbiota is a 
      significant step forward because they may serve as novel and promising biomarkers 
      for both the prevention and treatment of gastrointestinal conditions.

TI  - Sintilimab, bevacizumab biosimilar, and HAIC for unresectable hepatocellular 
      carcinoma conversion therapy: a prospective, single-arm phase II trial.
PG  - 811-818
LID - 230806N413 [pii]
LID - 10.4149/neo_2023_230806N413 [doi]
AB  - We assessed the efficacy and safety of sintilimab [an anti-programmed death 
      (PD-1)] plus bevacizumab biosimilar (IBI305), and hepatic arterial infusion 
      chemotherapy (HAIC) in patients with unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). 
      The patients received sintilimab (200 mg) plus IBI305 (7.5 mg/kg) and HAIC 
      (FOLFOX for 23 h) and were treated every 3 weeks. The primary endpoint was the 
      objective response rate (ORR) assessed by an independent review committee (IRC) 
      per mRECIST v1.1. Twenty-nine patients were enrolled in our clinical trial (1 
      patient voluntarily withdrew due to adverse events after the initial treatment). 
      Objective response was reached in 17/29 (58.6%) patients per mRECIST. A total of 
      19/29 (65.5%) patients became eligible for further treatment; 14 of them 
      completed surgical resection; 1 (5.3%) achieved pathological complete response 
      (pCR); and 5 (26.3%) reached major partial response (mPR). The 1-year OS rate was 
      better in the PR or pCR+mPR+PR group than in the PD+SD group by either mRECIST or 
      pathological assessment (p=0.039 and 0.006). The 1-year EFS rate was better in 
      the PR group than in the PD+SD group by pathological assessment (p=0.007). The 
      most common treatment-related adverse events (TEAEs) in 30 HCC patients included 
      thrombocytopenia (40.0%), hypertension (23.3%), and leukopenia (23.3%). The grade 
      3-5 TEAEs that were observed were hypertension (10%), diarrhea (6.7%), asthenia 
      (3.3%), and ascites (3.3%). Sintilimab plus IBI305 and HAIC showed promising 
      efficacy and manageable safety in patients with unresectable HCC. It might 
      represent a novel treatment option for these patients.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Conversion therapy for initially unresectable hepatocellular 
      carcinoma (iuHCC) using lenvatinib combined with transcatheter arterial 
      chemoembolization (TACE) plus a PD-1 inhibitor (LTP) has achieved promising 
      results. However, further comparative research is necessary to evaluate the 
      effectiveness and safety of conversion surgery (CS) for iuHCC. METHODS: Data for 
      32 consecutive patients with iuHCC receiving CS and 419 consecutive patients with 
      resectable HCC receiving initial surgery (IS) between November 2019 and September 
      2022 were collected retrospectively. After propensity score matching (PSM), 65 
      patients were selected. RESULTS: Before matching, the CS group had longer EFS 
      (not reached vs. 12.9 months, P < 0.001) and similar OS (not reached vs. not 
      reached, P = 0.510) compared with the IS group. Similar results for EFS (P = 
      0.001) and OS (P = 0.190) were obtained after matching. The multivariable Cox 
      model (HR = 0.231, 95% CI: 0.105-0.504; P < 0.001) and subgroup analyses 
      confirmed that CS could improve EFS. The CS group had significantly lower 
      incidence of microvascular invasion (MVI) than the IS group (3.1% vs. 50.4%, P < 
      0.001). Moreover, the two groups had similar safety profiles. CONCLUSIONS: CS is 
      effective and safe for patients with iuHCC receiving LTP. LTP has the potential 
      to reduce risk factors for postoperative recurrence, especially MVI, which may 
      influence surgical decision-making.

TI  - Effects of Interventions for Improving Awareness and Knowledge of Nonalcoholic 
      Fatty Liver Disease Among Chinese Young Adults for Prevention of Liver Cancer-A 
      Randomized Controlled Trial.
PG  - 253-263
LID - 10.1007/s13187-024-02404-1 [doi]
AB  - Chinese young adults (CYA), who are at an increasing risk of developing 
      nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), which in turn increases the risk of 
      liver cancer, are an ideal target population to deliver educational interventions 
      to improve their awareness and knowledge of NAFLD and consequently reduce their 
      risk of developing NAFLD. The purpose of this study was to determine the efficacy 
      of two interventions to improve awareness and knowledge of NAFLD among CYA for 
      the prevention of liver cancer. Between May and July 2021, 1373 undergraduate 
      students aged 18 to 25 years in one university in China completed a web-based, 
      self-administered survey distributed through WeChat app. One week after 
      completion of the baseline survey, all eligible participants were randomly 
      assigned to a pamphlet, a video intervention, or no intervention (control group), 
      with follow-up assessments immediately and 1-month post-intervention. The 7-page 
      pamphlet or 6.5-min video had information on NAFLD. Self-assessments included 
      NAFLD awareness, lean NAFLD awareness, and knowledge scores of NAFLD. About 26% 
      of participants had NAFLD awareness at baseline. Compared with controls, 
      participants in both interventions showed significant improvement of awareness of 
      NAFLD (pamphlet, + 46.0%; video, + 44.3%; control, + 18.7%; OR [95% CI], 3.13

TI  - Association of dietary insulinemic and inflammatory potential with risk of liver 
      cancer and chronic liver disease mortality in postmenopausal women: a prospective 
      cohort study.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Low diet quality, diabetes, and chronic inflammation are risk factors 
      of liver cancer and chronic liver disease (CLD), but the extent to which 
      insulinemic and inflammatory diets are independently associated with risk of 
      liver cancer and CLD mortality is unknown. METHODS: We conducted a prospective 
      cohort analysis among 78,356 postmenopausal women in the Women's Health 
      Initiative Observational Study. Two validated dietary indices, the empirical 
      dietary index for hyperinsulinemia (EDIH) and the empirical dietary inflammation 
      pattern (EDIP), were estimated from a food-frequency questionnaire. Incident 
      cases of liver cancer and CLD mortality were adjudicated via review of medical 
      records and linkage to National Death Index. Multivariable hazard ratios (HRs) 
      with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated using Cox proportional 
      hazards models, adjusted for age, diabetes, body mass index, and other 
      covariates. RESULTS: During a median 22.1 y of follow-up, we documented 176 
      primary liver cancer cases and 156 CLD mortality cases. EDIH was positively 
      associated with incident liver cancer (HR(Quartile 4 vs. Quartile 1) = 1.68; 95% 
      CI: 1.00, 2.83; P-trend = 0.05) and CLD mortality (HR(Q4 vs. Q1) = 2.28; 95% CI: 
      1.25, 4.15; P-trend = 0.02) in the multivariable model. EDIP was also positively 
      associated with liver cancer (HR(Q4 vs. Q1) = 1.88; 95% CI: 1.17, 3.03; P-trend = 
      0.009) and CLD mortality (HR(Q4 vs. Q1) = 1.85; 95% CI: 1.09, 3.15; P-trend = 
      0.007). Estimates remained significant and robust in sensitivity analyses. 
      Further analyses indicated positive associations for refined grains, processed 
      meat, sugary beverages, and eggs, and inverse associations for coffee/tea and 
      poultry. CONCLUSIONS: Dietary insulinemic and inflammatory potentials were 
      independently associated with higher risk of liver cancer and CLD mortality in 
      U.S. postmenopausal women. These findings suggest a potential role for diet 
      modification to reduce risk of liver cancer and CLD.

TI  - Female and diabetes are risk factors for alpha-fetoprotein and protein induced by

AB  - Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a common type of tumor with a high incidence. 
      Alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) and protein induced by vitamin K absence or antagonist-II 
      (PIVKA-II or des-gamma-carboxy prothrombin) are proven effective biomarkers for 
      HCC. Combining them can enhance detection rates. However, when both AFP and 
      PIVKA-II are negative, clinical diagnosis may be missed. This study aims to 
      explore the risk factors for AFP and PIVKA-II negativity in HCC, thereby reducing 
      missed diagnoses. A retrospective study enrolled 609 HCC patients at Shandong 
      Public Health Clinical Center Affiliated with Shandong University from January 
      2010 to March 2022. Patients with negative AFP and PIVKA-II were the observed 
      group, and others with at least 1 positive were controls. Epidemiological, 
      clinical, laboratory, and radiological data were collected and analyzed to 
      identify the frequency and factors influencing AFP and PIVKA-II negativity. 
      Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were used to assess the prediction 
      model's ability to detect negative AFP and PIVKA-II in HCC. Gender (P = .045, 95% 
      confidence interval [95%CI] = 1.013-3.277), diabetes mellitus (P = .018, 
      95%CI = 1.151-4.422), tumor size (P = .000, 95%CI = 0.677-0.841), glutamate 
      transpeptidase (P = .003, 95%CI = 0.239-0.737), total bilirubin (P = .001, 
      95%CI = 0.235-0.705), and hepatitis B virus-associated infections (P = .007, 
      95%CI = 0.077-0.661) were significantly associated with AFP and PIVKA-II 
      negativity in HCC. The prediction model had an area under curve of 0.832 
      (P < .001, 95%CI = 0.786-0.877), with a sensitivity of 81.2% and specificity of 
      75.5% in all HCC patients. Female diabetic patients with levels closer to normal 
      for glutamate transpeptidase and total bilirubin are more likely to develop AFP 
      and PIVKA-II-negative HCC. Imaging is crucial for screening liver cancer in these 
      patients.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Lenvatinib is widely used in treatment of unresectable hepatocellular 
      carcinoma (uHCC), but the benefit of its combination with immunotherapy needs to 
      be verified. This study evaluated the efficacy and safety of tislelizumab plus 
      lenvatinib in systemic treatment-naïve patients with uHCC. METHODS: In this 
      multicenter, single-arm, phase 2 study, systemic treatment-naïve patients with 
      uHCC received tislelizumab 200 mg every three weeks plus lenvatinib 
      (bodyweight ≥ 60 kg: 12 mg; < 60 kg: 8 mg; once daily). Dose-limiting toxicities 
      (DLTs) were evaluated in safety run-in phase to determine whether to enter the 
      expansion phase. The primary endpoint was objective response rate (ORR) assessed 
      by independent review committee (IRC) per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid 
      Tumors, version 1.1 (RECIST v1.1). Based on Simon's two-stage design, > 6 
      responders were needed in stage 1 (n = 30) to continue the study, and ≥ 18 
      responders were needed by the end of stage 2 (n = 60) to demonstrate statistical 
      superiority to a historical control of lenvatinib monotherapy. RESULTS: 
      Sixty-four patients were enrolled. No DLTs were reported. The study achieved 
      statistical superiority (p = 0.0003) with 23 responders assessed by IRC per 
      RECIST v1.1 in the first 60 patients of the efficacy evaluable analysis set 
      (n = 62). After a median follow-up of 15.7 months, confirmed ORR and disease 
      control rate were 38.7% (24/62, 95% confidence interval [CI], 26.6-51.9) and 
      90.3% (56/62, 95% CI, 80.1-96.4), respectively. Median progression-free survival 
      was 8.2 months (95% CI, 6.8-not evaluable). Overall survival rate at 12 months 
      was 88.6% (95% CI, 77.7-94.4). Grade ≥ 3 treatment-related adverse events 
      occurred in 18 (28.1%) patients. CONCLUSIONS: Tislelizumab plus lenvatinib 
      demonstrated promising antitumor activity with favourable tolerability as 
      first-line therapy for patients with uHCC. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov 
      (NCT04401800).

AB  - BACKGROUND The effects of a low graft-to-recipient weight ratio (GRWR) on the 
      prognosis of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) are unclear. The 
      present study examined whether the GRWR had an impact on the rate of HCC 
      recurrence following living donor liver transplantation (LDLT). MATERIAL AND 
      METHODS This retrospective observational single-center study included 856 
      patients who underwent LDLT for HCC between January 2006 and December 2016 at 
      Asan Medical Center and evaluated the association between GRWR and 
      post-transplant tumor recurrence. RESULTS Of the 856 patients who underwent LDLT 
      for HCC, 54 (6.3%), 272 (31.8%), 274 (32.0%), and 256 (29.9%) had GRWR <0.8%, 
      0.8-0.99%, 1.0-1.19%, and ≥1.2%, respectively. Analysis of all patients revealed 
      that the disease-free survival (DFS; P=0.545) and overall survival (OS; P=0.313) 
      rates were not different in these 4 groups. Subgroups analyses also showed that 
      GRWR did not influence survival rates in patients within (DFS: P=0.398; OS: 
      P=0.676) and beyond (DFS: P=0.602; OS: P=0.649) the Milan criteria, or in 
      patients with alpha-fetoprotein-des-γ-carboxyprothrombin-tumor volume scores 
      <5log (DFS: P=0.633; OS: p=0.285) and ≥5log (DFS: P=0.674; OS: P=0.906). 
      CONCLUSIONS GRWR less than 0.8% did not demonstrate a noteworthy prognostic 
      influence on the oncological results among patients who had undergone LDLT for 
      HCC. High-volume multi-center studies are necessary to validate these findings.

AB  - PURPOSE: To investigate the clinical relevance of serum chemokine ligand 14 
      (sCCL14) in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and the effect of 
      transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) on the expression level of sCCL14 and the 
      immune microenvironment. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this prospective single-center 
      observational study, 52 patients with HCC were recruited from January 2019 to 
      December 2021, their clinical data and blood samples were collected, and the 
      relationship between sCCL14 and progression-free survival (PFS) and TACE 
      treatment response was analyzed. RESULTS: Among the 52 patients with HCC 
      (Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer [BCLC] Stage A, 25.0%; BCLC Stage B, 44.2%; and 
      BCLC Stage C, 30.8%), patients with BCLC Stage C HCC had significantly lower 
      sCCL14 levels than those of patients with BCLC Stages A and B HCC (P = .001). 
      sCCL14 levels were significantly higher in the first week after treatment than 
      before TACE treatment (P = .024). Baseline sCCL14 levels in patients who showed 
      complete response after TACE treatment were significantly higher than those in 
      other groups, and lower baseline sCCL14 values were associated with shorter PFS 
      times. Multivariate Cox regression analysis showed that sCCL14 level (hazard 
      ratio, 1.855; 95% CI, 1.039-3.311; P = .037) was an independent prognostic factor 
      of PFS. sCCL14 levels negatively correlated with the proportion of B lymphocytes 
      and regulatory T cells in circulating blood and positively correlated with the 
      absolute T-lymphocyte count. CONCLUSIONS: sCCL14 may be a predictive biomarker of 
      TACE effectiveness. Further studies are needed to validate and outline the role 
      of combination immunotherapy.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to investigate the relationship between circulating 
      cytokines and liver function and prognosis of patients with advanced 
      hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) treated with radiotherapy combined with 
      tislelizumab and anlotinib. The liver function indexes and pre-treatment levels 
      of cytokines in 47 patients were measured by chemical method and flow cytometry. 
      The median follow-up was 23.1 months. The objective response and the disease 
      control rates were 46.8% and 68.1%, while overall survival (OS) and 
      progression-free survival (PFS) were 12.6 and 11.4 months, respectively. Adverse 
      events (2.1%) were grade 3-4. In addition to stage, intrahepatic metastasis and 
      Child-Pugh score, pre-treatment interleukin-6 (IL-6) was the main cytokine 
      affecting OS and PFS (p < 0.05). The OS (14.63 pg/mL as cutoff value) and PFS 
      (9.85 pg/mL as cutoff value) of patients with low IL-6 levels exceeded those with 
      high levels (21.0 and 6.9, 15.8 and 10.0 months, respectively). The risks of 
      death and disease progression were reduced by 63.0% (HR = 0.37, 95% CI: 
      0.19-0.72) and 43.0% (HR = 0.57, 95% CI: 0.22-1.47), respectively. Pre-treatment 
      IL-6 levels may be a simple and effective prognostic indicator for patients with 
      advanced HCC treated with radiotherapy combined with immunotargeted therapy.

AB  - Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients with macrovascular invasion (MVI) have 
      dismal prognosis and there are no standard perioperative therapies. This phase 2 
      trial (ChiCTR2000036385) aimed to investigate the activity and safety of 
      perioperative tislelizumab plus intensity modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) for 
      resectable HCC with MVI. Thirty treatment-naïve patients with MVI received 3 
      cycles of tislelizumab intravenously (200 mg, every three weeks) and concurrent 
      IMRT (45 Gray in 15 fractions). Primary endpoints were the overall response rate 
      (ORR) and overall survival (OS). Secondary endpoints were the proportion of 
      patients with a complete or major pathological response (pCR or MPR), 
      recurrence-free survival (RFS) and safety. Of patients enrolled, 15 (50%) 
      underwent curative surgery followed by adjuvant tislelizumab. The ORR was 30.0% 
      (90% CI 16.6%-46.5%) and the median OS was 18.7 months. Of the 15 patients 
      underwent surgical resection, 10 (66.7%) achieved pCR or MPR and 8 (53.3%) 
      remained recurrence-free. The median RFS were not reached with a median follow-up 
      of 21.77 months (95% CI 12.50-31.03) post-surgery. 4 (13.3%) patients experienced 
      grade 3 treatment-related adverse events. The most common events were 
      thrombocytopenia, leukopenia, and anemia. The trial has met the pre-specified 
      endpoints, and these results support further studies of perioperative 
      immunotherapy plus radiotherapy in HCC.

TI  - Recompensation after TIPS reduces the incidence of hepatocellular carcinoma and 
      increases survival in patients with cirrhosis.
PG  - 3072-3082
LID - 10.1111/liv.16095 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: It has been described that recompensation can improve 
      prognosis in patients with cirrhosis. However, recompensation after transjugular 
      intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) has not been studied. We evaluated the 
      impact of recompensation after TIPS on the risk of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) 
      and death, and we compared it with compensated cirrhosis patients. METHODS: An 
      observational study of consecutive patients with cirrhosis undergoing TIPS 
      between 2008 and 2022 was performed. Baveno VII definition of recompensation was 
      used including patients with or without diuretics/Hepatic encephalopathy 
      prophylaxis. A prospective cohort of consecutive compensated cirrhosis patients 
      was used for comparison. RESULTS: Overall, 208 patients with cirrhosis were 
      included, 92 compensated and 116 decompensated who underwent TIPS. After 1 year, 
      24% achieved recompensation. Liver function (MELD 12 ± 5 vs. 15 ± 6; p = .049), 
      LDL-cholesterol (97 mg/dL vs. 76 mg/dL, p = .018), white cell count 
      (7.96 × 10(9)/dL vs. 6.24 × 10(9)/dL, p = .039) and platelets (129 × 10(9)/dL vs. 
      101 × 10(9)/dL, p = .039) were associated with recompensation. Recompensation was 
      associated with a reduction in the risk of HCC (p = .020). Multivariable analysis 
      showed that this risk was significantly higher in non-recompensated patients 
      (p = .003) but no differences were observed in recompensated compared with 
      compensated patients (p = .816). Similarly, decompensated patients presented 
      lower survival rates (p = .011), while no differences were observed between 
      recompensated and compensated patients (p = .677). CONCLUSIONS: Recompensation 
      after TIPS has a clear impact on the incidence of HCC and death, with a similar 
      prognosis than patients with compensated cirrhosis. Liver function is associated 
      with recompensation, suggesting the importance of considering early TIPS in 
      patients with indication.

AB  - To examine the comparative robustness of computed tomography (CT)-based 
      conventional radiomics and deep-learning convolutional neural networks (CNN) to 
      predict overall survival (OS) in HCC patients. Retrospectively, 114 HCC patients 
      with pretherapeutic CT of the liver were randomized into a development (n = 85) 
      and a validation (n = 29) cohort, including patients of all tumor stages and 
      several applied therapies. In addition to clinical parameters, image annotations 
      of the liver parenchyma and of tumor findings on CT were available. 
      Cox-regression based on radiomics features and CNN models were established and 
      combined with clinical parameters to predict OS. Model performance was assessed 
      using the concordance index (C-index). Log-rank tests were used to test 
      model-based patient stratification into high/low-risk groups. The clinical 
      Cox-regression model achieved the best validation performance for OS (C-index 
      [95% confidence interval (CI)] 0.74 [0.57-0.86]) with a significant difference 
      between the risk groups (p = 0.03). In image analysis, the CNN models (lowest 
      C-index [CI] 0.63 [0.39-0.83]; highest C-index [CI] 0.71 [0.49-0.88]) were 
      superior to the corresponding radiomics models (lowest C-index [CI] 0.51 
      [0.30-0.73]; highest C-index [CI] 0.66 [0.48-0.79]). A significant risk 
      stratification was not possible (p > 0.05). Under clinical conditions, 
      CNN-algorithms demonstrate superior prognostic potential to predict OS in HCC 
      patients compared to conventional radiomics approaches and could therefore 
      provide important information in the clinical setting, especially when clinical 
      data is limited.

PG  - 3032-3041
LID - 10.1097/JS9.0000000000000554 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Nucleot(s)ide analog treatment (entecavir (ETV) and tenofovir (TDF)) 
      is reported to be associated with decreased tumor recurrence and death in 
      hepatitis B virus (HBV)-related hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients, yet 
      further work is needed to evaluate the different efficacies of these two agents 
      on the prognosis of early-stage HBV-related HCC patients after curative liver 
      resection. MATERIAL AND METHODS: From July 2017 to January 2019, 148 patients 
      with HBV-related HCC who underwent curative liver resection were randomized to 
      receive TDF ( n =74) or ETV ( n =74) therapy. The primary end point was tumor 
      recurrence in the intention-to-treat population. Overall survival and tumor 
      recurrence of patients were compared by multivariable-adjusted Cox regression and 
      competing risk analyses. RESULTS: During the follow-up with continued antiviral 
      therapy, 37 (25.0%) patients developed tumor recurrence, and 16 (10.8%) patients 
      died ( N =15) or received liver transplantation ( N =1). In the 
      intention-to-treat cohort, the recurrence-free survival for the TDF group was 
      significantly better than that for the ETV group ( P =0.026). In the multivariate 
      analysis, the relative risks of recurrence and death/liver transplantation for 
      ETV therapy were 3.056 (95% CI: 1.015-9.196; P =0.047) and 2.566 (95% CI: 
      1.264-5.228; P =0.009), respectively. Subgroup analysis of the PP population 
      indicated a better overall survival and RFS of patients receiving TDF therapy ( P 
      =0.048; hazard ratio (HR) =0.362; 95% CI: 0.132-0.993 and P =0.014; HR =0.458; 
      95% CI: 0.245-0.856). Additionally, TDF therapy was an independent protective 
      factor against late tumor recurrence ( P =0.046; (HR)=0.432; 95% CI: 0.189-0.985) 
      but not against early tumor recurrence ( P =0.109; HR =1.964; 95% CI: 
      0.858-4.494). CONCLUSION: HBV-related HCC patients treated with consistent TDF 
      therapy had a significantly lower risk of tumor recurrence than those treated 
      with ETV after curative treatment.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Health warnings about alcohol consumption could inform consumers and 
      discourage alcohol consumption, but little is known about what topics these 
      warnings should address. We sought to identify promising topics for alcohol 
      warnings. METHODS: In January 2024, we recruited a convenience sample of 2,522 US 
      adults ages ≥ 21 years. In an online within-subjects experiment, participants 
      viewed messages about 6 topics (5 warning topics selected from a pool of 16 
      topics [e.g., liver disease, liver cancer] and 1 control topic [i.e., recycling 
      or reselling products]) shown in random order. For each topic, participants 
      viewed and rated 2 statements about that topic on perceived message effectiveness 
      (primary outcome) and reactance (secondary outcome). RESULTS: The 16 warning 
      topics elicited higher perceived message effectiveness than the control topic 
      (ps < 0.001). Among the warning topics, liver disease, most cancer types, 
      dementia or mental decline, and hypertension elicited the highest perceived 
      message effectiveness, while breast cancer, sleep, and drinking guidelines 
      elicited the lowest. Fourteen of the 16 warning topics (all except for fetal 
      harms and impaired driving) elicited more reactance than the control topic 
      (ps < 0.001). Warning topics that elicited high perceived message effectiveness 
      generally elicited high reactance, except for messages about liver disease and 
      liver cancer, which elicited high perceived message effectiveness but only 
      moderate reactance. DISCUSSION: Warning messages about a variety of topics hold 
      promise for discouraging alcohol consumption. Messages about liver disease, most 
      cancer types, dementia or mental decline, and hypertension are perceived as 
      especially effective; however, none of these topics are included in the current 
      US alcohol warning.

AB  - BACKGROUND: To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of Tislelizumab vs Sorafenib as 
      the first-line treatment of unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) from the 
      perspective of the Chinese health service system. METHODS: A lifetime partitioned 
      survival model (PSM) was developed to cost-effectively analyze Tislelizumab vs 
      Sorafenib as the first-line treatment of unresectable HCC. The clinical and 
      safety data were derived from a recently randomized clinical trial 
      (RATIONALE-301). Utilities were collected from the published literature. Costs 
      were obtained from an open-access database (http://www.yaozh.com) and previous 
      studies. The model cycle was 21 days, according to the RATIONALE-301 study, and 
      the simulation period was patients' lifetime. Long-term direct medical costs and 
      quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) were determined. The incremental 
      cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) was used as the evaluation index. one-way 
      sensitivity analysis (OSWA) and probabilistic sensitivity analysis (PSA) were 
      used to analyze the uncertainty of parameters and to adjust and verify the 
      stability of the baseline results. RESULTS: The Tislelizumab group generated a 
      cost of $39,746.34 and brought health benefits to 2.146 QALYs, while the cost and 
      utility of the Sorafenib group were $26750.95 and 1.578 QALYs, respectively. The 
      Tislelizumab group increased QALYs by 0.568, the incremental cost was $12995.39, 
      and the ICER was $22869.64/QALY, lower than the willingness to pay threshold 
      (WTP). OSWA results showed that the utility of progressed disease (PD), cost of 
      Camrelizumab, and cost of Tislelizumab were the main factors affecting the ICER. 
      PSA results showed that, within 1000 times the Monte Carlo simulation, the cost 
      of the Tislelizumab group was lower than three times the per capita gross 
      domestic product (GDP) of China ($37653/QALY). The cost-effectiveness 
      acceptability curves (CEAC) revealed that when WTP was no less than $12251.00, 
      the Tislelizumab group was the dominant scheme, and the economic advantage grew 
      with an increasing WTP. When WTP ≥ $19000.00, the Tislelizumab group became the 
      absolute economic advantage. CONCLUSION: Under the current economic conditions in 
      China, the Tislelizumab therapeutic scheme is more cost-effective than the 
      Sorafenib therapeutic scheme for treating patients with unresectable HCC.

TI  - Liver resection for hepatocellular and fibrolamellar carcinoma in a South African 
      tertiary referral centre - an observational cohort analysis.
PG  - 13-17
AB  - BACKGROUND: More than 80% of global hepatocellular carcinomas (HCC) occur in 
      sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) and South- East Asia. Compared with the rest of the 
      world, HCC in SSA has the lowest resection and survival rates. This study 
      assessed outcome following liver resection for HCC and fibrolamellar carcinoma 
      (FLC) at a tertiary referral centre in South Africa. METHODS: A retrospective 
      analysis was done of all liver resections for HCC and FLC at Groote Schuur 
      Hospital and the University of Cape Town Private Academic Hospital between 
      January 1990 and December 2021. Three groups were compared, (i) HCC occurring in 
      normal livers, (ii) HCC occurring in cirrhotic livers, and (iii) fibrolamellar 
      carcinoma. Postoperative complications were classified as per the expanded 
      accordion severity grading system. Median overall survival (OS) and 95% 
      confidence intervals (CI) were calculated. RESULTS: Forty-eight patients were 
      included in the study, 25 for HCC in non-cirrhotic livers, 15 in cirrhotic livers 
      and eight for FLC. Thirty-six patients (75%) underwent a major resection. No 
      mortality occurred but 16 patients (33%) developed grade 1 to 4 complications 
      postoperatively. Thirty-three patients (69%) developed recurrence of HCC 
      following their initial resection of whom 29 (60%) ultimately died. Median 
      overall survival (OS) for the total cohort after surgery was 57.2 months, 95% CI 
      (29.7-84.6), 64.2 months (29.7-84.6), 61.9 months (28.1-95.6), and 31.7 months 
      (1.5-61.8) for patients with HCC in non-cirrhotic livers, FLC and HCC in 
      cirrhotic livers respectively. CONCLUSION: Liver resection for HCC and FLC was 
      safe with no mortality, but one-third of patients had associated postoperative 
      morbidity. The high long-term recurrence rate remains a major obstacle in 
      achieving better survival results after resection.

TI  - Carvedilol Plus NUC for Patients With HBV-Compensated Cirrhosis Under Virological 
      Suppression: A Randomized Open-Label Trial.
PG  - 700-711
LID - 10.14309/ajg.0000000000002569 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Portal hypertension progression can be relieved after controlling 
      the etiology of liver cirrhosis. Whether beta-blockers could additionally enhance 
      the effects during treatment, particularly for small esophageal varices (EV), was 
      unclear. This study aims to assess the efficacy of add-on carvedilol to delay EV 
      progression during anti-hepatitis B virus (HBV) treatment in HBV-related 
      cirrhosis. METHODS: This randomized controlled trial enrolled patients with 
      virologically suppressed HBV-compensated cirrhosis and small/medium EV. The 
      participants were randomly assigned to receive nucleos(t)ide analog (NUC) or 
      carvedilol 12.5 mg plus NUC (1:1 allocation ratio). The primary end point was the 
      progression rate of EV at 2 years of follow-up. RESULTS: A total of 238 patients 
      (small EV, 77.3%) were randomized into 119 NUC and 119 carvedilol plus NUC 
      (carvedilol [CARV] combination group). Among them, 205 patients (86.1%) completed 
      paired endoscopies. EV progression rate was 15.5% (16/103) in the NUC group and 
      12.7% (13/102) in the CARV combination group (relative risk = 0.79, 95% 
      confidence interval 0.36-1.75, P = 0.567). Subgroup analysis on medium EV showed 
      the CARV combination group had a more favorable effect in promoting EV regression 
      (43.5% vs 13.1%, P = 0.022) than NUC alone, but not in small cases ( P = 0.534). 
      The incidence of liver-related events (decompensation, hepatocellular carcinoma, 
      or death/liver transplantation) within 2 years was similar between the 2 groups 
      (11.2% vs 10.4%, P = 0.881). DISCUSSION: The overall results did not show 
      statistically significant differences between the added carvedilol strategy and 
      NUC monotherapy in preventing EV progression in patients with virologically 
      suppressed HBV-compensated cirrhosis. However, the carvedilol-added approach 
      might offer improved outcomes specifically for patients with medium EV 
      (NCT03736265).

TI  - Preoperative dexamethasone administration in hepatectomy of 25-min intermittent 
      Pringle's maneuver for hepatocellular carcinoma: protocol for a randomized 
      controlled trial.
PG  - 774
LID - 10.1186/s13063-023-07820-0 [doi]
LID - 774
AB  - BACKGROUND: Our previous randomized controlled trial (RCT) have demonstrated that 
      intermittent Pringle's maneuver (IPM) with a 25-min ischemic interval can be 
      applied safely and efficiently in open or laparoscopic hepatectomy in patients 
      with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients. But prolonging the hepatic inflow 
      blocking time will inevitably aggravate the ischemia-reperfusion injury (IRI) 
      caused by systemic response. This RCT aims to evaluate the effect of 
      administration of dexamethasone versus placebo before clamping the hilar pedicle 
      on postoperative liver function, inflammatory response, and perioperative 
      outcomes among HCC patients undergoing liver resection with 25-min hepatic inflow 
      occlusion. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: This will be a randomized, dual-arm, 
      parallel-group, double-blinded trial. All eligible and consecutive patients are 
      coming from a regional medical center who are diagnosed with HCC and underwent 
      radical R0/R1 resection. All participates are randomly allocated in dexamethasone 
      group or placebo group. All surgeons, anesthesiologists, and outcome assessors 
      will be blinded to allocation status. Primary endpoints are transaminase-based 
      postoperative hepatic injury on seven consecutive days after surgery and assessed 
      by their peak values as well as area under the curve (AUC) of the postoperative 
      course of aminotransferases. Secondary endpoints are postoperative total 
      bilirubin (TBil), coagulation function, inflammatory cytokines and their 
      respective peaks, intraoperative blood loss, postoperative hospital stay, 
      morbidity, and mortality. The above parameters will be compared using the 
      corresponding statistical approach. Subgroup analysis will be performed according 
      to the liver cirrhosis and major hepatectomy. DISCUSSION: Based on our previous 
      study, we will explore further the effect of glucocorticoid administration on 
      attenuating the surgical stress response in order to follow securely 25-min 
      hepatic inflow occlusion. Therefore, the trial protocol is reasonable and the 
      results of the trial may be clinically significant. TRIAL REGISTRATION: This 
      trial was registered on 3 December 2022, in the Chinese Clinical Trial Registry ( 
      http://www.chictr.org.cn ), ChiCTR2200066381. The protocol version is V1.0 
      (20221104).

TI  - Preoperative Diagnosis of Dual-Phenotype Hepatocellular Carcinoma Using Enhanced 
      MRI Radiomics Models.
PG  - 1185-1196
LID - 10.1002/jmri.28391 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Dual-phenotype hepatocellular carcinoma (DPHCC) is highly aggressive 
      and difficult to distinguish from hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). PURPOSE: To 
      develop and validate clinical and radiomics models based on contrast-enhanced MRI 
      for the preoperative diagnosis of DPHCC. STUDY TYPE: Retrospective. POPULATION: A 
      total of 87 patients with DPHCC and 92 patients with non-DPHCC randomly divided 
      into a training cohort (n = 125: 64 non-DPHCC; 61 DPHCC) and a validation cohort 
      (n = 54: 28 non-DPHCC; 26 DPHCC). FIELD STRENGTH/SEQUENCE: A 3.0 T; dynamic 
      contrast-enhanced MRI with time-resolved T1-weighted imaging sequence. 
      ASSESSMENT: In the clinical model, the maximum tumor diameter and hepatitis B 
      virus (HBV) were independent risk factors of DPHCC. In the radiomics model, a 
      total of 1781 radiomics features were extracted from tumor volumes of interest 
      (VOIs) in the arterial phase (AP) and portal venous phase (PP) images. For 
      feature reduction and selection, Pearson correlation coefficient (PCC) and 
      recursive feature elimination (RFE) were used. Clinical, AP, PP, and combined 
      radiomics models were established using machine learning algorithms (support 
      vector machine [SVM], logistic regression [LR], and logistic regression-least 
      absolute shrinkage and selection operator [LR-LASSO]) and their discriminatory 
      efficacy assessed and compared. STATISTICAL TESTS: The independent sample t test, 
      Mann-Whitney U test, Chi-square test, regression analysis, receiver operating 
      characteristic curve (ROC) analysis, Pearson correlation analysis, the Delong 
      test. A P value < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. RESULTS: In the 
      validation cohort, the combined radiomics model (area under the curve 
      [AUC] = 0.908, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.831-0.985) showed the highest 
      diagnostic performance. The AUCs of the PP (AUC = 0.879, 95% CI: 0.779-0.979) and 
      combined radiomics models were significantly higher than that of clinical model 
      (AUC = 0.685, 95% CI: 0.526-0.844). There were no significant differences in AUC 
      between AP or PP radiomics model and combined radiomics model (P = 0.286, 0.180 
      and 0.543). CONCLUSION: MRI radiomics models may be useful for discriminating 
      DPHCC from non-DPHCC before surgery. EVIDENCE LEVEL: 4 TECHNICAL EFFICACY: Stage 
      2.

AB  - Evidences regarding the feasibility of transcatheter arterial chemoembolization 
      (TACE)-based therapy for unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (uHCC) remains 
      limited. This study aimed to investigate the efficacy and safety of TACE combined 
      with envafolimab and lenvatinib for uHCC. Eligible patients with uHCC received 
      envafolimab and lenvatinib after TACE until disease progression, conversion to 
      surgery, intolerable toxicities, or death. The primary endpoint was the objective 
      response rate (ORR) assessed according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid 
      Tumors (RECIST) 1.1 criteria. Between March 2022 and July 2022, 38 patients were 
      included for safety analysis, and 36 patients were included for efficacy 
      analysis. As of the data cutoff (13 December 2023), the median follow-up was 16.9 
      months. The ORR was 50%, and disease control rate (DCR) was 83.3% per RECIST 1.1 
      (ORR and DCR of both 83.3% per modified RECIST (mRECIST)). The median 
      progression-free survival (PFS) was 7.58 months. Of 36 patients, 17 patients were 
      converted to resectable HCC with a surgical conversion rate of 47.2%, and 16 
      patients underwent surgery with R0 resection rate of 100%, pathologic complete 
      response (pCR) rate of 31.3%. Overall incidences of treatment-related adverse 
      events (TRAEs) of any grade was 97.4%. Grade ≥ 3 TRAEs were observed in 52.6% 
      patients. No treatment-related deaths occurred. Image mass cytometry (IMC) 
      analysis revealed that combined treatment improved the immune status of the tumor 
      microenvironment, and resident macrophages had the potential to predict efficacy 
      of this treatment. Envafolimab plus lenvatinib and TACE yielded promising 
      survival outcomes and conversion efficiency with a tolerable safety profile.

AB  - Aim: To evaluate a novel antisense oligonucleotide drug targeting human IGF-1R in 
      preclinical and phase I studies of liver cancer.Materials & methods: The 
      tolerability and safety of an investigational new drug were evaluated in a 
      dose-escalation trial involving 17 patients with advanced liver cancer after 
      preclinical assessment of pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics.Results: The drug 
      exposure levels in the phase I trial were determined by the in vivo efficacy with 
      pharmacokinetics evaluation in rats and rhesus monkeys. This clinical study 
      showed that the maximum tolerated dose was 3.96 mg/kg, and the dose-limiting 
      toxicity dose was 4.4 mg/kg.Conclusion: The drug was safe and tolerable in 
      patients with advanced liver cancer.Clinical Trial Registration: ChiCTR2100044235

OAB - CT102 is a potential new drug for liver cancer treatment. It belongs to a new 
      form of medicine using gene therapy technology called antisense oligonucleotides. 
      There are some antisense oligonucleotides approved for treating rare diseases. 
      This study evaluated the antitumor effect, metabolism and safety of CT102 in 
      preclinical and clinical trials. The results showed that CT102 could inhibit 
      tumor growth in mice with liver cancer and maintain high levels in the liver. It 
      was found that CT102 was safe and tolerable in patients with advanced liver 
      cancer. This suggests that CT102 has therapeutic potential for liver cancer 
      treatment. The good tolerability and safety of CT102 in patients supports further 
      studies on liver cancer treatment.

TI  - Long-Term Overall Survival After Selective Internal Radiation Therapy for Locally 
      Advanced Hepatocellular Carcinomas: Updated Analysis of DOSISPHERE-01 Trial.
PG  - 264-269
LID - 10.2967/jnumed.123.266211 [doi]
AB  - Interim analysis of the DOSISPHERE-01 study demonstrated a strong improvement in 
      response and overall survival (OS) on using (90)Y-loaded glass microspheres with 
      personalized dosimetry compared with standard dosimetry in patients with 
      nonoperable locally advanced hepatocellular carcinoma. This report sought to 
      provide a long-term analysis of OS. Methods: In this phase II study 
      (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier NCT02582034), treatment was randomly assigned 
      (1:1) with the goal to deliver either at least 205 Gy (if possible >250-300 Gy) 
      to the index lesion in the personalized dosimetry approach (PDA) or 120 ± 20 Gy 
      to the treated volume in the standard dosimetry approach (SDA). The 3-mo response 
      of the index lesion was the primary endpoint, with OS being one of the secondary 
      endpoints. This report is a post hoc long-term analysis of OS. Results: Overall, 
      60 hepatocellular carcinoma patients with at least 1 lesion larger than 7 cm and 
      more than 30% of hepatic reserve were randomized (intent-to-treat population: 
      PDA, n = 31; SDA, n = 29), with 56 actually treated (modified intent-to-treat 
      population: n = 28 in each arm). The median follow-up for long-term analysis was 
      65.8 mo (range, 2.1-73.1 mo). Median OS was 24.8 mo and 10.7 mo (hazard ratio 
      [HR], 0.51; 95% CI, 0.29-0.9; P = 0.02) for PDA and SDA, respectively, in the 
      modified intent-to-treat population. Median OS was 22.9 mo for patients with a 
      tumor dose of at least 205 Gy, versus 10.3 mo for those with a tumor dose of less 
      than 205 Gy (HR, 0.42; 95% CI, 0.22-0.81; P = 0.0095), and was 22.9 mo for 
      patients with a perfused liver dose of 150 Gy or higher, versus 10.3 mo for those 
      with a perfused liver dose of less than 150 Gy (HR, 0.42; 95% CI, 0.23-0.75; P = 
      0.0033). Lastly, median OS was not reached in patients who were secondarily 
      resected (n = 11, 10 in the PDA group and 1 in the SDA group), versus 10.8 mo in 
      those without secondary resection (n = 45) (HR, 0.17; 95% CI, 0.065-0.43; P = 
      0.0002). Only resected patients displayed favorable long-term OS rates, meaning 
      an OS of more than 50% at 5 y. Conclusion: After longer follow-up, personalized 
      dosimetry sustained a meaningful improvement in OS, which was dramatically 
      improved for patients who were accurately downstaged toward resection, including 
      most portal vein thrombosis patients.

TI  - Safety and Preliminary Efficacy of Pembrolizumab Following Transarterial 
      Chemoembolization for Hepatocellular Carcinoma: The PETAL Phase Ib Study.
PG  - 2433-2443
LID - 10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-24-0177 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) may prime adaptive immunity and 
      enhance immunotherapy efficacy. PETAL evaluated safety, preliminary activity of 
      TACE plus pembrolizumab and explored mechanisms of efficacy. PATIENTS AND 
      METHODS: Patients with liver-confined hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) were planned 
      to receive up to two rounds of TACE followed by pembrolizumab 200 mg every 21 
      days commencing 30 days post-TACE until disease progression or unacceptable 
      toxicity for up to 1 year. Primary endpoint was safety, with assessment window of 
      21 days from pembrolizumab initiation. Secondary endpoints included 
      progression-free survival (PFS) and evaluation of tumor and host determinants of 
      response. RESULTS: Fifteen patients were included in the safety and efficacy 
      population: 73% had nonviral cirrhosis; median age was 72 years. Child-Pugh class 
      was A in 14 patients. Median tumor size was 4 cm. Ten patients (67%) received 
      pembrolizumab after one TACE; 5 patients after two (33%). Pembrolizumab yielded 
      no synergistic toxicity nor dose-limiting toxicities post-TACE. Treatment-related 
      adverse events occurred in 93% of patients, most commonly skin rash (40%), 
      fatigue, and diarrhea (27%). After a median follow-up of 38.5 months, objective 
      response rate 12 weeks post-TACE was 53%. PFS rate at 12 weeks was 93% and median 
      PFS was 8.95 months [95% confidence interval (CI): 7.30-NE (not estimable)]. 
      Median duration of response was 7.3 months (95% CI: 6.3-8.3). Median overall 
      survival was 33.5 months (95% CI: 11.6-NE). Dynamic changes in peripheral T-cell 
      subsets, circulating tumor DNA, serum metabolites, and in stool bacterial 
      profiles highlight potential mechanisms of action of multimodal therapy. 
      CONCLUSIONS: TACE plus pembrolizumab was tolerable with no evidence of 
      synergistic toxicity, encouraging further clinical development of immunotherapy 
      alongside TACE.

TI  - Efficacy of dexamethasone and N-acetylcysteine combination in preventing 
      post-embolization syndrome after transarterial chemoembolization in 
      hepatocellular carcinoma.
PG  - 890-903

AB  - BACKGROUND: Conventional transarterial chemoembolization (cTACE) is the current 
      standard treatment for intermediate-stage hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). 
      Post-embolization syndrome (PES) is complex clinical syndrome that presents as 
      fever, abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting. Either dexamethasone (DEXA) or 
      N-acetylcysteine (NAC) is used to prevent PES; however, the synergistic effect of 
      their combined therapy for preventing PES and liver decompensation has not been 
      determined. AIM: To evaluate the efficacy of DEXA and NAC combination in 
      preventing PES and liver decompensation after cTACE. METHODS: Patients with 
      Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer stage A or B HCC who were scheduled for TACE were 
      prospectively enrolled. All patients were randomly stratified to receive NAC and 
      DEXA or placebo. The dual therapy (NAC + DEXA) group received intravenous 
      administration of 10 mg DEXA every 12 h, NAC 24 h prior to cTACE (150 mg/kg/h for 
      1 h followed by 12.5 mg/kg/h for 4 h), and a continuous infusion of 6.25 mg/h NAC 
      plus 4 mg DEXA every 12 h for 48 h after cTACE. The placebo group received an 
      infusion of 5% glucose solution until 48 h after procedure. PES was defined by 
      South West Oncology Group toxicity code grading of more than 2 that was 
      calculated using incidence of fever, nausea, vomiting, and pain. RESULTS: 
      One-hundred patients were enrolled with 50 patients in each group. Incidence of 
      PES was significantly lower in the NAC + DEXA group compared with in the placebo 
      group (6% vs 80%; P < 0.001). Multivariate analysis showed that the dual 
      treatment is a protective strategic therapy against PES development [odds ratio 
      (OR) = 0.04; 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.01-0.20; P < 0.001). Seven (14%) 
      patients in the placebo group, but none in the NAC + DEXA group, developed 
      post-TACE liver decompensation. A dynamic change in Albumin-Bilirubin score of 
      more than 0.5 point was found to be a risk factor for post-TACE liver 
      decompensation (OR = 42.77; 95%CI: 1.01-1810; P = 0.049). CONCLUSION: Intravenous 
      NAC + DEXA administration ameliorated the occurrence of PES event after cTACE in 
      patients with intermediate-stage HCC.

TI  - Apatinib plus hepatic arterial infusion of oxaliplatin and raltitrexed for 
      hepatocellular carcinoma with extrahepatic metastasis: phase II trial.

AB  - Most patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) ultimately experience 
      tumor progression after first-line systemic therapies. Systemic therapy is 
      generally recommended as second-line treatment for advanced HCC in the major 
      guidelines. Combining apatinib with hepatic arterial infusion chemotherapy (HAIC) 
      likely drives synergistic activity on advanced HCC with extrahepatic metastasis. 
      This phase II trial (ChiCTR2000029082) aimed to assess efficacy and safety of 
      this combination in patients with HCC with extrahepatic metastasis who have 
      progressed after first-line systemic therapies. The primary end point was the 
      objective response rate (ORR). The secondary endpoints were progress-free 
      survival (PFS), disease control rate (DCR), 6- and 12-month survival rates, 
      overall survival (OS), and adverse events (AEs). Thirty-nine patients received 
      oral treatment with apatinib, and hepatic artery infusion oxaliplatinplus 
      raltitrexed. Per RECIST v1.1, the ORR and DCR was 53.8% and 89.7% in the patients 
      population, respectively. The median PFS and OS was 6.2 months and 11.3 months, 
      respectively. The 6- and 12-month survival rates were 81.7% and 44.1%, 
      respectively. All AEs were manageable by medication or dose modifications. 
      Apatinib plus HAIC for second-line therapy in advanced HCC with extrahepatic 
      metastasis shows promising efficacy and manageable toxicities.

AB  - RATIONALE AND OBJECTIVES: Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) treatment often requires 
      transarterial chemoembolization (TACE). However, TACE efficacy is controversial 
      in the presence of portal vein thrombosis (PVT). Although transarterial 
      radioembolization (TARE) benefit was previously documented in PVT, neither the 
      objective tumor response (OTR) after TARE with Iodine-131-lipiodol 
      ((131)I-lipiodol) nor the PVT effect on the results of locoregional therapies was 
      accurately measured in prospective clinical trials. The aim of this study was to 
      compare OTR and survival obtained by TARE with (131)I-lipiodol versus TACE in 
      patients with cirrhosis and HCC, as well as between those with and without PVT. 
      MATERIALS AND METHODS: 33 patients were included, from whom 38 tumors were 
      assessed. OTR was quantified by a special algorithm to measure hypervascular HCC 
      tissue. RESULTS: 19 tumors received each therapy. Nine subjects (27%) had PVT, 
      most of them in the TARE group (p = 0.026). Mean OTR according to the tumor 
      volumes was 24.2% ± 56% after TARE and 32.8% ± 48.9% after TACE, with no 
      difference between the treatments (p = 0.616). Similar values were also observed 
      between those with and without PVT (p = 0.704). Mean survival was 340 days and 
      did not differ between the two treatments (p = 0.596), but was 194 days in PVT 
      cases (p = 0.007). CONCLUSIONS: This is the first study in which OTR obtained by 
      TARE with (131)I-lipiodol is accurately measured. Additionally, PVT impact on 
      survival after TARE and TACE was precisely documented. Although the TARE group 
      had more PVT subjects (who had shorter survival), TARE and TACE achieved similar 
      OTR and OS rates.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIM: Less than 25 % of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) occurs in 
      women, in whom prognosis could be better. Due to the lack of date in Europe, this 
      study aims to assess survival of patients with HCC according sex in a tertiary 
      French liver center. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Every patient diagnosed with a first 
      diagnosis of HCC presented at our weekly multidisciplinary tumor board between 
      2013 and 2017 were included. Baseline characteristics of patients and tumors were 
      compared according sex using the Mann-Whitney test for Continuous variables and 
      the Fisher or Chi-square test for dichotomous variables. Survival analyses 
      according sex were conducted using the Kaplan-Meier method, the log-rank test, 
      Cox models and a propensity score. RESULTS: 694 patients were included, of whom 
      130 (18.7 %) were women. Among them, 587 (86 %) had cirrhosis, mainly compensated 
      (Child A 62.7 %), and related to alcohol (48.7 %), HCV (27.2 %), and/or 
      metabolic-associated fatty liver disease (25.8 %). HCC was unifocal in 54 % of 
      cases, with a mean main nodule size of 37 mm. Curative treatment was administered 
      in 45.4 % of cases (percutaneous ablation 93 %). Compared to men, women diagnosed 
      with HCC were older (73 vs. 65 years, p < 0.001), were more frequently 
      HCV-infected (40 % vs. 24 %, p = 0.0003) and presented more often with a solitary 
      HCC (63 % vs. 52 %, p = 0.020). After a median follow-up of 57 months, overall 
      survival was significantly longer in women both in multivariate analysis (aHR 
      1.39 (CI95 %: 1.07-1.81) p=0.014) and using a propensity score (HR 1.51 
      (1.13-2.02, p=0.005)). CONCLUSION: Despite being diagnosed at an older age, women 
      with HCC exhibit significant better overall survival.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study compared the efficacy and safety of the transarterial 
      chemoembolization with CalliSpheres(®) drug-eluting beads loading with 
      doxorubicin (DEB-TACE) versus conventional lipiodol (cTACE) in patients with 
      unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). METHODS: A randomized controlled 
      trial (RCT) was conducted with 144 patients, who were randomly assigned to 
      receive either DEB-TACE with doxorubicin-loaded CalliSpheres(®) microspheres or 
      cTACE with doxorubicin-lipiodol emulsion. Patients were followed up for 
      12 months, with assessments at 3 and 12 months posttreatment. The primary 
      endpoint was the clinical response rate (CR), and the secondary endpoints were 
      the overall survival (OS), the progression-free survival (PFS), and the safety 
      profile of the two treatments. RESULTS: The results showed that DEB-TACE was 
      superior to cTACE in terms of CR (50.0% vs 30.6% at 3 months, p = 0.03; 43.1% vs 
      25.0% at 12 months, p = 0.04), OS (18.2 months vs 14.6 months, p < 0.05), and PFS 
      (7.4 months vs 4.8 months, p < 0.05), and that the safety profile of the two 
      treatments was similar (p > 0.05 for all comparisons). However, the efficacy of 
      DEB-TACE and cTACE varied according to the tumor morphology. DEB-TACE showed 
      better CR rates in patients with nodular tumors, while no significant difference 
      in CR between the two groups in patients with infiltrative tumors. CONCLUSION: 
      DEB-TACE showed superior efficacy to cTACE in terms of CR, OS, and PFS, 
      particularly in patients with nodular tumors, while maintaining a similar safety 
      profile. These findings suggest that tumor morphology could inform treatment 
      decisions for TACE in HCC patients.

TI  - Irradiation stent with 125 I plus TACE versus sorafenib plus TACE for 
      hepatocellular carcinoma with major portal vein tumor thrombosis: a multicenter 
      randomized trial.
PG  - 1188-1198
LID - 10.1097/JS9.0000000000000295 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIM: Treatment strategy for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and Vp4 
      [main trunk] portal vein tumor thrombosis (PVTT) remains limited due to 
      posttreatment liver failure. We aimed to assess the efficacy of irradiation stent 
      placement with 125 I plus transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (TACE) 
      (ISP-TACE) compared to sorafenib plus TACE (Sora-TACE) in these patients. 
      METHODS: In this multicenter randomized controlled trial, participants with HCC 
      and Vp4 PVTT without extrahepatic metastases were enrolled from November 2018 to 
      July 2021 at 16 medical centers. The primary endpoint was overall survival (OS). 
      The secondary endpoints were hepatic function, time to symptomatic progression, 
      patency of portal vein, disease control rate, and treatment safety. RESULTS: Of 
      105 randomized participants, 51 were assigned to the ISP-TACE group, and 54 were 
      assigned to the Sora-TACE group. The median OS was 9.9 months versus 6.3 months 
      (95% CI: 0.27-0.82; P =0.01). Incidence of acute hepatic decompensation was 16% 
      (8 of 51) versus 33% (18 of 54) ( P =0.036). The time to symptomatic progression 
      was 6.6 months versus 4.2 months (95% CI: 0.38-0.93; P =0.037). The median stent 
      patency was 7.2 months (interquartile range, 4.7-9.3) in the ISP-TACE group. The 
      disease control rate was 86% (44 of 51) versus 67% (36 of 54) ( P =0.018). 
      Incidences of adverse events at least grade 3 were comparable between the safety 
      populations of the two groups: 16 of 49 (33%) versus 18 of 50 (36%) ( P =0.73). 
      CONCLUSION: Irradiation stent placement plus TACE showed superior results 
      compared with sorafenib plus TACE in prolonging OS in patients with HCC and Vp4 
      PVTT.

TI  - Adjuvant anti-PD-1 antibody for hepatocellular carcinoma with high recurrence 
      risks after hepatectomy.
PG  - 406-416
LID - 10.1007/s12072-022-10478-6 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The clinical role of postoperative adjuvant therapy in 
      hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is still unclear. The purpose of our study was to 
      explore the clinical value of postoperative adjuvant anti-programed cell death 1 
      antibody (PA-PD-1) on the prognosis of HCC patients with high relapse risks after 
      surgery. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Data of consecutive HCC patients with high 
      recurrence risks treated with liver resection at our center during January 2019 
      and March 2021 were prospectively collected. Baseline differences were balanced 
      between HCC patients with (PA-PD-1 group) or without PA-PD-1 (non-PD-1 group) 
      after hepatectomy by propensity-score matching (PSM). Between these two groups, 
      we compared overall survival (OS) and recurrence-free survival (RFS). Independent 
      prognostic risk factors for OS and RFS were confirmed by Cox regression analysis, 
      and subgroup analysis was also performed. RESULTS: 47 pairs of patients with or 
      without PD-1 treatment after hepatectomy were matched. After PSM, the 1-year and 
      2-year RFS was 58.4% and 44.1% in the PA-PD-1 group, and 34.0% and 21.3% in the 
      non-PD-1 group (p = 0.008). The OS at 1 year and 2 years was 91.2% and 91.2% in 
      the PA-PD-1 group, compared with 85.1% and 61.7% in the non-PD-1 group 
      (p = 0.024). Multivariable analyses demonstrated that PA-PD-1 was an independent 
      protective predictor associated with RFS and OS. Through subgroup analysis, we 
      concluded that HCC patients with portal venous tumor thrombus (PVTT) or tumor 
      size ≥ 5 cm significantly benefited from PA-PD-1 therapy in RFS and OS. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Adjuvant anti-PD-1 antibody can effectively improve the survival 
      outcomes of HCC patients with high relapse risks after hepatectomy in this 
      prospective observational study. This finding should be confirmed by results of 
      the ongoing phase 3 randomized controlled trials.

AB  - This study aimed to investigate whether peginterferon-α (IFN) add-on 
      nucleos(t)ide analogs(NAs) can further reduce hepatocellular carcinoma(HCC) risk 
      compared with NAs monotherapy in NA-treated patients with chronic hepatitis 
      B(CHB). In this multi-center randomized controlled trial "PARADISE study" 
      (NCT05671315), CHB patients with intermediate to high risk of HCC after more than 
      24-week NAs pretreatment were recruited, randomized to two groups at a ratio of 
      1:2 and followed up for 240 weeks. NAs group maintained NAs monotherapy, while 
      IFN + NAs group received IFN add-on NAs therapy for 48 weeks, then switched to 
      NAs monotherapy. Totally, 196 patients were included in interim analysis (NAs 
      group 68, IFN + NAs group 128). The 96-week cumulative HCC incidence was lower in 
      IFN + NAs group than NAs group (0% vs. 4.5%, p < 0.05). Compared with NAs group, 
      IFN + NAs group had significantly higher rates of HBsAg loss at week 48 and 96 
      (22.7% vs. 0%; 16.7% vs. 0%, both p < 0.05). A new scoring system was established 
      to predict HBsAg decline >2log10 IU/ml, HBsAg <10 IU/ml or HBsAg loss at the end 
      of 48-week IFN treatment. The area under ROC curve was 0.914, 0.922 or 0.905 in 
      the original cohort (n = 128) and 0.896, 0.896 or 0.864 in the external 
      validation cohort (n = 162) for the aforementioned three outcomes, respectively. 
      IFN add-on NAs therapy may suggest the dual benefits of reducing HCC development 
      and facilitating HBsAg loss among NA-treated CHB patients with intermediate to 
      high risk of HCC. The new scoring system helps to make the most of IFN treatment 
      for a higher cost-effectiveness in healthcare.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To compare the performance of [(18)F]FDG and [(18)F]FAPI-04 in PET/CT 
      evaluation for liver cancer lesions, with a further exploration of the 
      associations between PET semiquantitative data and immunohistochemical markers to 
      liver cancer. METHODS: Patients with suspected malignant liver lesions (MLL) 
      underwent [(18)F]FDG and [(18)F]FAPI-04 PET/CT scanning. Liver lesions were 
      visually classified as positive or negative based on their uptake level exceeding 
      that of adjacent normal liver tissue. SUVmax and tumor-to-background ratio (TBR) 
      were recorded for semi-quantitative analysis. Sensitivity, specificity and 
      accuracy of each tracer were determined using pathological findings as the gold 
      standard. Furthermore, immunohistochemical analysis provided the molecular 
      characteristics of all MLLs. Comprehensive analysis explored correlations between 
      these molecular markers and PET semiquantitative parameters (SUVmax andTBR) to 
      identify potential associations. RESULTS: The study enrolled 44 patients, with 39 
      confirmed cases of MLL, comprising 28 hepatocellular carcinomas (HCC) and 11 
      intrahepatic cholangiocarcinomas (ICC). For MLL detection, [(18)F]FAPI-04 and 
      [(18)F]FDG exhibited sensitivities of 84.6% (33/39) and 76.9% (30/39), 
      specificitiesy of 60% (3/5) and 100%(5/5), and accuracy of 81.8% (36/44) and 
      79.5%(35/44). Across all liver lesions, [(18)F]FAPI-04 significantly surpassed 
      [(18)F]FDG in SUVmax(10.54 ± 6.72 VS. 7.68 ± 6.79) and TBR(4.35 ± 3.78 Vs. 
      3.17 ± 3.05). Notably, [(18)F]FAPI-04 displayed markebly elevated SUVmax in 
      benign liver lesions (BLLs) (P = 0.032), HCCs (P = 0.005), and ICCs (P = 0.011). 
      Lesions with hepatocyte negativity (P = 0.023), CD34 negativity(P = 0.044), and 
      high Ki67 expression (> 30%) (P = 0.001) had higher SUVmax on [(18)F]FAPI-04. 
      Additionally, ARG-1-negative lesions demonstrated higher TBR on [(18)F]FAPI-04 
      than ARG-1-positive lesions(P = 0.018). No significant SUVmax/TBR differences 
      were observed with [(18)F]FDG based on these markers. A linear relationship was 
      identified between Ki67 scores and SUVmax of [(18)F]FAPI-04 (R = 0.603, 
      P < 0.001). CONCLUSION: [(18)F]FAPI-04 exhibits superior performance over 
      [(18)F]FDG in PET/CT evaluation of liver cancer, characterized by increased 
      sensitivity and SUVmax/TBR. Significant correlations with molecular markers, 
      including Ki67, suggest [(18)F]FAPI-04's potential for characterizing liver 
      cancer subtypes and assessing tumor proliferation. However, further research is 
      required to validate these findings and their clinical significance. TRIAL

TI  - Efficacy and outcome of molecular targeted therapies in elderly patients with 
      hepatocellular carcinoma: Relative dose intensity associated with overall 
      survival.
PG  - 22023-22037
LID - 10.1002/cam4.6783 [doi]
AB  - AIM: Indications of drug therapies to elderly patients with hepatocellular 
      carcinoma (HCC) should be carefully determined. The current study assessed the 
      safety and efficacy of molecular targeted agents (MTAs) in the elderly patients 
      with HCC, and identified factors associated with prognosis in a real-world 
      clinical setting. METHODS: In a retrospective observational study, clinical data 
      of patients with unresectable HCC treated with sorafenib or lenvatinib as 
      first-line treatment at our hospital between 2011 and 2022, were investigated. 
      Clinical parameters, therapeutic effects, adverse events (AEs), and prognosis 
      were evaluated separately for the non-elderly (<75 years old) and elderly 
      patients (≥75 years old). RESULTS: Overall, 111 patients were enrolled, including 
      59 non-elderly and 52 elderly patients. Compared to the non-elderly patients, the 
      elderly patients had significantly lower skeletal muscle mass and a significantly 
      lower percentage of patients in poor general condition with performance status 2 
      or higher, but there were no differences in parameters related to liver function 
      or nutritional status. There were no significant differences in the incidence of 
      severe AEs and therapeutic effects between the groups. No significant difference 
      in progression-free survival was observed in the elderly and non-elderly 
      patients; however, overall survival (OS) for sorafenib treatment was shorter in 
      the elderly patients than in the non-elderly patients. Elderly patients consumed 
      lower doses of both the drugs, and relative dose intensity (RDI) 4 weeks after 
      treatment (4W-RDI) was associated with OS. Further, OS in the elderly patients 
      was significantly longer in the subgroup with high 4W-RDI as compared to that in 
      the subgroup with low 4W-RDI. CONCLUSIONS: MTAs can be safely administered to 
      elderly patients with HCC. Furthermore, 4W-RDI is associated with longer OS. 
      Maintaining RDI in the early phase is crucial in predicting the success of 
      treatment with MTAs, especially in the elderly patients.

TI  - Multicenter evaluation of the safety and efficacy of selective internal radiation 
      therapy with yttrium-90 resin microspheres in Taiwan: data from the RESIN 
      registry.
PG  - 1318-1327
LID - 10.1111/jgh.16556 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIM: The REgistry of Selective Internal radiation therapy in 
      AsiaNs (RESIN) was a multicenter, single-arm, prospective, observational study of 
      (90)Y resin microspheres in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) or 
      metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) from Taiwan. RESIN is the first real-life 
      clinical study of this therapy in an Asian cohort. Study objectives were to 
      evaluate the safety and efficacy of (90)Y resin microspheres. METHODS: Adults 
      with HCC or mCRC scheduled to receive SIRT with (90)Y resin microspheres were 
      included. Primary endpoints were best overall response rate (ORR), adverse 
      events, and changes from baseline in liver function. Secondary efficacy endpoints 
      included overall survival (OS). RESULTS: Of 107 enrolled patients, 83 had HCC, 
      and 24 had mCRC. ORR was 55.41% (HCC) and 33.33% (mCRC). Of 58 HCC patients with 
      6-month post-SIRT data, 13.79% (n = 8) had resection, transplantation, 
      transarterial chemoembolization, or radiofrequency ablation as the result of 
      down-staging or down-sizing of their lesions. One hundred and ten treatment 
      emergent adverse events (TEAEs) were reported in 51 patients, and five serious 
      adverse events (SAEs) were reported in five patients. The most frequent TEAEs 
      were abdominal pain, nausea and decreased appetite (HCC), and abdominal pain, 
      decreased appetite, fatigue, and vomiting (mCRC). Two deaths due to SAEs 
      (probably related to SIRT) were reported, both in patients with extensive HCC, 
      active hepatitis infection, and other comorbidities. Median OS was 24.07 (HCC) 
      and 12.66 (mCRC) months. CONCLUSIONS: Safety and efficacy outcomes with the 
      routine use of SIRT with (90)Y resin microspheres in Taiwan are consistent with 
      published data.

AB  - Accurately predicting survival in patients with early hepatocellular carcinoma 
      (HCC) is essential for making informed decisions about treatment and prognosis. 
      Herein, we have developed a machine learning (ML) model that can predict patient 
      survival and guide treatment decisions. We obtained patient demographic 
      information, tumor characteristics, and treatment details from the SEER database. 
      To analyze the data, we employed a Cox proportional hazards (CoxPH) model as well 
      as 3 ML algorithms: neural network multitask logistic regression (N-MLTR), 
      DeepSurv, and random survival forest (RSF). Our evaluation relied on the 
      concordance index (C-index) and Integrated Brier Score (IBS). Additionally, we 
      provided personalized treatment recommendations regarding surgery and 
      chemotherapy choices and validated models' efficacy. A total of 1136 patients 
      with early-stage (I, II) hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) who underwent liver 
      resection or transplantation were randomly divided into training and validation 
      cohorts at a ratio of 3:7. Feature selection was conducted using Cox regression 
      analyses. The ML models (NMLTR: C-index = 0.6793; DeepSurv: C-index = 0.7028; 
      RSF: C-index = 0.6890) showed better discrimination in predicting survival than 
      the standard CoxPH model (C-index = 0.6696). Patients who received recommended 
      treatments had higher survival rates than those who received unrecommended 
      treatments. ML-based surgery treatment recommendations yielded higher hazard 
      ratios (HRs): NMTLR HR = 0.36 (95% CI: 0.25-0.51, P < .001), DeepSurv HR = 0.34 
      (95% CI: 0.24-0.49, P < .001), and RSF HR = 0.37 (95% CI: 0.26-0.52, P = <.001). 
      Chemotherapy treatment recommendations were associated with significantly 
      improved survival for DeepSurv (HR: 0.57; 95% CI: 0.4-0.82, P = .002) and RSF 
      (HR: 0.66; 95% CI: 0.46-0.94, P = .020). The ML survival model has the potential 
      to benefit prognostic evaluation and treatment of HCC. This novel analytical 
      approach could provide reliable information on individual survival and treatment 
      recommendations.

PG  - 4725-4737
LID - 10.3748/wjg.v30.i44.4725 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The long-term stability of hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) 
      seroclearance following peginterferon alpha (peg-IFN-α)-based therapy has not 
      been extensively studied, leaving the full potential and limitations of this 
      strategy unclear. AIM: To assess HBsAg recurrence after seroclearance achieved by 
      peg-IFN-α regimens. METHODS: This prospective, multicenter, observational study 
      was conducted from November 2015 to June 2021 at three Chinese hospitals: The 
      Second Affiliated Hospital of Xi'an Jiaotong University, Ankang Central Hospital, 
      and The Affiliated Hospital of Yan'an University. Participants who achieved HBsAg 
      seroclearance following peg-IFN-α-based treatments were monitored every 4-12 
      weeks post-treatment for hepatitis B virus (HBV) markers, HBV DNA, and liver 
      function. The primary outcome was HBV recurrence, defined as the reemergence of 
      HBsAg, HBV DNA, or both, at least twice within 4-8 weeks of follow-up. RESULTS: 
      In total, 121 patients who achieved HBsAg seroclearance were enrolled. After a 
      median follow-up of 84.0 (48.0, 132.0) weeks, four subjects were lost to 
      follow-up. HBsAg recurrence was detected in 16 patients. The cumulative HBsAg 
      recurrence rate in the intention-to-treat population was 15.2%. Multivariate 
      logistic regression analysis demonstrated that consolidation time < 12 weeks 
      [odds ratio (OR) = 28.044, 95%CI: 4.525-173.791] and hepatitis B surface antibody 
      disappearance during follow-up (OR = 46.445, 95%CI: 2.571-838.957) were strong 
      predictors of HBsAg recurrence. HBV DNA positivity and decompensation of liver 
      cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma were not observed. CONCLUSION: HBsAg 
      seroclearance following peg-IFN-α treatment was durable over 84 weeks of 
      follow-up with a cumulative recurrence rate of 15.2%.

AB  - PURPOSE: We hypothesized that optimizing the utility of stereotactic body 
      radiotherapy (SBRT) based on the individual patient's probability for tumor 
      control and risk of liver injury would decrease toxicity without sacrificing 
      local control in patients with impaired liver function or tumors not amenable to 
      thermal ablation. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients with Child-Pugh (CP) A to B7 
      liver function with aggregate tumor size >3.5 cm, or CP ≥ B8 with any size tumor 
      were prospectively enrolled on an Institutional Review Board-approved phase II 
      clinical trial to undergo SBRT with baseline and midtreatment dose optimization 
      using a quantitative, individualized utility-based analysis. Primary endpoints 
      were change in CP score of ≥2 points within 6 months and local control. 
      Protocol-treated patients were compared with patients receiving conventional SBRT 
      at another cancer center using overlap weighting. RESULTS: A total of 56 patients 
      with 80 treated tumors were analyzed with a median follow-up of 11.2 months. 
      Two-year cumulative incidence of local progression was 6.4% [95% confidence 
      interval (CI, 2.4-13.4)]. Twenty-one percent of patients experienced 
      treatment-related toxicity within 6 months, which is similar to the rate for SBRT 
      in patients with CP A liver function. An analysis using overlap weighting 
      revealed similar local control [HR, 0.69; 95% CI (0.25-1.91); P = 0.48] and 
      decreased toxicity [OR, 0.26; 95% CI (0.07-0.99); P = 0.048] compared with 
      conventional SBRT. CONCLUSIONS: Treatment of individuals with impaired liver 
      function or tumors not amenable to thermal ablation with a treatment paradigm 
      designed to optimize utility may decrease treatment-related toxicity while 
      maintaining tumor control.

AB  - Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) usually recurs after curative surgical resection. 
      Currently, no approved adjuvant therapy has been shown to reduce HCC recurrence 
      rates. In this study, the in vivo effect of sequential combination treatment with 
      recombinant mouse interferon-alpha (rmIFN-α) and an anti-mouse-PD1 antibody on 
      hepatitis B virus (HBV) clearance in mice was evaluated. A Phase I clinical trial 
      was then conducted to assess the safety, tolerability, and inhibitory activity of 
      sequential therapy with ropeginterferon alfa-2b and nivolumab in patients with 
      HCC recurrence who underwent curative surgery for HBV-related HCC. The animal 
      modeling study showed that HBV suppression was significantly greater with the 
      rmIFN-α and anti-PD1 sequential combination treatment in comparison with sole 
      treatment with rmIFN-α or anti-PD1. In the Phase I study, eleven patients 
      completed the sequential therapy with ropeginterferon alfa-2b every two weeks for 
      six doses at 450 µg, followed by three doses of nivolumab every two weeks up to 
      0.75 mg/kg. A notable decrease in or clearance of HBV surface antigen was 
      observed in two patients. The dose-limiting toxicity of grade 3 alanine 
      transaminase and aspartate aminotransferase increases was observed in one 
      patient. The maximum tolerated dose was then determined. To date, no HCC 
      recurrence has been observed. The treatment modality was well tolerated. These 
      data support the further clinical development of sequential combination therapy 
      as a post-surgery prophylactic measure against the recurrence of HBV-related HCC.

TI  - The effect of switch therapy to tenofovir versus entecavir maintenance on 
      recurrence of hepatocellular carcinoma after surgery (SWITE): study protocol for 
      a randomized controlled trial.
PG  - 781
LID - 10.1186/s13063-023-07822-y [doi]
LID - 781
AB  - BACKGROUND: Antiviral therapy has been reported to be associated with lower 
      recurrence rate of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) for patients with hepatitis B 
      virus (HBV) infection. While entecavir (ETV) and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate 
      (TDF) were both recommended as first-line therapies for HBV patients, recent 
      retrospective studies proposed a lower incidence rate of HCC occurrence or 
      recurrence in those receiving TDF compared ETV. However, the survival benefits of 
      switching to TDF therapy after prolonged ETV treatment before surgery remain 
      uncertain. We delineate the rationale and design of SWITE, a randomized, 
      open-label, phase III trial contrasting TDF switch therapy versus ETV maintenance 
      in HBV-related HCC patients. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: This is a prospective, 
      randomized, controlled, single-center study with two parallel groups of patients 
      with HBV-related HCC who have received long-term ETV therapy before surgery. West 
      China Hospital will enroll 238 patients, randomized in a 1:1 ratio to TDF switch 
      therapy or ETV maintenance after surgery. The primary endpoint of this study is 
      3-year recurrence free survival (RFS), with the secondary endpoint being 3-year 
      overall survival (OS) after curative surgery of HCC. Safety events will be 
      diligently recorded. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The study protocol aligns with the 
      ethical guidelines of the 1975 Declaration of Helsinki. It was approved by ethics 
      committee of West China Hospital (approval number: 2022-074) and was registered 
      with chictr.org.cn (chiCTR2200057867). Informed consent will be obtained from all 
      participants. The results of this trial will be published in peer-reviewed 
      journals and presentations at national and international conferences relevant to 
      this topic. TRIAL REGISTRATION: chiCTR2200057867 . Date of registration is March 
      20 2022.

AB  - SAR439459 (SAR'459), a "second-generation" human anti-transforming growth factor 
      beta (TGFβ) monoclonal antibody, enhances the activity of immune checkpoint 
      inhibitors. In this phase I/Ib study, we evaluated the safety, pharmacokinetics 
      (PK), pharmacodynamics, and antitumor activity of SAR'459 ± cemiplimab 
      (intravenous) in patients with advanced solid tumors. Increasing doses of SAR'459 
      were administered every 2 or 3 weeks (Q2W, Q3W) alone (Part 1A) or with 3 mg/kg 
      cemiplimab Q2W or 350 mg Q3W (Part 1B). In Part 2A (dose expansion), melanoma 
      patients were randomly (1:1) administered 22.5 or 7.5 mg/kg SAR'459. In Part 2B 
      (dose expansion), 22.5 mg/kg SAR'459 and 350 mg cemiplimab Q3W were administered. 
      The primary end points were maximum tolerated dose (MTD) or maximum administered 
      dose (MAD; Part 1), preliminary antitumor activity (Part 2B), and optimal 
      monotherapy dose (Part 2A). Twenty-eight and 24 patients were treated in Parts 1A 
      and 1B, respectively; MTD was not reached, MAD was 15 (Q2W) and 22.5 mg/kg (Q3W) 
      alone and in combination, respectively. Fourteen and 95 patients, including 14 
      hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients, were treated in Parts 2A and 2B, 
      respectively. The population PK model yielded satisfactory goodness-of-fit plots 
      and adequately described the observed data by a two-compartment PK model with 
      linear elimination. Objective responses were not observed in Parts 1 and 2A. In 
      Part 2B, objective response rate was 8.4% and 7.1% across tumor types and the HCC 
      cohort, respectively. The most frequent treatment-emergent adverse effects were 
      hemorrhagic events (43.5%), keratoacanthoma (6.8%), and skin neoplasms (6.2%). 
      Fatal bleeding occurred in 21.4% HCC patients despite the implementation of 
      mitigation measures. SAR'459 monotherapy and combination with cemiplimab appeared 
      relatively safe and tolerable in limited number of patients in dose escalation. 
      However, the study was discontinued due to the unclear efficacy of SAR'459 and 
      bleeding risk, particularly in HCC patients.

LID - 10.1158/2767-9764.CRC-22-0516 [doi]
AB  - Sorafenib blocks nonstructural protein 5A (NS5A)-recruited c-Raf-mediated 
      hepatitis C virus (HCV) replication and gene expression. Release of Raf-1-Ask-1 
      dimer and inhibition of Raf-1 via sorafenib putatively differ in the presence or 
      absence of doxorubicin. Cancer and Leukemia Group B (CALGB) 80802 (Alliance) 
      randomized phase III trial of doxorubicin plus sorafenib versus sorafenib in 
      patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), showed no improvement in 
      median overall survival (OS). Whether HCV viral load impacts therapy and whether 
      any correlation between HCV titers and outcome based on HCV was studied. In 
      patients with HCV, HCV titer levels were evaluated at baseline and at multiple 
      postbaseline timepoints until disease progression or treatment discontinuation. 
      HCV titer levels were evaluated in relation to OS and progression-free survival 
      (PFS). Among 53 patients with baseline HCV data, 12 patients had undetectable HCV 
      (HCV-UN). Postbaseline HCV titer levels did not significantly differ between 
      treatment arms. One patient in each arm went from detectable to HCV-UN with 
      greater than 2 log-fold titer levels reduction. Aside from these 2 HCV-UN 
      patients, HCV titers remained stable on treatment. Patients who had HCV-UN at 
      baseline were 3.5 times more likely to progress and/or die from HCC compared with 
      HCV detectable (HR = 3.51; 95% confidence interval: 1.58-7.78; P = 0.002). HCV 
      titer levels remained unchanged, negating any sorafenib impact onto HCV titer 
      levels. Although an overall negative phase III study, patients treated with 
      doxorubicin plus sorafenib and sorafenib only, on CALGB 80802 had worse PFS if 
      HCV-UN. Higher levels of HCV titers at baseline were associated with 
      significantly improved PFS. SIGNIFICANCE: Sorafenib therapy for HCC may impact 
      HCV replication and viral gene expression. In HCV-positive patients accrued to 
      CLAGB 80802 phase III study evaluating the addition of doxorubicin to sorafenib, 
      HCV titer levels were evaluated at baseline and different timepoints. Sorafenib 
      did not impact HCV titer levels. Despite an improved PFS in patients with 
      detectable higher level HCV titers at baseline, no difference in OS was noted.

TI  - Preoperative dexamethasone administration in hepatectomy of 25-min intermittent 
      Pringle's maneuver for hepatocellular carcinoma: a randomized controlled trial.
PG  - 3354-3364
LID - 10.1097/JS9.0000000000000622 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: A previous randomized controlled trial demonstrated that intermittent 
      Pringle's maneuver (IPM) with a 25-min ischemic interval could be applied safely 
      and efficiently in hepatectomy for patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). 
      But prolonging the hepatic inflow clamping time will inevitably aggravate the 
      ischemia-reperfusion injury. Therefore, we aimed to evaluate the effect of 
      prophylactic dexamethasone on alleviating surgical stress for HCC patients with a 
      25-min ischemic interval. METHODS: From December 2022 to April 2023, patients who 
      met the inclusion criteria were randomly assigned to the dexamethasone group or 
      control group. Perioperative data and short-term survival outcomes between the 
      two groups were recorded and compared, and subgroup analysis was performed. 
      RESULTS: Two hundred and seventy patients were allocated to the dexamethasone 
      group ( n =135) and control group ( n =135). Patients in the dexamethasone group 
      had lower area under the curve of serial alanine aminotransferase (AUC ALT ) ( P 
      =0.043) and aspartate aminotransferase (AUC AST ) ( P =0.009), total bilirubin 
      (TB) ( P =0.018), procalcitonin (PCT) ( P =0.012), interleukin-6 (IL-6) ( P 
      =0.006), incidence of major complication ( P =0.031) and shorter postoperative 
      hospital stay ( P =0.046) than those in the control group. Subgroup analysis 
      showed that the dexamethasone group experienced milder hepatocellular injury than 
      the control group for patients with cirrhosis, and for patients without 
      cirrhosis, the dexamethasone group experienced milder inflammatory response. 
      Moreover, the dexamethasone group preserved better liver function and experienced 
      milder inflammatory response for patients undergoing major hepatectomy, although 
      the hepatocellular injury was not significantly improved. CONCLUSION: 
      Preoperative dexamethasone administration can help improve perioperative outcomes 
      for HCC patients when applying IPM with a 25-min ischemic interval in 
      hepatectomy.

TI  - Radiotherapy is superior to transarterial chemoembolization as adjuvant therapy 
      after narrow-margin hepatectomy in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma: A 
      single-center prospective randomized study.
PG  - 97
LID - 10.1007/s00423-024-03249-4 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: This study was recruited to compare the efficacy and safety of 
      radiotherapy (RT) and transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) as postoperative 
      adjuvant therapy after narrow-margin hepatectomy in hepatocellular carcinoma 
      (HCC) patients. METHODS: This single-center prospective randomized study was 
      conducted in the Cancer Hospital, Guang Xi Medical University, Nanning. A total 
      of 72 patients who received treatment in this hospital between August 2017 and 
      July 2019 were included and randomly allocated to TACE group (n = 48) and RT 
      group (n = 24). Next, overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) 
      rates, recurrence patterns, financial burden, and safety were evaluated. RESULTS: 
      The difference between the RT and TACE groups was not significant in one-, 
      three-, and five-year OS (87.5%, 79.0%, and 62.5% vs. 93.8%, 75.9%, and 63.4%, 
      respectively, P = 0.071) and PFS rates (79.0%, 54.2%, and 22.6% vs. 75.0%, 47.9%, 
      and 32.6%, respectively, P = 0.071). Compared to the TACE group, the RT group had 
      significantly lower intrahepatic recurrence rate (20.8% vs. 52.1%, P = 0.011), 
      higher extrahepatic recurrence rate (37.5% vs. 14.6%, P = 0.034), and no marginal 
      and diffuse recurrences (0% vs. 16.7%, P < 0.05). The mean overall treatment cost 
      was higher (¥62,550.59 ± 4397.27 vs. ¥40,732.56 ± 9210.54, P < 0.01), the 
      hospital stay (15.1 ± 3.7 vs. 11.8 ± 4.1 days, P < 0.01) was longer, and the 
      overall treatment stay (13.3 ± 5.3 vs. 41.29 ± 12.4 days, P < 0.01) was shorter 
      in the TACE group than in the RT group. Besides, both groups did not exhibit 
      significant differences in the frequency and severity of adverse events. 
      CONCLUSION: Both adjuvant TACE and RT can better the OS and PFS of patients with 
      HCC. However, RT has a significantly better performance than TACE in terms of 
      improving intrahepatic recurrence rate, treatment cost and hospital stay.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Cirrhosis, the end result of liver injury, has high mortality 
      globally. The effect of country-level income on mortality from cirrhosis is 
      unclear. We aimed to assess predictors of death in inpatients with cirrhosis 
      using a global consortium focusing on cirrhosis-related and access-related 
      variables. METHODS: In this prospective observational cohort study, the CLEARED 
      Consortium followed up inpatients with cirrhosis at 90 tertiary care hospitals in 
      25 countries across six continents. Consecutive patients older than 18 years who 
      were admitted non-electively, without COVID-19 or advanced hepatocellular 
      carcinoma, were enrolled. We ensured equitable participation by limiting 
      enrolment to a maximum of 50 patients per site. Data were collected from patients 
      and their medical records, and included demographic characteristics; country; 
      disease severity (MELD-Na score); cirrhosis cause; medications used; reasons for 
      admission; transplantation listing; cirrhosis-related history in the past 6 
      months; and clinical course and management while hospitalised and for 30 days 
      post discharge. Primary outcomes were death and receipt of liver transplant 
      during index hospitalisation or within 30 days post discharge. Sites were 
      surveyed regarding availability of and access to diagnostic and treatment 
      services. Outcomes were compared by country income level of participating sites, 
      defined according to World Bank income classifications (high-income countries 
      [HICs], upper-middle-income countries [UMICs], and low-income or 
      lower-middle-income countries [LICs or LMICs]). Multivariable models controlling 
      for demographic variables, disease cause, and disease severity were used to 
      analyse the odds of each outcome associated with variables of interest. FINDINGS: 
      Patients were recruited between Nov 5, 2021, and Aug 31, 2022. Complete inpatient 
      data were obtained for 3884 patients (mean age 55·9 years [SD 13·3]; 2493 (64·2%) 
      men and 1391 (35·8%) women; 1413 [36·4%] from HICs, 1757 [45·2%] from UMICs, and 
      714 [18·4%] from LICs or LMICs), with 410 lost to follow-up within 30 days after 
      hospital discharge. The number of patients who died while hospitalised was 110 
      (7·8%) of 1413 in HICs, 182 (10·4%) of 1757 in UMICs, and 158 (22·1%) of 714 in 
      LICs and LMICs (p<0·0001), and within 30 days post discharge these values were 
      179 (14·4%) of 1244 in HICs, 267 (17·2%) of 1556 in UMICs, and 204 (30·3%) of 674 
      in LICs and LMICs (p<0·0001). Compared with patients from HICs, increased risk of 
      death during hospitalisation was found for patients from UMICs (adjusted odds 
      ratio [aOR] 2·14 [95% CI 1·61-2·84]) and from LICs or LMICs (2·54 [1·82-3·54]), 
      in addition to increased risk of death within 30 days post discharge (1·95 
      [1·44-2·65] in UMICs and 1·84 [1·24-2·72] in LICs or LMICs). Receipt of a liver 
      transplant was recorded in 59 (4·2%) of 1413 patients from HICs, 28 (1·6%) of 
      1757 from UMICs (aOR 0·41 [95% CI 0·24-0·69] vs HICs), and 14 (2·0%) of 714 from 
      LICs and LMICs (0·21 [0·10-0·41] vs HICs) during index hospitalisation 
      (p<0·0001), and in 105 (9·2%) of 1137 patients from HICs, 55 (4·0%) of 1372 from 
      UMICs (0·58 [0·39-0·85] vs HICs), and 16 (3·1%) of 509 from LICs or LMICs (0·21 
      [0·11-0·40] vs HICs) by 30 days post discharge (p<0·0001). Site survey results 
      showed that access to important medications (rifaximin, albumin, and 
      terlipressin) and interventions (emergency endoscopy, liver transplantation, 
      intensive care, and palliative care) varied geographically. INTERPRETATION: 
      Inpatients with cirrhosis in LICs, LMICs, or UMICs have significantly higher 
      mortality than inpatients in HICs independent of medical risk factors, and this 
      might be due to disparities in access to essential diagnostic and treatment 
      services. These results should encourage researchers and policy makers to 
      consider access to services and medications when evaluating cirrhosis-related 
      outcomes. FUNDING: National Institutes of Health and US Department of Veterans 
      Affairs.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to establish a model for predicting the 
      prognosis of patients with microvascular invasion (MVI)-negative hepatocellular 
      carcinoma (HCC) based on qualitative and quantitative analyses of Gd-EOB-DTPA 
      magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Consecutive patients 
      with MVI-negative HCC who underwent preoperative Gd-EOB-DTPA MRI between January 
      2015 and December 2019 were retrospectively enrolled.In total, 122 patients were 
      randomly assigned to the training and validation groups at a ratio of 7:3. 
      Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were performed to 
      identify significant clinical parameters and MRI features, including quantitative 
      and qualitative parameters associated with prognosis, which were incorporated 
      into a predictive nomogram. The end-point of this study was recurrence-free 
      survival. Outcomes were compared between groups using the Kaplan-Meier method 
      with the log-rank test. RESULTS: During a median follow-up period of 
      58.86 months, 38 patients (31.15 %) experienced recurrence. Multivariate analysis 
      revealed that lower relative enhancement ratio (RER), hepatobiliary phase 
      hypointensity without arterial phase hyperenhancement, Liver Imaging Reporting 
      and Data System category, mild-moderate T2 hyperintensity, and higher aspartate 
      aminotransferase levels were risk factors associated with prognosis and then 
      incorporated into the prognostic model. C-indices for training and validation 
      groups were 0.732 and 0.692, respectively. The most appropriate cut-off value for 
      RER was 1.197. Patients with RER ≤ 1.197 had significantly higher postoperative 
      recurrence rates than those with RER > 1.197 (p = 0.004). CONCLUSION: The model 
      integrating qualitative and quantitative imaging parameters and clinical 
      parameters satisfactorily predicted the prognosis of patients with MVI-negative 
      HCC.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Malnutrition is the most common complication in postoperative liver 
      cancer patients. This study aimed to investigate the effects of the Home to 
      Hospital to Home nutrition management program on postoperative liver cancer 
      patients. METHODS: A total of 184 liver cancer patients were randomly assigned to 
      either an intervention group (treated under the Home to Hospital to Home 
      nutrition management program) or a control group (treated with the general 
      nutritional method). Nutrition-related indicators, such as prealbumin (PA) and 
      albumin, were assessed before and after treatment in both groups. The incidence 
      of complications (e.g., nausea or vomiting, bloating, difficulty defecating, 
      ascites), length of hospital stay, first time to anal exhaust and out-of-bed 
      activity, and patient satisfaction were recorded. RESULTS: A total of 184 liver 
      cancer patients were randomly assigned to either an intervention group (treated 
      under the Home to Hospital to Home nutrition management program) or a control 
      group (treated with the general nutritional method). Nutrition-related 
      indicators, such as prealbumin (PA) and albumin, were assessed before and after 
      treatment in both groups. The incidence of complications (e.g., nausea or 
      vomiting, bloating, difficulty defecating, ascites), length of hospital stay, 
      first time to anal exhaust and out-of-bed activity, and patient satisfaction were 
      recorded. CONCLUSION: The Home to Hospital to Home nutrition management program 
      improves the nutritional status of postoperative liver cancer patients, lowers 
      the incidence of complications, shortens hospital stays, increases patient 
      satisfaction, and promotes the early recovery of patients.

AB  - The treatment efficiency and predictors of atezolizumab plus bevacizumab therapy 
      for unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma in real-world practice have not been 
      established. This study aimed to assess the efficacy and safety of atezolizumab 
      plus bevacizumab and to investigate predictors of progression-free survival and 
      overall survival. Patients with unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma treated 
      with atezolizumab plus bevacizumab therapy in 19 hospitals were enrolled before 
      treatment and observed prospectively. The outcomes of 222 patients in this cohort 
      were analyzed. The objective response rate and disease control rate were 22.0% 
      and 70.6%, respectively, whereas the median progression-free survival was 5.7 
      months. Independent risk factors for shortened progression-free survival were 
      younger age (<75 years; 3.9 months vs. 8.6 months), higher number of intrahepatic 
      tumors (≥5; 4.0 months vs. 7.9 months), macrovascular invasion (2.3 months vs. 
      6.7 months), and higher neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (≥3.03; 3.0 months vs. 7.8 
      months). The median overall survival was not reached; however, independent risk 
      factors for shortened overall survival were absence of hyperlipidemia, higher 
      number of intrahepatic tumors (≥5), macrovascular invasion, higher α-fetoprotein 
      level (≥400 ng/mL), worse Child-Pugh score (≥6), and higher 
      neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (≥3.03). Severe adverse events (grade ≥3) were 
      observed in 96 patients (36.0%), with proteinuria being the most frequent. In 
      conclusion, patients with older age, lower number of intrahepatic tumors, absent 
      macrovascular invasion, and lower neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio are expected to 
      have better progression-free survival with atezolizumab plus bevacizumab therapy 
      for unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma.

TI  - Neoadjuvant therapy of sequential TACE, camrelizumab, and apatinib for single 
      huge hepatocellular carcinoma (NEO-START): study protocol for a randomized 
      controlled trial.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The high recurrence rate after liver resection emphasizes the urgent 
      need for neoadjuvant therapy in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) to enhance the 
      overall prognosis for patients. Immune checkpoint inhibitors, camrelizumab 
      combined with an anti-angiogenic tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) apatinib, have 
      emerged as a first-line treatment option for patients with unresectable HCC, yet 
      its neoadjuvant application in combination with transarterial chemoembolization 
      (TACE) in HCC remains unexplored. Therefore, this study aims to investigate the 
      efficacy and safety of sequential TACE, camrelizumab, and apatinib as a 
      neoadjuvant therapy for single, huge HCC. METHODS: This multi-center, open-label 
      randomized phase 3 trial will be conducted at 7 tertiary hospitals. Patients with 
      single huge (≥ 10 cm in diameter), resectable HCC will be randomly assigned in a 
      1:1 ratio to arm of surgery alone or arm of neoadjuvant therapy followed by 
      surgery. In the neoadjuvant therapy group, patients will receive TACE within 1 
      week after randomization, followed by camrelizumab (200 mg q2w, 4 cycles), along 
      with apatinib (250 mg qd, 2 months). Patients will receive liver resection after 
      neoadjuvant therapy unless the disease is assessed as progressive. The primary 
      outcome is recurrence-free survival (RFS) at 1 year. The planned sample size of 
      60 patients will be calculated to permit the accumulation of sufficient RFS 
      events in 1 year to achieve 80% power for the RFS primary endpoint. DISCUSSION: 
      Synergistic effects provided by multimodality therapy of locoregional treatment, 
      TKI, and anti-programmed cell death 1 inhibitor significantly improved overall 
      survival for patients with unresectable HCC. Our trial will investigate the 
      efficacy and safety of the triple combination of TACE, camrelizumab, and apatinib 
      as a neoadjuvant strategy for huge, resectable HCC. TRIAL REGISTRATION: 
      www.chitr.org.cn ChiCTR2300078086. Registered on November 28, 2023. Start 
      recruitment: 1st January 2024. Expected completion of recruitment: 15th June 
      2025.

AB  - PURPOSE: To compare transarterial chemoembolization delivered with drug eluting 
      beads (TACE-DEB) with stereotactioc body radiation therapy (SBRT) in patients 
      with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in a multicenter randomized trial. METHODS 
      AND MATERIALS: Patients were included if they were eligible for TACE. They could 
      also be recruited if they required treatment prior to liver transplantation. A 
      maximum of four TACE-DEB procedures and ablation after incomplete TACE-DEB were 
      both allowed. SBRT was delivered in six fractions of 8-9Gy. Primary end point was 
      time to progression (TTP). Secondary endpoints were local control (LC), overall 
      survival (OS), response rate (RR), toxicity, and quality of life (QoL). The 
      calculated sample size was 100 patients. RESULTS: Between May 2015 and April 
      2020, 30 patients were randomized to the study. Due to slow accrual the trial was 
      closed prematurely. Two patients in the SBRT arm were considered ineligible 
      leaving 16 patients in the TACE-DEB arm and 12 in the SBRT arm. Median follow-up 
      was 28.1 months. Median TTP was 12 months for TACEDEB and 19 months for SBRT 
      (p=0.15). Median LC was 12 months for TACE-DEB and >40 months (not reached) for 
      SBRT (p=0.075). Median OS was 36.8 months for TACEDEB and 44.1 months for SBRT 
      (p=0.36). A post-hoc analysis showed 100% for SBRT 1- and 2-year LC, and 54.4% 
      and 43.6% for TACE-DEB (p=0.019). Both treatments resulted in RR>80%. Three 
      episodes of possibly related toxicity grade ≥3 were observed after TACE-DEB. No 
      episodes were observed after SBRT. QoL remained stable after both treatment arms. 
      CONCLUSIONS: In this trial, TTP after TACE-DEB was not significantly improved by 
      SBRT, while SBRT showed higher local antitumoral activity than TACE-DEB, without 
      detrimental effects on OS, toxicity and QoL. To overcome poor accrual in 
      randomized trials that include SBRT, and to generate evidence for including SBRT 
      in treatment guidelines, international cooperation is needed.

TI  - Partial hepatectomy versus interventional treatment in patients with hepatitis B 
      virus-related hepatocellular carcinoma and clinically significant portal 
      hypertension: a randomized comparative clinical trial.
PG  - 1337-1349
LID - 10.1002/cac2.12614 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The widely accepted view that portal hypertension (PHT) is a 
      contraindication to hepatectomy for patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) 
      is being increasingly challenged. The long-term survival outcomes and safety of 
      partial hepatectomy versus interventional treatment using ablation with or 
      without pre-ablation transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) in patients with 
      HBV-related HCC within the Milan criteria and with clinically significant PHT 
      were compared in this study. METHODS: This open-label randomized clinical trial 
      was conducted on consecutive patients with clinically PHT and hepatitis B virus 
      (HBV)-related HCC with tumors which were within the Milan criteria. These 
      patients were randomized 1:1 to receive either partial hepatectomy or 
      interventional treatment between December 2012 and June 2018. The primary 
      endpoint was overall survival (OS); secondary endpoints included recurrence-free 
      survival (RFS) and therapeutic safety. RESULTS: Each of the 2 groups had 80 
      patients. The 1-, 3- and 5-year OS rates in the partial hepatectomy group and the 
      interventional treatment group were 95.0%, 86.2%, 69.5% versus 93.8%, 77.5%, 
      64.9%, respectively (P = 0.325). The corresponding RFS rates were 78.8%, 55.0%, 
      46.2% versus 71.3%, 52.5%, 45.0%, respectively (P = 0.783). The partial 
      hepatectomy group had a higher complication rate compared to the interventional 
      group (67.5% vs. 20%, P < 0.001). However, the differences were mainly in 
      Clavien-Dindo Grade I complications (P < 0.001), while not significant in Grade 
      II/III/IV/V (All P > 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: This study shows that partial 
      hepatectomy treatment did not meet prespecified significance for improved OS and 
      RFS compared to interventional treatment for patients with HBV-related HCC within 
      the Milan criteria and with clinically significant PHT. However, partial 
      hepatectomy is still a safe procedure and should be considered as a treatment 
      option rather than a contraindication.

TI  - Preventing viral relapse with prophylactic tenofovir in hepatitis B carriers 
      receiving chemotherapy: a phase IV randomized study in Taiwan.
PG  - 449-460
LID - 10.1007/s12072-023-10635-5 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: This study aimed to compare the efficacy of shorter vs. 
      longer tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) prophylaxis in preventing hepatitis B 
      virus (HBV) relapse in cancer patients with chronic hepatitis B (CHB) undergoing 
      chemotherapy. METHODS: This phase IV, prospective randomized trial enrolled 
      cancer patients with CHB from 2014 to 2019 in Taiwan. Included patients were 
      randomized to receive either 24- (Arm A) or 48-week (Arm B) post-chemotherapy TDF 
      and compared for cumulative incidence of virological and clinical relapse. 
      Logistic regressions were conducted to determine the factors associated with HBV 
      relapse. RESULTS: One hundred patients were randomized, and 41 patients in Arm A 
      and 46 in Arm B completed the TDF treatment. No significant difference was found 
      in cumulative incidence of virological relapse (Arm A: 94.4%, Arm B: 93.1%, 
      p = 0.110) or clinical relapse among patients with baseline HBV DNA > 2000 IU/mL 
      (Arm A: 38.9%, Arm B: 26.7%, p = 0.420) between the two arms. High baseline HBV 
      DNA ≥ 10,000 IU/mL (OR = 51.22) and HBsAg ≥ 1000 IU/mL (OR = 8.64) were 
      independently associated with an increased virological relapse. Alanine 
      aminotransferase (ALT), serum phosphorus, vitamin D, and estimated glomerular 
      filtration rate (eGFR) remained stable throughout the study. CONCLUSIONS: The 
      24-week preventative TDF has comparable efficacy to the 48-week treatment in 
      virologic and clinical relapse. High baseline HBsAg or HBV DNA is associated with 
      a higher risk of HBV relapse. These findings imply a 24-week duration of TDF 
      treatment with a close monitor for patients with a high baseline viral load. 
      Hepatitis B virus infection is a prominent cause of liver cancer and chronic 
      liver disease and affected millions of people worldwide. When HBV-infected people 
      are exposed to immunosuppressive medication or chemotherapy for cancer, the 
      chance of HBV reactivation rises considerably. This trial showed 24-week 
      tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) may be sufficient for preventing HBV relapse 
      in cancer patients receiving chemotherapy. CLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: 
      NCT02081469.

TI  - Toripalimab Plus Bevacizumab as First-line Treatment for Advanced Hepatocellular 
      Carcinoma: A Prospective, Multicenter, Single-Arm, Phase II Trial.
PG  - 2937-2944
LID - 10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-24-0006 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: This phase II, multicenter, prospective, single-arm study aimed to 
      evaluate the efficacy and safety of toripalimab plus bevacizumab for treating 
      advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). PATIENTS AND METHODS: Treatment-naïve 
      patients with advanced HCC received toripalimab 240 mg plus bevacizumab 15 mg/kg 
      every 3 weeks. The primary endpoints included safety and tolerability and 
      objective response rate (ORR) assessed by the investigator per Response 
      Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) version 1.1. RESULTS: Fifty-four 
      patients were enrolled between April 17, 2020, and December 11, 2020. As assessed 
      by the investigator according to RECIST v1.1, the ORR was 31.5% [95% confidence 
      interval (CI), 19.5-45.6] and the lower bound of the 95% CI was above the 
      prespecified boundary of 10%. The independent review committee (IRC) assessed ORR 
      according to the modified RECIST (mRECIST), which was 46.3% (95% CI, 32.6-60.4). 
      The median progression-free survival was 8.5 (95% CI, 5.5-11.0) and 9.8 months 
      (95% CI, 5.6 to not evaluable) as assessed by the investigator according to 
      RECIST v1.1 and IRC according to mRECIST criteria, respectively. The median 
      overall survival (OS) was not reached, and the 12- and 24-month OS rates were 
      77.3% and 63.5%, respectively. Grade 3 or higher treatment-emergent adverse 
      events (TEAEs) occurred in 27 patients (50.0%). The most common TEAEs were 
      proteinuria (59.3%), hypertension (38.9%), increased aspartate aminotransferase 
      (33.3%), increased amylase (29.6%), decreased platelet count (27.8%), and 
      increased bilirubin levels (27.8%). CONCLUSIONS: Toripalimab plus bevacizumab 
      showed a favorable efficacy and safety profile, supporting further studies on 
      this combination regimen as a first-line treatment for advanced HCC.

TI  - Neoadjuvant intensity modulated radiotherapy for a single and small (≤5 cm) 
      hepatitis B virus-related hepatocellular carcinoma predicted to have high risks 
      of microvascular invasion: a randomized clinical trial.
PG  - 3052-3060
LID - 10.1097/JS9.0000000000000574 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The presence of microvascular invasion (MVI) significantly impairs 
      postoperative long-term survival of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). 
      The role of neoadjuvant radiotherapy (RT) in treating patients with an 
      early-stage HCC predicted to have high risks of MVI remains to be explored. 
      MATERIALS AND METHODS: Consecutive patients with a resectable single and small 
      (≤5 cm) hepatitis B virus-related HCC predicted to have high risks of MVI were 
      randomized 1:1 to receive either neoadjuvant intensity modulated radiation 
      therapy (18 Gy with fractionated doses of 3 Gy) followed by surgery 4 weeks later 
      or upfront surgery. The primary endpoint was disease-free survival (DFS). The 
      secondary outcomes included overall survival (OS), objective response rate, 
      RT-related toxicity and surgical complications. RESULTS: There were 30 patients 
      randomized to each of the two groups. In the neoadjuvant RT group, three patients 
      violated the study protocol, with two having upfront hepatectomy and one 
      radiofrequency ablation after RT. The objective response rate after RT was 25.0% 
      (7/28), but 2 patients suffered from grade 3 liver toxicity. The median follow-up 
      was 68 months (interquartile range, 58-70 months) in the neoadjuvant RT group, 
      and 68 months (interquartile range, 62-75 months) in the upfront surgery group. 
      On intention-to-treat analysis, the median DFS and median OS were not reached in 
      both the 2 arms. The 1-year, 2-year, 3-year and 5-year DFS rates for the 
      neoadjuvant RT group were 86.7%, 76.7%, 60.0% and 56.3%, versus 90.0%, 66.7%, 
      52.8% and 45.7% in the upfront surgery group ( P =0.448), respectively. The 
      corresponding OS rates were 96.7%, 86.7%, 83.3% and 72.7%, versus 100.0%, 93.3%, 
      79.6% and 60.7% ( P = 0.399). CONCLUSION AND RELEVANCE: For patients with a 
      resectable single and small hepatitis B virus-related HCC predicted to have high 
      risks of MVI, neoadjuvant RT gave a promising response rate with a mild toxicity. 
      Nevertheless, the neoadjuvant RT yielded similar long-term DFS and OS rates 
      compared with patients who underwent upfront surgery.

TI  - Chinese herbal formula ruangan granule enhances the efficacy of entecavir to 
      reverse advanced liver fibrosis/early cirrhosis in patients with chronic HBV 
      infection: A multicenter, randomized clinical trial.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Nucleotide analogs treatment can reverse liver fibrosis in chronic 
      hepatitis B (CHB). However, it has limited effect on fibrosis resolution in 
      patients with CHB, particularly in preventing progression to hepatocellular 
      carcinoma (HCC). Ruangan granule (RG), a Chinese herbal formula, has proven to 
      produce a therapeutic effect against liver fibrosis in animal experiment. Thus, 
      we aimed to evaluate the effect of our Chinese herbal formula (RG) combined with 
      entecavir (ETV) to reverse advanced liver fibrosis/early cirrhosis from CHB. 
      METHODS: A total of 240 CHB patients with histologically confirmed advanced liver 
      fibrosis/early cirrhosis from 12 centers were randomly and blindly allocated to 
      consume either ETV (0.5 mg/day) plus RG (2 times/day) or control (ETV) for 48 
      weeks (wk) treatment. Changes in histopathology, serology and imageology were 
      observed. Liver fibrosis reversion, defined as a reduction in the Knodell HAI 
      score by ≥ 2 points and Ishak score by ≥ 1 grade, was assessed. RESULTS: The rate 
      of fibrosis regression and inflammation remission after 48 wk of treatment in 
      histopathology was significantly higher in the ETV + RG group (38.73% vs. 23.94%, 
      P = 0.031). The ultrasonic semiquantitative scores decreased by ≥ 2 points and 
      were 41 (28.87%) and 15 (21.13%) in the ETV+RG and ETV groups, respectively 
      (P = 0.026). The ETV+RG group had a significantly lower Fibrosis-4 score (FIB-4) 
      index (P = 0.028). There was a significant difference between the ETV+RG and ETV 
      groups in the liver function normalization rate (P < 0.01). Moreover, ETV plus RG 
      combination treatment further reduced the risk of HCC in median 55-month 
      follow-up (P < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: This study illustrates that the Chinese herbal 
      formula RG with ETV can improve advanced liver fibrosis/early cirrhosis 
      regression in patients with CHB, further reducing the risk of HCC.

AB  - PURPOSE: The objective of this study was to develop and validate a novel 
      prognostic nomogram to evaluate the survival benefit of hepatocellular carcinoma 
      (HCC) patients receiving postoperative adjuvant transarterial chemoembolization 
      (PA-TACE). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Clinical data of HCC patients who underwent 
      hepatectomy at four medical centers were retrospectively analyzed, including 
      those who received PA-TACE and those who did not. These two categories of 
      patients were randomly allocated to the development and validation cohorts in a 
      7:3 ratio. RESULTS: A total of 1505 HCC patients who underwent hepatectomy were 
      included in this study, comprising 723 patients who did not receive PA-TACE and 
      782 patients who received PA-TACE. Among them, patients who received PA-TACE 
      experienced more adverse events, although these events were mild and manageable 
      (Grade 1-2, all p < 0.05). Nomograms were constructed and validated for patients 
      with and without PA-TACE using independent predictors that influenced 
      disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS). These two nomograms had 
      C-indices greater than 0.800 in the development cohort and exhibited good 
      calibration and discrimination ability compared to six conventional HCC staging 
      systems. Patients in the intermediate-to-high-risk group in the nomogram who 
      received PA-TACE had higher DFS and OS (all p < 0.05). In addition, tumor 
      recurrence was significantly controlled in the intermediate-to-high-risk group of 
      patients who received PA-TACE, while there was no significant difference in the 
      low-risk group of patients who received PA-TACE. CONCLUSION: The nomograms were 
      developed and validated based on large-scale clinical data and can serve as 
      online decision-making tools to predict survival benefits from PA-TACE in 
      different subgroups of patients.

TI  - Talazoparib in Patients With Solid Tumors With BRCA1/2 Mutation: Results From the 
      Targeted Agent and Profiling Utilization Registry Study.
PG  - e2400026
LID - 10.1200/PO.24.00026 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: The Targeted Agent and Profiling Utilization Registry Study is a phase 
      II basket trial evaluating the antitumor activity of commercially available 
      targeted agents in patients with advanced cancer and genomic alterations known to 
      be drug targets. Results of a cohort of patients with various solid tumors with 
      germline or somatic BRCA1/2 mutations treated with talazoparib are reported. 
      METHODS: Eligible patients had advanced solid tumors, measurable disease 
      (RECIST), Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status 0-2, adequate 
      organ function, and no standard treatment options. Patients with germline 
      BRCA-mutated human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-negative locally advanced 
      or metastatic breast cancer were not eligible for this study. Primary end point 
      was disease control (DC) determined by investigator assessment of objective 
      response (OR) or stable disease (SD) of at least 16 weeks duration (SD16+). The 
      results were evaluated on the basis of a one-sided exact binomial test with a 
      null DC rate of 15% versus 35% (power = 0.82; α = .10). Secondary end points were 
      OR, progression-free survival, overall survival, duration of response, duration 
      of SD, and safety. RESULTS: Twenty-eight patients (20 cancer types) with BRCA1/2 
      mutations were enrolled from December 2019 to September 2021 and collapsed into a 
      single histology pooled cohort for analysis. All patients were evaluable for 
      efficacy. One complete response, nine partial response, and six SD16+ were 
      observed for DC and OR rates of 57% (one-sided 90% CI, 43 to 100) and 36% (95% 
      CI, 19 to 56), respectively. The null hypothesis of a 15% DC rate was rejected (P 
      < .001). Patients with OR had the following tumor types: breast (2), nonmelanoma 
      skin, mesothelioma, stomach, uterus, non-small cell lung cancer, ovary, 
      hepatocellular carcinoma, and pancreas. Thirteen patients had at least one grade 
      3-5 adverse event (AE) or serious AE at least possibly related to talazoparib. 
      All were consistent with the drug label except bilirubin increase and 
      hyponatremia (both grade 3 AEs). CONCLUSION: Talazoparib demonstrated antitumor 
      activity in patients with advanced solid tumors and BRCA1/2 mutations, including 
      cancer types for which poly ADP-ribose polymerase inhibitors are not yet US Food 
      and Drug Administration-approved.

TI  - mhealth-based interventions to improving liver cancer screening among high-risk 
      populations: a study protocol for a randomized controlled trial.
PG  - 2501
LID - 10.1186/s12889-024-20025-7 [doi]
LID - 2501
AB  - BACKGROUND: Liver cancer (LC) screening, such as AFP test and abdominal 
      ultrasound, is an effective way to prevent LC, one of the most common cancers 
      worldwide. Despite the proven screening benefits, screening participation among 
      high-risk populations for LC remains low. This suggests that targeted, 
      systematic, and effective interventions should be provided to improve knowledge 
      and awareness related to LC screening, enhance screening intentions, and thereby 
      promote screening behaviors. Telephone is people's main medium of daily 
      communication and mHealth-based programs offer a potential and effective solution 
      for promoting health behaviors. The purpose of this study is to develop and 
      implement a mHealth (WeChat app) based intervention guided by Fogg's Behavior 
      Model (FBM) to augment the knowledge of LC prevention among people at risk of LC 
      and enhance their motivation for screening, and to validate its effectiveness in 
      improving LC screening. METHODS: We propose a two-arm, single-blind randomized 
      controlled trial with 82 at-risk individuals of LC, delivering a 6-month 
      mHealth-based intervention program with optional health counseling. Recruitment 
      will be through tertiary hospitals and community organizations in 4 districts in 
      Heng Yang. In total, 82 individuals at high risk for HCC will be randomized 1:1 
      to intervention or control (usual care) groups. The intervention group will 
      receive intervention, whose contents are based on the FBM model, via multiple 
      forms of media including PowerPoint presentation, multimedia video, health 
      information booklet and screening message, which is delivered in the WeChat 
      Applet. Control dyads will be provided with usual health education. Outcomes will 
      be assessed at baseline and post-intervention. DISCUSSION: The findings of this 
      study will provide evidence of the benefits of utilizing mHealth-based approaches 
      in intervention development to enhance the effectiveness of screening adherence 
      for high-risk people of LC. Further, the findings would provide reference to the 
      potential incorporation of the targeted intervention in local community 
      organizations. TRIAL REGISTRATION: Chinese Clinical Trial Registry 
      (ChiCTR2400080530) Date registered: 31/1/2024.

TI  - An algorithm for simplified hepatitis C virus treatment with non-specialist care 
      based on nation-wide data from Taiwan.
PG  - 461-475
LID - 10.1007/s12072-023-10609-7 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Both European Association for the Study of the Liver (EASL) and 
      American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases and the Infectious Diseases 
      Society of America (AASLD-IDSA) guidelines recommend simplified hepatitis C virus 
      (HCV) treatment with pan-genotypic sofosbuvir/velpatasvir or 
      glecaprevir/pibrentasvir for eligible patients. This observational study used 
      real-world data to assess these regimens' safety in eligible patients and develop 
      an algorithm to identify patients suitable for simplified treatment by 
      non-specialists. METHODS: 7,677 HCV-infected patients from Taiwan Hepatitis C 
      Registry (TACR) who received at least one dose of sofosbuvir/velpatasvir or 
      glecaprevir/pibrentasvir, and fulfilled the EASL/AASLD-IDSA criteria for 
      simplified treatment were analyzed. Multivariate analysis was conducted on 
      patient characteristics and safety data. RESULTS: Overall, 92.8% (7,128/7,677) of 
      patients achieved sustained virological response and only 1.9% (146/7,677) 
      experienced Grades 2-4 laboratory abnormalities in key liver function parameters 
      (alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, and total bilirubin), with 
      only 18 patients (0.23%) experiencing Grades 3-4 abnormalities. Age > 70 years 
      old, presence of hepatocellular carcinoma, total bilirubin > 1.2 mg/dL, estimated 
      glomerular filtration rate < 60 mL/min/1.73 m(2), and Fibrosis-4 > 3.25 were 
      associated with higher risks of Grades 2-4 abnormalities. Patients with any of 
      these had an odds of 4.53 times than that of those without in developing Grades 
      2-4 abnormalities (p < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Real-world data from Taiwan confirmed 
      that simplified HCV treatment for eligible patients with pan-genotypic regimens 
      is effective and well tolerated. The TACR algorithm, developed based on this 
      study's results, can further identify patients who can be safely managed by 
      non-specialist care.

TI  - Preoperative sintilimab plus transarterial chemoembolization for hepatocellular 
      carcinoma exceeding the Milan criteria: A phase II trial.
PG  - e0054

LID - e0054
AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Many patients with HCC of Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer 
      (BCLC) stage A exceeding the Milan criteria, or of BCLC stage B, can undergo 
      resection after successful preoperative therapy, but an optimal approach has not 
      been identified. We investigated preoperative drug-eluting bead transarterial 
      chemoembolization (DEB-TACE) plus sintilimab, in this setting. APPROACH AND 
      RESULTS: In this prospective, phase II study (NCT04174781), adults with HCC of 
      BCLC stage A exceeding the Milan criteria, or BCLC stage B, and ineligible for 
      surgical resection, received sintilimab 200 mg and DEB-TACE. The primary endpoint 
      was progression-free survival by modified RECIST. Secondary endpoints included 
      objective response rate, pathologic response rate, and safety. At the data cutoff 
      (July 2022), among 60 patients, the objective response rate was 62% (37/60) and 
      51 patients had undergone surgery. After a median follow-up of 26.0 months 
      (range, 3.4-31.8), the median progression-free survival was 30.5 months (95% CI: 
      16.1-not reached). Among patients undergoing surgery, median progression-free 
      survival was not reached and the 12-month progression-free survival rate was 76% 
      (95% CI: 67-91). A pathologic complete response was achieved in 14% (7/51) of 
      these patients. All patients experienced at least one adverse event, but these 
      were generally manageable. Exploratory analyses showed an association between 
      cytokeratin, V-domain Ig-containing Suppressor of T-cell Activation, CD68, CD169, 
      and cluster 13 fibroblasts and recurrence after surgery. CONCLUSIONS: Sintilimab 
      plus DEB-TACE before surgery showed good efficacy and safety in patients with HCC 
      of BCLC stage A exceeding the Milan criteria or BCLC stage B.

TI  - Comparison of drug-eluting bead with conventional transcatheter arterial 
      chemoembolization for hepatocellular carcinoma with portal vein tumor thrombus: a 
      randomized clinical trial.
PG  - 5527-5537
LID - 10.1097/JS9.0000000000001691 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Drug-eluting bead transarterial chemoembolization (DEB-TACE) has 
      shown efficacy for treating hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) with portal vein tumor 
      thrombus (PVTT). However, whether DEB-TACE is superior to conventional TACE 
      (cTACE) remains unclear. OBJECTIVE: This randomized controlled trial aimed to 
      compare the efficacy and safety of DEB-TACE versus cTACE in treating HCC with 
      PVTT. METHODS: The study was conducted at a tertiary care center in Southeast 
      China. HCC patients with PVTT were randomized at a 1:1 ratio into the DEB-TACE or 
      cTACE groups. The primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS), and the 
      secondary endpoints were overall survival (OS) and the incidence of adverse 
      events (AEs). An independent review committee assessed the radiologic response 
      according to the modified Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (mRECIST). 
      AEs were assessed by the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) 
      version 4.0. Systemic therapies were not restricted. RESULTS: Between September 
      2018 and July 2020, 163 patients were randomized to undergo DEB-TACE ( n =82) or 
      cTACE ( n =81). Nine patients were excluded, and 154 patients were included in 
      the final analysis; the median age was 55 years (range, 24-78 years), and 140 
      (90.9%) were male. The median PFS in the DEB-TACE group was 6.0 months (95% CI, 
      5.0-10.0) versus 4.0 months (95% CI, 3.0-5.0) in the cTACE group (hazard ratio, 
      0.63; 95% CI, 0.42-0.95; P =0.027). The DEB-TACE group showed a higher response 
      rate [51 (66.2%) vs. 36 (46.8%); P =0.0015] and a longer median OS [12.0 months 
      (95% CI, 9.0-16.0) vs. 8.0 months (95% CI, 7.0-11.0), P =0.039] than the cTACE 
      group. Multivariate analysis showed that the treatment group, ALBI score, distant 
      metastasis and additional TKIs were the four independent prognostic factors 
      correlated with PFS. In addition, the treatment group, PVTT group and combination 
      with surgery were independently associated with OS. AEs were similar in the two 
      groups, and postembolization syndrome was the most frequent AE. CONCLUSION: 
      DEB-TACE is superior to cTACE in treating HCC patients with PVTT, demonstrating 
      improved PFS and OS with an acceptable safety profile, and may thus emerge as a 
      promising treatment strategy for HCC patients with PVTT. TRIAL REGISTRATION:

TI  - Nomograms for postsurgical extrahepatic recurrence prediction of hepatocellular 
      carcinoma based on presurgical circulating tumor cell status and 
      clinicopathological factors.
PG  - 15065-15078
LID - 10.1002/cam4.6178 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Extrahepatic recurrence (EHR) is one of the major reasons 
      for the poor prognosis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The present study aimed 
      to develop and assess the performance of predictive models by using a combination 
      of presurgical circulating tumor cell (CTCs) data and clinicopathological 
      features to screen patients at high risk of EHR to achieve precise 
      decision-making. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 227 patients with recurrent HCC 
      and preoperative CTC data from January 2014 to August 2019 were enrolled. All 
      patients were randomly assigned to one of two cohorts: development or validation. 
      Two preoperative and postoperative nomogram models for EHR prediction were 
      developed and multi-dimensionally validated. RESULTS: Patients with EHR had 
      generally lower recurrence-free survival (p < 0.001), and overall survival 
      (p < 0.001), and significantly higher CTC counts (epithelial CTCs, 
      epithelial/mesenchymal hybrid CTCs, and mesenchymal CTCs count, all p < 0.05) 
      than those without EHR. Univariate and multivariate analyses revealed that EHR 
      was associated with four risk factors in the development cohort: total CTC count 
      (p = 0.014), tumor size (p = 0.028), node number (p = 0.045), and microvascular 
      invasion (p = 0.035). These factors were incorporated into two nomogram models 
      (preoperative and postoperative), which reliably predicted EHR through 
      multidimensional verification (e.g., calibration plot, receiver operating 
      characteristic analysis, decision curve analysis, and clinical impact curve 
      analysis) in the development and validation cohorts, respectively. With threshold 
      of scores of 100.3 and 176.8 before and after surgery respectively, both 
      nomograms were able to stratify patients into two distinct prognostic subgroups 
      (all p < 0.05). CONCLUSION: The present study proposed two nomogram models 
      integrating presurgical CTC counts and clinicopathological risks and showed 
      relatively good predictive performance of EHR, which may be beneficial to the 
      clinical practice of HCC recurrence. Further multicenter studies are needed to 
      assess its general applicability.

TI  - Low Pneumoperitoneum Pressure Reduces Gas Embolism During Laparoscopic Liver 
      Resection: A Randomized Controlled Trial.
PG  - 588-597
LID - 10.1097/SLA.0000000000006130 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To compare the effect of low and standard pneumoperitoneal pressure 
      (PP) on the occurrence of gas embolism during laparoscopic liver resection (LLR). 
      BACKGROUND: LLR has an increased risk of gas embolism. Although animal studies 
      have shown that low PP reduces the occurrence of gas embolism, clinical evidence 
      is lacking. METHODS: This parallel, dual-arm, double-blind, randomized controlled 
      trial included 141 patients undergoing elective LLR. Patients were randomized 
      into standard ("S," 15 mm Hg; n = 70) or low ("L," 10 mm Hg; n = 71) PP groups. 
      Severe gas embolism (≥ grade 3, based on the Schmandra microbubble method) was 
      detected using transesophageal echocardiography and recorded as the primary 
      outcome. Intraoperative vital signs and postoperative recovery profiles were also 
      evaluated. RESULTS: Fewer severe gas embolism cases (n = 29, 40.8% vs n = 47, 
      67.1%, P = 0.003), fewer abrupt decreases in end-tidal carbon dioxide partial 
      pressure, shorter severe gas embolism duration, less peripheral oxygen saturation 
      reduction, and fewer increases in heart rate and lactate during gas embolization 
      episodes was found in group L than in group S. Moreover, a higher arterial 
      partial pressure of oxygen and peripheral oxygen saturation were observed, and 
      fewer fluids and vasoactive drugs were administered in group L than in group S. 
      In both groups, the distensibility index of the inferior vena cava negatively 
      correlated with central venous pressure throughout LLR, and a comparable quality 
      of recovery was observed. CONCLUSIONS: Low PP reduced the incidence and duration 
      of severe gas embolism and achieved steadier hemodynamics and vital signs during 
      LLR. Therefore, a low PP strategy can be considered a valuable choice for the 
      future LLR.

TI  - Comparison of non-radiomics imaging features and radiomics models based on 
      contrast-enhanced ultrasound and Gd-EOB-DTPA-enhanced MRI for predicting 
      microvascular invasion in hepatocellular carcinoma within 5 cm.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study is to establish microvascular invasion 
      (MVI) prediction models based on preoperative contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) 
      and ethoxybenzyl-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (EOB-MRI) in patients with a 
      single hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) ≤ 5 cm. METHODS: Patients with a single 
      HCC ≤ 5 cm and accepting CEUS and EOB-MRI before surgery were enrolled in this 
      study. Totally, 85 patients were randomly divided into the training and 
      validation cohorts in a ratio of 7:3. Non-radiomics imaging features, the CEUS 
      and EOB-MRI radiomics scores were extracted from the arterial phase, portal phase 
      and delayed phase images of CEUS and the hepatobiliary phase images of EOB-MRI. 
      Different MVI predicting models based on CEUS and EOB-MRI were constructed and 
      their predictive values were evaluated. RESULTS: Since univariate analysis 
      revealed that arterial peritumoral enhancement on the CEUS image, CEUS radiomics 
      score, and EOB-MRI radiomics score were significantly associated with MVI, three 
      prediction models, namely the CEUS model, the EOB-MRI model, and the CEUS-EOB 
      model, were developed. In the validation cohort, the areas under the receiver 
      operating characteristic curve of the CEUS model, the EOB-MRI model, and the 
      CEUS-EOB model were 0.73, 0.79, and 0.86, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Radiomics 
      scores based on CEUS and EOB-MRI, combined with arterial peritumoral enhancement 
      on CEUS, show a satisfying performance of MVI predicting. There was no 
      significant difference in the efficacy of MVI risk evaluation between radiomics 
      models based on CEUS and EOB-MRI in patients with a single HCC ≤ 5 cm. CLINICAL 
      RELEVANCE STATEMENT: Radiomics models based on CEUS and EOB-MRI are effective for 
      MVI predicting and conducive to pretreatment decision-making in patients with a 
      single HCC within 5 cm. KEY POINTS: • Radiomics scores based on CEUS and EOB-MRI, 
      combined with arterial peritumoral enhancement on CEUS, show a satisfying 
      performance of MVI predicting. • There was no significant difference in the 
      efficacy of MVI risk evaluation between radiomics models based on CEUS and 
      EOB-MRI in patients with a single HCC ≤ 5 cm.

TI  - Feasibility, safety, efficacy and potential scaling-up of sofosbuvir-based HCV 
      treatment in Central and West Africa: (TAC ANRS 12311 trial).

AB  - Access to Hepatis C treatment in Sub-Saharan Africa is a clinical, public health 
      and ethical concern. The multi-country open-label trial TAC ANRS 12311 allowed 
      assessing the feasibility, safety, efficacy of a specific care model of HCV 
      treatment and retreatment in patients with hepatitis C in Sub Saharan Africa. 
      Between November 2015 and March 2017, with follow-up until mid 2019, 
      treatment-naïve patients with HCV without decompensated cirrhosis or liver cancer 
      were recruited to receive 12 week-treatment with either sofosbuvir + ribavirin 
      (HCV genotype 2) or sofosbuvir + ledipasvir (genotype 1 or 4) and retreatment 
      with sofosbuvir + velpatasvir + voxilaprevir in case of virological failure. The 
      primary outcome was sustained virological response at 12 weeks after end of 
      treatment (SVR12). Secondary outcomes included treatment adherence, safety and 
      SVR12 in patients who were retreated due to non-response to first-line treatment. 
      The model of care relied on both viral load assessment and educational sessions 
      to increase patient awareness, adherence and health literacy. The study recruited 
      120 participants, 36 HIV-co-infected, and 14 cirrhotic. Only one patient 
      discontinued treatment because of return to home country. Neither death nor 
      severe adverse event occurred. SVR12 was reached in 107 patients (89%): (90%) in 
      genotype 1 or 2, and 88% in GT-4. All retreated patients (n = 13) reached SVR12. 
      HCV treatment is highly acceptable, safe and effective under this model of care. 
      Implementation research is now needed to scale up point-of-care HCV testing and 
      SVR assessment, along with community involvement in patient education, to achieve 
      HCV elimination in Sub-Saharan Africa.

TI  - A phase 2a study investigating the effects of ritlecitinib on brainstem auditory 
      evoked potentials and intraepidermal nerve fiber histology in adults with 
      alopecia areata.
PG  - e1204
LID - 10.1002/prp2.1204 [doi]

AB  - Reversible axonal swelling and brainstem auditory evoked potential (BAEP) changes 
      were observed in standard chronic (9-month) toxicology studies in dogs treated 
      with ritlecitinib, an oral Janus kinase 3/tyrosine kinase expressed in 
      hepatocellular carcinoma family kinase inhibitor, at exposures higher than the 
      approved 50-mg human dose. To evaluate the clinical relevance of the dog toxicity 
      finding, this phase 2a, double-blind study assessed BAEP changes and 
      intraepidermal nerve fiber (IENF) histology in adults with alopecia areata 
      treated with ritlecitinib. Patients were randomized to receive oral ritlecitinib 
      50 mg once daily (QD) with a 4-week loading dose of 200 mg QD or placebo for 
      9 months (placebo-controlled phase); they then entered the active-therapy 
      extension and received ritlecitinib 50 mg QD (with a 4-week loading dose of 
      200 mg in patients switching from placebo). Among the 71 patients, no notable 
      mean differences in change from baseline (CFB) in Waves I-V interwave latency 
      (primary outcome) or Wave V amplitude on BAEP at a stimulus intensity of 80 dB 
      nHL were observed in the ritlecitinib or placebo group at Month 9, with no 
      notable differences in interwave latency or Wave V amplitude between groups. The 
      CFB in mean or median IENF density and in percentage of IENFs with axonal 
      swellings was minimal and similar between groups at Month 9. Ritlecitinib 
      treatment was also not associated with an imbalanced incidence of neurological 
      and audiological adverse events. These results provide evidence that the BAEP and 
      axonal swelling finding in dogs are not clinically relevant in humans.

TI  - VB-111 (ofranergene obadenovec) in combination with nivolumab in patients with 
      microsatellite stable colorectal liver metastases: a single center, single arm, 
      phase II trial.
LID - 10.1136/jitc-2023-008079 [doi]
LID - e008079
AB  - BACKGROUND: Microsatellite stable colorectal liver metastases (MSS CLM) maintain 
      an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME). Historically, immune-based 
      approaches have been ineffective. VB-111 (ofranergene obadenovec) is a 
      genetically-modified adenoviral vector targeting the TME; its unique dual 
      mechanism induces an immune response and disrupts neovascularization. Checkpoint 
      inhibition may synergize the immune response induced by viral-mediated 
      anti-angiogenic gene therapy. We aimed to examine the safety and antitumor 
      activity of VB-111 and nivolumab in patients with refractory MSS CLM and to 
      characterize immunological treatment-response. METHODS: This was a phase II study 
      of adult patients with histologically-confirmed MSS CLM who progressed on prior 
      therapy. A priming dose of VB-111 1×10(13) viral particles was given 
      intravenously 2 weeks prior to starting biweekly nivolumab 240 mg and continued 
      every 6 weeks. The combination continued until disease progression or 
      unacceptable toxicity. The primary objectives were overall response rate and 
      safety/tolerability. Secondary objectives included median overall survival and 
      progression-free survival. Correlative studies were performed on paired tumor 
      biopsies and blood. RESULTS: Between August 2020 and December 2021, 14 patients 
      were enrolled with median age 50.5 years (40-75), and 14% were women. Median 
      follow-up was 5.5 months. Of the 10 evaluable patients, the combination of VB-111 
      and nivolumab failed to demonstrate radiographic responses; at best, 2 patients 
      had stable disease. Median overall survival was 5.5 months (95% CI: 2.3 to 10.8), 
      and median progression-free survival was 1.8 months (95% CI: 1.4 to 1.9). The 
      most common grade 3-4 treatment-related adverse events were fever/chills, 
      influenza-like symptoms, and lymphopenia. No treatment-related deaths were 
      reported. Qualitative analysis of immunohistochemical staining of paired tumor 
      biopsies did not demonstrate significant immune infiltration after treatment, 
      except for one patient who had exceptional survival (26.0 months). Immune 
      analysis of peripheral blood mononuclear cells showed an increase of 
      PD-1(high)Ki67(high)CD8(+) T cells and HLA-DR(high) T cells after VB-111 priming 
      dose. Plasma cytokines interleukin-10 and tumor necrosis factor-α increased after 
      treatment with both drugs. CONCLUSION: In patients with MSS CLM, VB-111 and 
      nivolumab did not improve overall response rate or survival but were tolerated 
      with minimal toxicities. While challenging to distinguish between antiviral or 
      antitumor, correlative studies demonstrated an immune response with activation 
      and proliferation of CD8(+) T cells systemically that was poorly sustained. TRIAL 
      REGISTRATION NUMBER: NCT04166383.

TI  - A Phase 1/2 Multicenter Randomized Trial of Local Ablation plus Toripalimab 
      versus Toripalimab Alone for Previously Treated Unresectable Hepatocellular 
      Carcinoma.
PG  - 2816-2825
LID - 10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-23-0410 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: To assess the safety and efficacy of local ablation plus PD-1 inhibitor 
      toripalimab in previously treated unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). 
      PATIENTS AND METHODS: In the multicenter, two-stage, and randomized phase 1/2 
      trial, patients were randomly assigned to receive toripalimab alone (240 mg, 
      every 3 weeks), subtotal local ablation followed by toripalimab starting on 
      post-ablation day 3 (Schedule D3), or on post-ablation day 14 (Schedule D14). The 
      first endpoint of stage 1 was to determine which combination schedule could 
      continue and progression-free survival (PFS) as the primary endpoint for stage 
      1/2. RESULTS: A total of 146 patients were recruited. During stage 1, Schedule D3 
      achieved numerically higher objective response rate (ORR) than Schedule D14 for 
      non-ablation lesions (37.5% vs. 31.3%), and was chosen for stage 2 evaluation. 
      For the entire cohort of both stages, patients with Schedule D3 had a 
      significantly higher ORR than with toripalimab alone (33.8% vs. 16.9%; P = 
      0.027). Moreover, patients with Schedule D3 had improved median PFS (7.1 vs. 3.8 
      months; P < 0.001) and median overall survival (18.4 vs. 13.2 months; P = 0.005), 
      as compared with toripalimab alone. In addition, six (9%) patients with 
      toripalimab, eight (12%) with Schedule D3, and 4 (25%) with Schedule D14 
      developed grade 3 or 4 adverse events, and one patient (2%) with Schedule D3 
      manifested grade 5 treatment-related pneumonitis. CONCLUSIONS: In patients with 
      previously treated unresectable HCC, subtotal ablation plus toripalimab improved 
      the clinical efficacy as compared with toripalimab alone, with an acceptable 
      safety profile.

LID - 10.1177/1357633X231166032 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Real-world hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) surveillance uptake remains 
      suboptimal, despite evidence that surveillance is associated with lower 
      cancer-related mortality in patients with cirrhosis and chronic hepatitis B. We 
      aimed to examine the impact of telehealth consultations on HCC surveillance rates 
      within a specialist liver clinic. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective 
      observational study within an Australian outreach liver clinic within a 
      culturally diverse community, comparing standard consultations before the 
      COVID-19 pandemic to telehealth consultations during the pandemic. The primary 
      outcome was surveillance uptake defined as the percentage of time up-to-date with 
      surveillance (PTUDS) with the 6-month interval following each scan considered 
      up-to-date. RESULTS: Over 18 months of follow-up for each cohort, the median 
      PTUDS was 86.5% in the standard consultation cohort and 85.5% in the telehealth 
      consultation cohort (p = 0.12). HCC diagnoses did not differ between groups and 
      hospitalisation and mortality rates were low. Using multivariate regression, 
      increasing age, the need for an interpreter and being born in South-East Asia 
      independently predicted PTUDS in the standard consultation cohort, whereas being 
      born in Australia or New Zealand was predictive of a lower PTUDS. Current alcohol 
      use and distance from the clinic predicted a lower PTUDS in the telehealth 
      consultation cohort. In both groups, missed clinic attendances were strongly 
      predictive of a lower PTUDS. CONCLUSION: Telehealth hepatology consultations 
      effectively coordinate HCC surveillance and are associated with similar outcomes 
      to standard consultations. Its implementation should be widely considered given 
      its advantages with regards to accessibility for patients.

TI  - The effect of probiotic supplementation on non-alcoholic fatty liver disease 
      (NAFLD) fibrosis score in patients attending a tertiary hospital clinic in Cairo, 
      Egypt.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is characterized by hepatic 
      fat accumulation (> 5% of liver tissue) in the absence of alcohol abuse or other 
      chronic liver diseases. NAFLD can progress to non-alcoholic steatohepatitis 
      (NASH), fibrosis, cirrhosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). This study aimed 
      to assess the efficacy of probiotic (lactobacillus) supplementation on NAFLD 
      fibrosis score. METHODOLOGY: A double-arm randomized controlled trial was 
      conducted in the family medicine clinic of a tertiary hospital, enrolling 
      patients with sonographic evidence of NAFLD. Fifty patients were divided into two 
      groups: the Probiotic group received lifestyle modification instructions along 
      with daily probiotic supplementation for twelve weeks, with regular monthly 
      follow-up visits. The Standard Treatment group received low-fat diet and 
      lifestyle modification instructions only. RESULTS: The mean age of participants 
      was 46.10 years (SD 10.11), with 70% females and 30% males. The study found a 
      statistically significant difference in liver enzymes (ALT and AST) and BMI in 
      the probiotic group before and after intervention. However, there was no 
      significant difference in NAFLD fibrosis score between the two groups. 
      CONCLUSION: Short-term probiotic treatment resulted in improvements in ALT, AST, 
      and BMI in the probiotic group, but did not significantly affect NAFLD fibrosis 
      score. Further research with larger sample sizes and longer follow-up periods is 
      warranted. TRIAL REGISTRATION: The clinical trial was registered at Protocol 
      Registration and Results System with number NCT06074094 (12/09/2021).

TI  - Carvedilol to prevent decompensation of cirrhosis in patients with clinically 
      significant portal hypertension stratified by liver stiffness: study protocol for 
      a randomied, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicentre trial in China.
PG  - e081623

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Patients with clinically significant portal hypertension (CSPH) are 
      recommended to be treated with non-selective beta-blockers (ie, carvedilol) to 
      prevent the first hepatic decompensation event by the renewing Baveno VII 
      consensus. CSPH is defined by hepatic venous pressure gradient (HVPG)≥10 mm Hg; 
      however, the HVPG measurement is not widely adopted due to its invasiveness. 
      Liver stiffness (LS)≥25 kPa can be used as a surrogate of HVPG≥10 mm Hg to rule 
      in CSPH with 90% of the positive predicting value in majority aetiologies of 
      patients. A compelling argument is existing for using LS≥25 kPa to diagnose CSPH 
      and then to initiate carvedilol in patients with compensated cirrhosis, and about 
      5%-6% of patients under this diagnosis criteria may not be benefited from 
      carvedilol and are at risk of lower heart rate and mean arterial pressure. 
      Randomised controlled trial on the use of carvedilol to prevent liver 
      decompensation in CSPH diagnosed by LS remains to elucidate. Therefore, we aimed 
      to investigate if compensated cirrhosis patients with LS≥25 kPa may benefit from 
      carvedilol therapy. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: This study is a randomised, 
      double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicentre trial. We will randomly assign 446 
      adult compensated cirrhosis patients with LS≥25 kPa and without any previous 
      decompensated event and without high-risk gastro-oesophageal varices. Patients 
      are randomly divided into two groups, with 223 subjects in group A and 223 
      subjects in group B. Group A is a carvedilol intervention group, while group B is 
      a placebo group. All patients in both groups will receive aetiology therapies and 
      are followed up at an interval of 6 months. The 3-year incidences of 
      decompensated events of cirrhosis-related and liver-related death are the primary 
      outcome. The secondary outcomes include development of each complication of 
      portal hypertension individually (ascites, variceal bleeding or overt hepatic 
      encephalopathy), development of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis and other 
      bacterial infections, development of new varices, growth of small varices to 
      large varices, delta changes in LS and spleen stiffness, change in hepatic 
      dysfunction assessed by Child-Pugh and model for end-stage liver disease score, 
      change in platelet count, development of hepatocellular carcinoma, development of 
      portal vein thrombosis and adverse events with a 3-year follow-up. A predefined 
      interim analysis will be performed to ensure that the calculation is reasonable. 
      ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The study protocol has been approved by the ethics 
      committees of the Sixth People's Hospital of Shenyang (2023-05-003-01) and 
      independent ethics committee for clinical research of Zhongda Hospital, 
      affiliated to Southeast University (2023ZDSYLL433-P01). The results from this 
      trial will be submitted for publication in peer-reviewed journals and will be 
      presented at international conferences. TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER:

TI  - Asia-Pacific multicentre randomized trial of laparoscopic versus open major 
      hepatectomy for hepatocellular carcinoma (AP-LAPO trial).
LID - 10.1093/bjsopen/zrac166 [doi]
LID - zrac166
AB  - BACKGROUND: Hepatocellular carcinoma is the sixth most common malignancy in the 
      world. Major hepatectomy (resection of greater than or equal to three liver 
      segments) is needed if a tumour is large or close to major blood vessels. Despite 
      low mortality, open major hepatectomy is associated with high rates of tumour 
      recurrence that limits survival. Laparoscopic major hepatectomy has been proposed 
      as an alternative approach with potential oncological benefits. This study 
      compares laparoscopic major hepatectomy with open major hepatectomy for 
      hepatocellular carcinoma in a randomized trial. METHODS: The Asia-Pacific 
      multicentre randomized trial of laparoscopic versus open major hepatectomy for 
      hepatocellular carcinoma (AP-LAPO trial) is an open-labelled multicentre 
      randomized trial to be conducted in five centres in the Asia-Pacific region. The 
      study will test the hypothesis that laparoscopic major hepatectomy for 
      hepatocellular carcinoma is associated with less tumour recurrence and better 
      survival compared with open major hepatectomy; the primary outcome being 2-year 
      recurrence-free survival. Secondary outcomes include hospital mortality, 
      postoperative complications according to the Clavien-Dindo classification, time

AB  - BACKGROUND: In addition to improving survival outcomes, new oncology treatments 
      should lead to amelioration of patients' quality of life (QoL). Herein, we 
      examined whether QoL results correlated with PFS and OS outcomes in phase III 
      randomized controlled trials (RCTs) investigating new systemic treatments in 
      metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). METHODS: The systematic search of 
      PubMed was conducted in October 2022. We identified 81 RCTs testing novel drugs 
      in metastatic NSCLC and published in the English language in a PubMed-indexed 
      journal between 2012 and 2021. Only trials reporting QoL results and at least one 
      survival outcome between OS and PFS were selected. For each RCT, we assessed 
      whether global QoL was "superior," "inferior," or with "non-statistically 
      significant difference" in the experimental arm compared to the control arm. 
      RESULTS: Experimental treatments led to superior QoL in 30 (37.0%) RCTs and 
      inferior QoL in 3 (3.7%) RCTs. In the remaining 48 (59.3%) RCTs, a statistically 
      significant difference between the experimental and control arms was not found. 
      Of note, we found a statistically significant association between QoL and PFS 
      improvements (X(2) = 3.93, p = 0.0473). In more detail, this association was not 
      significant in trials testing immunotherapy or chemotherapy. On the contrary, in 
      RCTs testing target therapies, QoL results positively correlated with PFS 
      outcomes (p = 0.0196). This association was even stronger in the 32 trials 
      testing EGFR or ALK inhibitors (p = 0.0077). On the other hand, QoL results did 
      not positively correlate with OS outcomes (X(2) = 0.81, p = 0.368). Furthermore, 
      we found that experimental treatments led to superior QoL in 27/57 (47.4%) trials 
      with positive results and in 3/24 (12.5%) RCTs with negative results 
      (p = 0.0028). Finally, we analyzed how QoL data were described in publications of 
      RCTs in which QoL outcomes were not improved (n = 51). We found that a favorable 
      description of QoL results was associated with sponsorship by industries 
      (p = 0.0232). CONCLUSIONS: Our study reveals a positive association of QoL 
      results with PFS outcomes in RCTs testing novel treatments in metastatic NSCLC. 
      This association is particularly evident for target therapies. These findings 
      further emphasize the relevance of an accurate assessment of QoL in RCTs in 
      NSCLC.

TI  - Role of CENPF and NDC80 in the rehabilitation nursing of hepatocellular carcinoma 
      and cirrhosis: An observational study.

AB  - Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the most common malignant tumors 
      globally and often develops on the foundation of chronic liver disease or 
      cirrhosis. Cirrhosis is a clinically prevalent chronic progressive liver disease 
      characterized by diffuse liver damage resulting from long-term or repeated 
      actions of 1 or more etiological factors. However, the impact of CENPF and 
      nuclear division cycle 80 (NDC80) genes on rehabilitation nursing of HCC and 
      cirrhosis remains unclear. HCC and cirrhosis datasets GSE63898 and GSE89377 
      profile files were downloaded from the gene expression omnibus database generated 
      on platforms GPL13667 and GPL6947, respectively. Differentially expressed genes 
      (DEGs) screening, weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA), 
      construction and analysis of protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks, 
      functional enrichment analysis, gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA), survival 
      analysis, immune infiltration analysis, and comparative toxicogenomics database 
      (CTD) analysis were conducted. Gene expression heatmaps were plotted. miRNAs 
      regulating central DEGs were selected through TargetScan. A total of 626 DEGs 
      were identified. According to gene ontology (GO) analysis, they were primarily 
      enriched in small molecule metabolic processes, drug metabolic processes, binding 
      of identical proteins, and lipid metabolic processes. Kyoto Encyclopedia of Gene 
      and Genome (KEGG) analysis results indicated that the target genes were mainly 
      enriched in metabolic pathways, phagosomes, glycine, serine, and threonine 
      metabolism. The construction and analysis of the PPI network revealed 3 core 
      genes (NDC80, CENPF, RRM2). Gene expression heatmaps showed that core genes 
      (CENPF, NDC80) were highly expressed in HCC and cirrhosis samples. CTD analysis 
      found that 2 genes (CENPF and NDC80) were associated with liver, jaundice, 
      ascites, fever, dyspepsia, and hepatic encephalopathy. CENPF and NDC80 are highly 
      expressed in HCC and cirrhosis, and CENPF and NDC80 might be the biomarkers of 
      rehabilitation nursing of HCC and cirrhosis.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the fastest-rising and fourth 
      most common cause of cancer death worldwide. Liver cirrhosis is the largest 
      underlying risk factor for HCC. Therefore, patients with cirrhosis should have 
      regular ultrasound and biochemical screening to pick up early HCC. Early HCC can 
      be cured; more advanced HCCs have limited treatment options and poor prognosis. 
      Current screening methods are suboptimal with poor sensitivity in picking up 
      early disease. In this study, the investigators aim to recruit people with liver 
      cirrhosis into a Prospective cohort for early detection of liver cancer-the Pearl 
      cohort. The investigators believe that by using state-of-the-art tests we can 
      improve the detection of early HCC. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: This is a UK-based 
      prospective, longitudinal, diagnostic, prognostic, multicentre, non-CTIMP study. 
      Aiming to recruit 3000 patients with liver cirrhosis without a HCC diagnosis, the 
      Pearl cohort will be followed actively for 3 years from recruitment and then 
      passively via registry data for ten years thereafter. Blood and urine samples 
      will be taken and information from routine care will be gathered. These will be 
      used to assess novel diagnostic approaches for the detection early HCC and to 
      develop models to identify those most at risk for developing HCC.Participants 
      will be linked to national UK health registries to ensure long-term capture of 
      HCC incidence and other relevant endpoints. Approximately 75 patients are 
      predicted to develop de novo HCC within the 3-year follow up period. After this 
      period, the study teams will obtain data on participants for at least 10 years 
      after the last contact. This cohort will help develop an understanding of the 
      incidence of HCC in a UK population stratified by underlying cirrhosis aetiology. 
      ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Ethical approval has been granted by REC and the trial 
      is registered on ClinicalTrials.gov. The results will be published in 
      peer-reviewed journals and presented at relevant meetings. TRIAL REGISTRATION 
      NUMBER: NCT05541601.

AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: Hepatitis B virus infection frequently leads to liver fibrosis 
      and is the leading cause of hepatocellular carcinoma and cirrhosis in Asia 
      Pacific. Pirfenidone is approved by the United States Food and Drug 
      Administration for treatment of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, and hydronidone is 
      a novel structural modification of pirfenidone with the aim of reducing 
      hepatoxicity. We aimed to investigate the safety and efficacy of hydronidone in 
      patients with chronic hepatitis B (CHB)-associated liver fibrosis. METHODS: This 
      was a 52-week multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase II 
      study at 8 centers in China. Patients with CHB with biopsied documented liver 
      fibrosis were eligible and were randomly assigned into receiving daily placebo or 
      hydronidone orally (180 mg/day, 270 mg/day, or 360 mg/day). All enrolled subjects 
      also received entecavir 0.5 mg/day. A second liver biopsy was performed at week 
      52. The primary endpoint was defined as fibrosis improvement (reduction of at 
      least 1 Ishak score at week 52 of treatment). RESULTS: From June 25, 2015, to 
      September 5, 2019, 168 patients with CHB and liver fibrosis met the 
      inclusion/exclusion criteria and were subsequently randomized, 43 in the placebo 
      group and 125 in the hydronidone groups (42 in the 180-mg group, 42 in the 270-mg 
      group, and 41 in the 360-mg group). The fibrosis improvement endpoint was 
      achieved by 11 patients (25.6%) in the placebo group and 17 patients (40.5%) in 
      the 180-mg group (P = .12), 23 patients (54.8%) in the 270-mg group (P = .006), 
      and 18 patients (43.90%) in the 360-mg group (P = .08). The improvement rate was 
      58 of 125 (46.4%) in the combined hydronidone group (P = .014). The overall 
      safety profile and incidence of serious adverse events were similar among the 
      groups. CONCLUSIONS: Hydronidone plus entecavir showed clinically significant 
      histological improvement of liver fibrosis in patients with CHB, and the dose of 
      270 mg showed the best efficacy of fibrosis regression. Further studies are 
      required to assess the long-term effectiveness of hydronidone in regression of 
      hepatic fibrosis. CLINICALTRIALS: gov number, NCT02499562.

AB  - RATIONALE AND OBJECTIVE: Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) locoregional treatment 
      response is commonly evaluated using the Modified Response Evaluation Criteria in 
      Solid Tumors and the American College of Radiology (ACR) Liver Reporting and Data 
      System (LI-RADS) Treatment Response Assessment (TRA) for MRI/CT. This study aims 
      to evaluate the diagnostic performance of the new ACR contrast-enhanced 
      ultrasound (CEUS) Nonradiation TRA LI-RADS v2024 in HCC treated with 
      transarterial chemoembolization (TACE). MATERIALS AND METHODS: This retrospective 
      observational study included 87 patients treated with TACE from a previously 
      reported cohort. At 15- and 30-days post-treatment, 68 and 72 HCC lesions were 
      evaluated. Three blinded radiologists with different levels of CEUS experience 
      interpreted the images independently. According to CEUS Nonradiation TRA 
      LI-RADSv2024, both intralesional and perilesional tumor viability were evaluated 
      and final TRA categories were as follows: TR-Nonviable, TR-Equivocal, and 
      TR-Viable. The reference standard used was a composite of histology and imaging. 
      RESULTS: 140 HCC lesions were analyzed. At 15 days post-treatment, the 
      sensitivity (SN), specificity (SP), positive predictive value (PPV), negative 
      predictive value (NPV), and accuracy of TR-Viable classification ranged from 
      72.5-94.3%, 72.2-86.4%, 86.8-91.4%, 65.6-86.7%, 76.9-86.8%, respectively. At 30 
      days post-treatment, the SN, PPV, and NPV of TR-Viable classification decreased, 
      ranging from 65.9-84.2%, 85.7-90.6%, and 59.5-73.9%, respectively, while the SP 
      increased, ranging from 80.0-88.0%. Kappa values ranged from 0.557-0.730, 
      indicating moderate to substantial agreement. CONCLUSION: CEUS Nonradiation TRA 
      LI-RADS is a reliable tool for the detection of viable tumors in lesions treated 
      with TACE and demonstrates reproducibility across readers.

TI  - Predictive Factors for Adverse Event Outcomes After Transarterial 
      Radioembolization with Yttrium-90 Resin Microspheres in Europe: Results from the 
      Prospective Observational CIRT Study.
PG  - 852-867
LID - 10.1007/s00270-023-03391-4 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Using data collected in the prospective observational study CIRSE 
      Registry for SIR-Spheres Therapy, the present study aimed at identifying 
      predictors of adverse events (AEs) following transarterial radioembolization 
      (TARE) with Yttrium-90 resin microspheres for liver tumours. METHODS: We analysed 
      1027 patients enrolled between January 2015 and December 2017 and followed up for 
      24 months. Four hundred and twenty-two patients with hepatocellular carcinoma 
      (HCC), 120 with intrahepatic carcinoma (ICC), 237 with colorectal liver 
      metastases and 248 with liver metastases from other primaries were included. 
      Prognostic factors were calculated with a univariable analysis by using the 
      overall AEs burden score (AEBS). RESULTS: All-cause AEs were reported in 401/1027 
      (39.1%) patients, with AEs associated with TARE, such as abdominal pain (16.6%), 
      fatigue (17%), and nausea (11.7%) reported most frequently. Grade 3 or higher AEs 
      were reported in 92/1027 (9%) patients. Reports on grade ≥ 3 gastrointestinal 
      ulcerations (0.4%), gastritis (0.3%), radiation cholecystitis (0.2%) or 
      radioembolization-induced liver disease (0.5%) were uncommon. Univariable 
      analysis showed that in HCC, AEBS increased for Eastern Cooperative Oncology 
      Group (ECOG) 0 (p = 0.0045), 1 tumour nodule (0.0081),  > 1 TARE treatment 
      (p = 0.0224), no prophylactic embolization (p = 0.0211), partition model 
      dosimetry (p = 0.0007) and unilobar treatment target (0.0032). For ICC,  > 1 TARE 
      treatment was associated with an increase in AEBS (p = 0.0224), and for 
      colorectal liver metastases, ECOG 0 (p = 0.0188), > 2 prior systemic treatments 
      (p = 0.0127), and 1 tumour nodule (p = 0.0155) were associated with an increased 
      AEBS. CONCLUSION: Our study confirms that TARE is a safe treatment with low 
      toxicity and a minimal impact on quality of life.

TI  - Cost-Effectiveness Analysis of Camrelizumab Plus Rivoceranib Versus Sorafenib as 
      a First-Line Therapy for Unresectable Hepatocellular Carcinoma in the Chinese 
      Health Care System.
PG  - 149-162
LID - 10.1007/s40261-024-01343-5 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Camrelizumab plus rivoceranib showed significant 
      clinical benefits in progression-free survival and overall survival compared to 
      sorafenib in patients with unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). This 
      study aimed to assess its cost effectiveness from the perspective of Chinese 
      health care system. METHODS: A Markov state-transition model was developed based 
      on the Phase 3 randomized CARES-310 clinical trial data. Health state utility 
      values were obtained from the CARES-310 clinical trial, and direct medical costs 
      were derived from the relevant literature and local charges. The measured 
      outcomes included quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) and the incremental 
      cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER). Probabilistic and one-way sensitivity analyses 
      were performed to assess the uncertainty of the model. RESULTS: In the base-case 
      analysis, the incremental effectiveness and cost of camrelizumab plus rivoceranib 
      versus sorafenib were 0.41 QALYs and $13,684.84, respectively, resulting in an 
      ICER of $33,619.98/QALY, lower than the willingness-to-pay threshold of China 
      ($35,864.61/QALY). Subgroup analyses revealed that the ICERs of camrelizumab plus 
      rivoceranib versus sorafenib were $35,920.01 and $29,717.98 in patients with ALBI 
      grade 1 and grade 2, respectively. One-way sensitivity analyses indicated that 
      the cost of camrelizumab, the proportion of patients receiving subsequent 
      treatment in the camrelizumab plus rivoceranib group, and the cost of rivoceranib 
      were the most significant factors in the base-case analysis. Probabilistic 
      sensitivity analysis suggested that the probabilities of cost effectiveness of 
      camrelizumab plus rivoceranib were 61.27%, 51.46%, and 82.78% for any grade, and 
      ALBI grade 1 and grade 2, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Camrelizumab plus 
      rivoceranib was more cost effective than sorafenib as first-line therapy for 
      unresectable HCC in the Chinese setting.

TI  - Study protocol for FASTRAK: a randomised controlled trial evaluating the cost 
      impact and effectiveness of FAST-MRI for HCC suRveillance in pAtients with high 
      risK of liver cancer.

LID - e083701
AB  - INTRODUCTION: The surveillance of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) using 
      semi-annual liver ultrasound (US) is justified in patients with cirrhosis. In 
      this context, US has a low sensitivity (<30%) for the detection of HCC at the 
      very early stage (ie, Barcelona clinic liver cancer (BCLC) 0, uninodular tumour 
      <2 cm). The sensitivity of abbreviated liver MRI (AMRI) is reported to exceed 
      80%, but its use is hampered by costs and availability. Our hypothesis is that 
      AMRI used as a screening examination in patients at high risk of HCC (>3% per 
      year) could increase the rates of patients with a tumour detected at an early 
      stage accessible to curative-intent treatment, and demonstrate its 
      cost-effectiveness in this population. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: The FASTRAK trial is 
      a multicentre, randomised controlled trial with two parallel arms, aiming for 
      superiority and conducted on patients at high risk for HCC (yearly HCC incidence 
      >3%). Randomisation will be conducted on an individual basis with a centralised 
      approach and stratification by centre. After inclusion in the trial, each patient 
      will be randomly assigned to the experimental group (semi-annual US and AMRI) or 
      the control group (semi-annual US alone). The main objective is to assess the 
      cost/quality-adjusted life year and cost/patient detected with a BCLC 0 HCC in 
      both arms. A total of 944 patients will be recruited in 37 tertiary French 
      centres during a 36-month period and will be followed-up during 36 months. ETHICS 
      AND DISSEMINATION: The FASTRAK trial received ethical approval on 4 April 2022. 
      Results will be disseminated via publication in peer-reviewed journals as well as 
      presentation at international conferences. TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: Clinical 
      trial number (ClinicaTrials.gov) NCT05095714.

TI  - A randomized trial of mailed outreach with behavioral economic interventions to 
      improve liver cancer surveillance.
LID - 10.1097/HC9.0000000000000349 [doi]
LID - e0349
AB  - BACKGROUND: Surveillance rates for HCC remain limited in patients with cirrhosis. 
      We evaluated whether opt-out mailed outreach increased uptake with or without a 
      $20 unconditional incentive. METHODS: This was a pragmatic randomized controlled 
      trial in an urban academic health system including adult patients with cirrhosis 
      or advanced fibrosis, at least 1 visit to a specialty practice in the past 2 
      years and no surveillance in the last 7 months. Patients were randomized in a 
      1:2:2 ratio to (1) usual care, (2) a mailed letter with a signed order for an 
      ultrasound, or (3) a mailed letter with an order and a $20 unconditional 
      incentive. The main outcome was the proportion with completion of ultrasound 
      within 6 months. RESULTS: Among the 562 patients included, the mean age was 62.1 
      (SD 11.1); 56.8% were male, 51.1% had Medicare, and 40.6% were Black. At 6 
      months, 27.6% (95% CI: 19.5-35.7) completed ultrasound in the Usual care arm, 
      54.5% (95% CI: 47.9-61.0) in the Letter + Order arm, and 54.1% (95% CI: 
      47.5-60.6) in the Letter + Order + Incentive arm. There was a significant 
      increase in the Letter + Order arm compared to Usual care (absolute difference of 
      26.9%; 95% CI: 16.5-37.3; p<0.001), but no significant increase in the Letter + 
      Order + Incentive arm compared to Letter + Order (absolute difference of -0.4; 
      95% CI: -9.7 to 8.8; p=0.93). CONCLUSIONS: There was an increase in HCC 
      surveillance from mailed outreach with opt-out framing and a signed order slip, 
      but no increase in response to the financial incentive.

TI  - The utility of P-I-R classification in predicting the on-treatment histological 
      and clinical outcomes of patients with hepatitis B and advanced liver fibrosis.
PG  - 425-437
LID - 10.1097/HEP.0000000000000563 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: The predominantly progressive, indeterminate, and 
      predominantly regressive (P-I-R) classification extends beyond staging and 
      provides information on dynamic changes of liver fibrosis. However, the 
      prognostic implication of P-I-R classification is not elucidated. Therefore, in 
      the present research, we investigated the utility of P-I-R classification in 
      predicting the on-treatment clinical outcomes. APPROACH AND RESULTS: In an 
      extension study on a randomized controlled trial, we originally enrolled 1000 
      patients with chronic hepatitis B and biopsy-proven histological significant 
      fibrosis, and treated them for more than 7 years with entecavir-based therapy. 
      Among the 727 patients with a second biopsy at treatment week 72, we compared 
      P-I-R classification and Ishak score changes in 646 patients with adequate liver 
      sections for the histological evaluation. Progressive, indeterminate, and 
      regressive cases were observed in 70%, 17%, and 13% of patients before treatments 
      and 20%, 14%, and 64% after 72-week treatment, respectively, which could further 
      differentiate the histological outcomes of patients with stable Ishak scores. The 
      7-year cumulative incidence of HCC was 1.5% for the regressive cases, 4.3% for 
      the indeterminate cases, and 22.8% for the progressive cases ( p <0.001). After 
      adjusting for age, treatment regimen, platelet counts, cirrhosis, Ishak fibrosis 
      score changes, and Laennec staging, the posttreatment progressive had a HR of 
      17.77 (vs. posttreatment regressive; 95% CI: 5.55-56.88) for the incidence of 
      liver-related events (decompensation, HCC, and death/liver transplantation). 
      CONCLUSIONS: The P-I-R classification can be a meaningful complement to the Ishak 
      fibrosis score not only in evaluating the histological changes but also in 
      predicting the clinical outcomes.

AB  - To investigate the efficacy and safety of drug-eluting bead-transarterial 
      chemoembolization (DEB-TACE) combined with systemic chemotherapy in HR+/Her2- 
      locally advanced breast cancer (LABC) patients. A controlled study was conducted 
      on LABC patients treated at Jianyang People's Hospital and the First Affiliated 
      Hospital of Chengdu Medical College from December 2020 to June 2022. The patients 
      were randomly divided into the experimental group and the control group. The 
      experimental group received DEB-TACE combined with the TAC regimen (175 mg/m(2) 
      paclitaxel-loaded albumin, 50 mg/m(2) Doxorubicin, and 500 mg/m(2) 
      cyclophosphamide), while the control group received the TAC regimen 
      intravenously. The therapeutic efficacy was evaluated using the mRECIST criteria. 
      Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS 22.0 software, and baseline 
      characteristics, overall response rate (ORR), pathological complete response 
      (PCR), adverse reactions, and complications were compared between the two groups 
      using paired t-test and chi-square test. A total of 60 patients were included, 
      with 30 patients in the experimental group (50%) and 30 patients in the control 
      group (50%). After the first treatment, the ORR was 90% in the experimental group 
      and 60% in the control group (P < 0.05). The overall ORR was 100% in the 
      experimental group and 83% in the control group (P < 0.05). PCR was achieved in 
      14 patients (47%) in the experimental group and 4 patients (13%) in the control 
      group. The main adverse reactions in the experimental group were skin blistering, 
      pigmentation, and pain. There was no statistically significant difference in 
      vomiting and grade II or above bone marrow suppression between the two groups. No 
      grade III or above adverse events occurred in either group. The comparison of 
      tumor shrinkage between the two groups was P = 0.051, and axillary lymph node 
      shrinkage was P < 0.05. The use of drug-eluting beads in combination with 
      neoadjuvant chemotherapy is a feasible and safe treatment option for locally 
      advanced breast cancer patients.

AB  - This randomized, prospective, multicenter (12 centers in China) phase III trial 
      (Chinese Clinical Trial Registry #ChiCTR2000041170) compared drug-eluting bead 
      transarterial chemoembolization (DEB-TACE) combined with apatinib and DEB-TACE 
      monotherapy for patients with unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (uHCC). 
      Progression-free survival (PFS) was the primary endpoint. Overall survival (OS), 
      mRECIST-based objective response rates (ORR) and disease control rates (DCR), and 
      treatment-related adverse events (TRAEs) were secondary endpoints. Totally 243 
      cases were randomized, with 122 and 121 in the DEB-TACE + apatinib and DEB-TACE 
      groups, respectively. Cases administered DEB-TACE + apatinib displayed markedly 
      improved median PFS (7.1 months [95%CI 6.6-8.3] vs. 5.2 months [95%CI 5.0-5.9]) 
      and OS (23.3 months [95%CI 20.7-29.6] vs. 18.9 months [95%CI 17.9-20.1] compared 
      with those treated with DEB-TACE (both p < 0.001). Additionally, patients 
      administered DEB-TACE + apatinib had elevated ORR (56.6% vs. 38.8%) and DCR 
      (89.3% vs. 80.2%) versus the DEB-TACE group (both p < 0.001). Majority of TRAEs 
      were mild and manageable. Regarding DEB-TACE-related TRAEs, the rates of hepatic 
      artery thinning and spasms were elevated during the second DEB-TACE in cases 
      administered DEB-TACE + apatinib vs. DEB-TACE. The commonest apatinib-related 
      TRAEs in the DEB-TACE + apatinib group included hypertension, hand-foot syndrome, 
      fatigue, and diarrhea. In conclusion, DEB-TACE plus apatinib demonstrates 
      superior PFS versus DEB-TACE monotherapy in uHCC cases, maintaining a favorable 
      safety profile with similar occurrences of AEs.

TI  - Adjuvant holmium-166 radioembolization after radiofrequency ablation in 
      early-stage hepatocellular carcinoma patients: a dose-finding study (HORA EST HCC 
      trial).
PG  - 2085-2097
LID - 10.1007/s00259-024-06630-z [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to investigate the biodistribution of 
      (super-)selective trans-arterial radioembolization (TARE) with holmium-166 
      microspheres ((166)Ho-MS), when administered as adjuvant therapy after RFA of HCC 
      2-5 cm. The objective was to establish a treatment volume absorbed dose that 
      results in an absorbed dose of ≥ 120 Gy on the hyperemic zone around the ablation 
      necrosis (i.e., target volume). METHODS: In this multicenter, prospective 
      dose-escalation study in BCLC early stage HCC patients with lesions 2-5 cm, RFA 
      was followed by (super-)selective infusion of (166)Ho-MS on day 5-10 after RFA. 
      Dose distribution within the treatment volume was based on SPECT-CT. Cohorts of 
      up to 10 patients were treated with an incremental dose (60 Gy, 90 Gy, 120 Gy) of 
      (166)Ho-MS to the treatment volume. The primary endpoint was to obtain a target 
      volume dose of ≥ 120 Gy in 9/10 patients within a cohort. RESULTS: Twelve 
      patients were treated (male 10; median age, 66.5 years (IQR, [64.3-71.7])) with a 
      median tumor diameter of 2.7 cm (IQR, [2.1-4.0]). At a treatment volume absorbed 
      dose of 90 Gy, the primary endpoint was met with a median absorbed target volume 
      dose of 138 Gy (IQR, [127-145]). No local recurrences were found within 1-year 
      follow-up. CONCLUSION: Adjuvant (super-)selective infusion of (166)Ho-MS after 
      RFA for the treatment of HCC can be administered safely at a dose of 90 Gy to the 
      treatment volume while reaching a dose of ≥ 120 Gy to the target volume and may 
      be a favorable adjuvant therapy for HCC lesions 2-5 cm. TRIAL REGISTRATION: 
      Clinicaltrials.gov NCT03437382 . (registered: 19-02-2018).

TI  - Selective internal radiation therapy for unresectable HCC: The SIRT downstaging 
      study.
LID - 10.1097/HC9.0000000000000475 [doi]
LID - e0475
AB  - BACKGROUND: Selective internal radiation therapy (SIRT) is recommended as a 
      downstaging (DS) strategy for solitary unresectable HCC <8 cm. The aim of this 
      study was to report the results of acquired experience in a tertiary center for 
      all unresectable HCCs. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective, observational study 
      using data collected from consecutive patients undergoing SIRT between October 
      2013 and June 2020. DS was considered achieved when a curative treatment could be 
      proposed 6 months after SIRT. RESULTS: One hundred twenty-seven patients were 
      included (male = 90%, 64 ± 11 y), of whom 112 (n = 88%) had cirrhosis. HCC was 
      classified as BCLC stage C in 64 patients (50%), with a median diameter of 61 mm, 
      an infiltrative pattern in 51 patients (40%), and portal vein invasion in 62 
      (49%) patients. Fifty patients (39%) achieved DS 6 months following SIRT, with 29 
      of them (23%) undergoing curative treatment in a median time of 4.3 months: 17 
      (13%) were transplanted, 11 (85%) had liver resection, and 1 patient had a 
      radiofrequency ablation. The median overall survival of patients with or without 
      DS was 51 versus 10 months, respectively (p < 0.001). In patients who achieved 
      DS, progression-free survival was higher in patients who underwent surgery: 47 
      versus 11 months (p < 0.001). Four variables were independently associated with 
      DS: age (OR: 0.96, 95% CI: [0.92, 0.99]; p = 0.032), baseline α-fetoprotein (OR: 
      1.00, 95% CI: [1.00, 1.00]; p = 0.034), HCC distribution (OR: 0.3, 95% CI: [0.11, 
      0.75]; p = 0.012), and ALBI grade (OR: 0.34. 95% CI: [0.14, 0.80]; p = 0.014). 
      CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that SIRT in patients with unresectable HCC 
      could be an effective treatment: DS was achieved for around 39% of the patients 
      and more than half of these then underwent curative treatment.

TI  - Blood flow restriction Exercise in the perioperative setting to Prevent loss of 
      muscle mass in patients with pancreatic, biliary tract, and liver cancer: study 
      protocol for the PREV-Ex randomized controlled trial.
PG  - 356
LID - 10.1186/s13063-024-08207-5 [doi]
LID - 356
AB  - BACKGROUND: Patients diagnosed with pancreatic, biliary tract, and liver cancer 
      often suffer from a progressive loss of muscle mass. Given the considerable 
      functional impairments in these patients, high musculoskeletal weight loads may 
      not be well tolerated by all individuals. The use of blood-flow restricted 
      resistance training (BFR-T) which only requires low training loads may allow for 
      a faster recovery of muscle due to avoidance of high levels of mechanical muscle 
      stress associated with high-load resistance exercise. This study aims to 
      investigate whether BFR-T can prevent or slow down the loss of skeletal muscle 
      mass and enhance the functional capacity and mental health of patients with 
      pancreatic, biliary tract, and liver cancer. METHODS: The PREV-Ex exercise trial 
      is a multicenter two-armed randomized controlled trial. Patients will be 
      randomized to an exercise program consisting of home-based low-load BFR-T during 
      a combined pre- and postoperative period for a total of 6-10 weeks 
      (prehabilitation and rehabilitation), or to a control group. Protein 
      supplementation will be given to both groups to ensure adequate protein intake. 
      The primary outcomes, skeletal muscle thickness and muscle cross-sectional area, 
      will be assessed by ultrasound. Secondary outcomes include the following: (i) 
      muscle catabolism-related and inflammatory bio-markers (molecular characteristics 
      will be assessed from a vastus lateralis biopsy and blood samples will be 
      obtained from a sub-sample of patients); (ii) patient-reported outcome measures 
      (self-reported fatigue, health-related quality of life, and nutritional status 
      will be assessed through validated questionnaires); (iii) physical 
      fitness/performance/activity (validated tests will be used to evaluate physical 
      function, cardiorespiratory fitness and maximal isometric muscle strength. 
      Physical activity and sedentary behavior (assessed using an activity monitor); 
      (iv) clinical outcomes: hospitalization rates and blood status will be recorded 
      from the patients' medical records; (v) explorative outcomes of patients' 
      experience of the exercise program which will be evaluated using focus 
      group/individual interviews. DISCUSSION: It is worthwhile to investigate new 
      strategies that have the potential to counteract the deterioration of skeletal 
      muscle mass, muscle function, strength, and physical function, all of which have 
      debilitating consequences for patients with pancreatic, biliary tract, and liver 
      cancer. The expected findings could improve prognosis, help patients stay 
      independent for longer, and possibly reduce treatment-related costs. TRIAL

AB  - This is the phase Ib part of the phase I/II CAMILLA trial evaluating cabozantinib 
      plus durvalumab in advanced chemo-refractory proficient mismatch repair or 
      microsatellite stable (pMMR/MSS) gastrointestinal malignancies including 
      gastric/gastroesophageal junction/esophageal (G/GEJ/E) adenocarcinoma, colorectal 
      cancer (CRC), and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Thirty-five patients are 
      enrolled. There are no observed dose-limiting toxicities during dose escalation. 
      The overall grade 3/4 treatment-related adverse event rate is 34%. Among 
      evaluable patients (n = 30), the objective response rate (ORR) is 30%, disease 
      control rate (DCR) 83.3%, 6-month progression-free survival (PFS) 36.7%, median 
      PFS 4.5 months, and median overall survival (OS) 8.7 months. Responses are seen 
      in 4 of 17, 3 of 10, and 2 of 3 patients with CRC, G/GEJ/E adenocarcinoma, and 
      HCC, respectively. Participants with a PD-L1 combined positive score (CPS) ≥5 
      have numerically higher ORR, PFS, and OS. Cabozantinib plus durvalumab 
      demonstrates a tolerable safety profile and potential efficacy in previously 
      treated advanced pMMR/MSS gastrointestinal malignancies.

TI  - Comparing the accuracy of prediction models to detect clinically relevant 
      post-hepatectomy liver failure early after major hepatectomy.
LID - 10.1093/bjs/znad433 [doi]
LID - znad433
AB  - BACKGROUND: Arterial lactate measurements were recently suggested as an early 
      predictor of clinically relevant post-hepatectomy liver failure (PHLF). This 
      needed to be evaluated in the subgroup of major hepatectomies only. METHOD: This 
      observational cohort study included consecutive elective major hepatectomies at 
      Karolinska University Hospital from 2010 to 2018. Clinical risk factors for PHLF, 
      perioperative arterial lactate measurements and routine lab values were included 
      in uni- and multivariable regression analysis. Receiver operating characteristics 
      and risk cut-offs were calculated. RESULTS: In total, 649 patients constituted 
      the study cohort, of which 92 developed PHLF grade B/C according to the 
      International Study Group of Liver Surgery (ISGLS). Lactate reached significantly 
      higher intra- and postoperative levels in PHLF grades B and C compared to grade A 
      or no liver failure (all P < 0.002). Lactate on postoperative day (POD) 1 was 
      superior to earlier measurement time points in predicting PHLF B/C (AUC 0.75), 
      but was outperformed by both clinical risk factors (AUC 0.81, P = 0.031) and 
      bilirubin POD1 (AUC 0.83, P = 0.013). A multivariable logistic regression model 
      including clinical risk factors and bilirubin POD1 had the highest AUC of 0.87 (P 
      = 0.006), with 56.6% sensitivity and 94.7% specificity for PHLF grade B/C 
      (cut-off ≥0.32). The model identified 46.7% of patients with 90-day mortality and 
      had an equally good discriminatory potential for mortality as the established 
      ISGLS criteria for PHLF grade B/C but could be applied already on POD1. 
      CONCLUSION: The potential of lactate to predict PHLF following major hepatectomy 
      was inferior to a prediction model consisting of clinical risk factors and 
      bilirubin on first post-operative day.

TI  - Von Willebrand Factor Antigen Improves Risk Stratification for Patients with a 
      Diagnosis of Resectable Hepatocellular Carcinoma.
PG  - 6526-6536
LID - 10.1245/s10434-024-15618-w [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Posthepatectomy liver failure (PHLF), complications of portal 
      hypertension, and disease recurrence determine the outcome for hepatocellular 
      carcinoma (HCC) patients undergoing liver resection. This study aimed to evaluate 
      the von Willebrand factor antigen (vWF-Ag) as a non-invasive test for clinically 
      significant portal hypertension (CSPH) and a predictive biomarker for time to 
      recurrence (TTR) and overall survival (OS). METHODS: The study recruited 72 HCC 
      patients with detailed preoperative workup from a prospective trial (NCT02118545) 
      and followed for complications, TTR, and OS. Additionally, 163 compensated 
      patients with resectable HCC were recruited to evaluate vWF-Ag cutoffs for ruling 
      out or ruling in CSPH. Finally, vWF-Ag cutoffs were prospectively evaluated in an 
      external validation cohort of 34 HCC patients undergoing liver resection. 
      RESULTS: In receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analyses, vWF-Ag (area under 
      the curve [AUC], 0.828) was similarly predictive of PHLF as indocyanine green 
      clearance (disappearance rate: AUC, 0.880; retention rate: AUC, 0.894), whereas 
      computation of future liver remnant was inferior (AUC, 0.756). Cox-regression 
      showed an association of vWF-Ag with TTR (per 10%: hazard ratio [HR], 1.056; 95% 
      confidence interval [CI] 1.017-1.097) and OS (per 10%: HR, 1.067; 95% CI 
      1.022-1.113). In the analyses, VWF-Ag yielded an AUC of 0.824 for diagnosing 
      CSPH, with a vWF-Ag of 182% or lower ruling out and higher than 291% ruling in 
      CSPH. Therefore, a highest-risk group (> 291%, 9.7% of patients) with a 57.1% 
      incidence of PHLF was identified, whereas no patient with a vWF-Ag of 182% or 
      lower (52.7%) experienced PHLF. The predictive value of vWF-Ag for PHLF and OS 
      was externally validated. CONCLUSION: For patients with resectable HCC, VWF-Ag 
      allows for simplified preoperative risk stratification. Patients with vWF-Ag 
      levels higher than 291% might be considered for alternative treatments, whereas 
      vWF-Ag levels of 182% or lower identify patients best suited for surgery.

TI  - High-risk population of progressive hepatic fibrosis in chronic hepatitis B 
      patients on antiviral therapy.
PG  - 481-493
LID - 10.1007/s00535-023-01970-3 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Progressive hepatic fibrosis leads to hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) 
      and decompensated cirrhosis. The aim of this study was to identify the high-risk 
      population for progressive hepatic fibrosis and the incidence of HCC and 
      decompensated cirrhosis in chronic hepatitis B (CHB) patients with antiviral 
      therapy. METHODS: The data came from a multicenter, center-randomized, 
      double-blind clinical trial that analyzed only patients in the ETV-treated arm. 
      There was 156 hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg)-positive and 135 HBeAg-negative 
      patients in 14 institutions. The primary endpoint was fibrosis reversal on 
      72-week Entecavir (ETV) treatment. The 7-year cumulative incidence of HCC and 
      decompensated cirrhosis were analyzed. Multivariate logistic and LASSO regression 
      analyses were used to screen variables associated with fibrosis reversal. 
      RESULTS: 86/156 (55%) HBeAg-positive and 58/135 (43%) HBeAg-negative patients 
      achieved fibrosis reversal on 72-week ETV treatment. Average age was 43 years, 
      203 (69.8%) was male, and 144 (49.5%) patients had cirrhosis. Age ≥ 40 years (OR: 
      0.46, 95% CI 0.23-0.93) and HBcrAg ≥ 8.23 log U/ml (OR: 2.72, 95% CI 1.33-5.54) 
      in HBeAg-positive patients and HBV genotype C (OR: 0.44, 95% CI 0.21-0.97) in 
      HBeAg-negative patients were independent factors of fibrosis reversal. It was 
      confirmed in patients with cirrhosis. After 7-year ETV treatment, seven (4.5%) 
      HBeAg-positive patients occurred HCC or decompensated cirrhosis, including four 
      patients with age ≥ 40 years and six with HBcrAg 8.23log U/ml, while twelve 
      (8.9%) HBeAg-negative patients occurred, including eleven with HBV genotype C. 
      CONCLUSIONS: HBeAg-positive patients with a low HBcrAg level or old age, and 
      HBeAg-negative patients with HBV genotype C tended to develop progressive hepatic 
      fibrosis and had a high incidence of HCC and decompensated cirrhosis, even on ETV 
      treatment.

TI  - Community-Level Factors Associated with Hepatocellular Carcinoma Incidence and 
      Mortality: An Observational Registry Study.
PG  - 270-278
LID - 10.1158/1055-9965.EPI-23-0902 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) incidence and outcomes vary across 
      populations in the United States, but few studies evaluate local drivers of 
      observed disparities. We measured HCC incidence at the community level and 
      assessed community-level HCC risk factors with the goal of informing resource 
      allocation to improve early case detection, which is associated with improved 
      outcomes. METHODS: Clinical and demographic data including census tract of 
      residence for all adults diagnosed with HCC in the Connecticut Tumor Registry 
      between 2008 and 2019 were combined with publicly available U.S. Census and 
      Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) data at the ZIP Code tabulation 
      area (ZCTA) level. The average annual incidence of HCC was calculated for each 
      ZCTA and associations between community-level characteristics, HCC incidence, 
      stage at diagnosis, and survival were evaluated. RESULTS: Average annual HCC 
      incidence during the study period was 8.9/100,000 adults and varied from 0 to 
      97.7 per 100,000 adults by ZCTA. At the community level, lower rates of high 
      school graduation, higher rates of poverty, and rural community type were 
      associated with higher HCC incidence. Persons with HCC living in the highest 
      incidence ZCTAs were diagnosed at a younger age and were less likely to be alive 
      at 1, 2, and 5 years after diagnosis. CONCLUSIONS: Community-level socioeconomic 
      factors are strongly associated with HCC incidence and survival in Connecticut. 
      IMPACT: This reproducible geo-localization approach using cancer registry, 
      Census, and CDC data can be used to identify communities most likely to benefit 
      from health system investments to reduce disparities in HCC.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Both Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy (SBRT) and Trans-arterial 
      Chemoembolization (TACE) are now being widely used to treat advanced 
      hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and can improve tumor local control rates. We 
      aimed at evaluating the efficacy and toxicity of combining SBRT and TACE in 
      comparison to TACE alone in unresectable HCC. METHODS: 42 unresectable Barcelona 
      Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC) stage B HCC Child Pugh (CP) A patients were randomized 
      to receive either: TACE alone (Arm A) or TACE followed by SBRT (Arm B). Dose 
      prescribed was 40Gy in 5consecutive daily fractions over 1 week . We compared the 
      local control (LC), Progression free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS) and 
      toxicity between the two arms. RESULTS: 22 patients were in arm A versus 20 
      patients in arm B with median follow up 20 months starting recruitment from April 
      2021 till January 2023. Both LC, PFS were significantly better in Arm B. Complete 
      remission (CR) rate was 54.5% and 75% in Arm A and B, respectively. Median PFS 
      was 16 months in Arm B compared to 11 months in Arm A (p =0.003). Median OS was 
      not reached in both arms. Both arms had comparable toxicities. CONCLUSION: Adding 
      SBRT to TACE in advanced HCC, is safe and feasible with better efficacy in terms 
      of LC and PFS with comparable side effects, in comparison to TACE alone.

TI  - Combined hepatocellular cholangiocarcinoma in hepatectomy specimens: A 
      clinicopathologic analysis.
PG  - 744-750
LID - 10.4103/ijpm.ijpm_357_22 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Combined hepatocellular-cholangiocarcinoma (cHCC-CCA) is an uncommon 
      form of primary liver carcinoma. It is heterogenous in terms of morphology, 
      immunohistochemistry, radiology, and clinical features; making it a challenging 
      entity for diagnosis. AIMS: The purpose of the present study was to evaluate 
      clinicopathological characteristics of patients with cHCC-CCA. SETTINGS AND 
      DESIGN: Retrospective observational study. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The patients 
      diagnosed with cHCC-CC were identified from hepatic surgical specimens and were 
      evaluated. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: Survival was estimated as per Kaplan-Meier 
      method. RESULTS: Out of six patients, five had undergone resection while one had 
      liver transplant. Five were male and one was female and the mean age was 52 
      years. Tumor markers revealed raised serum alfa-fetoprotein and CA19.9 in four 
      and three patients, respectively. Five of the liver specimens were cirrhotic. 
      Diagnosis was predominantly based on tumor morphology. All cases were of Allen 
      and Lisa type B and cHCC-CCA as per WHO (2019) classification. Stem cell features 
      <5% were noted in two cases. Immunohistochemistry for programmed death 
      1/programmed death ligand 1 (PD1/PDL1) was negative in both the hepatocellular 
      and cholangiocellular components in all six cases. Mismatch repair (MMR) protein 
      expression was retained in two and deficient in four cases. The median follow-up 
      after surgery was 21.3 months (range, 5-46.2 months). Five patients had 
      intrahepatic and/or extrahepatic recurrence on follow-up after surgery. The 
      median recurrence-free survival was estimated at 13.1 months (95% CI 5.67-20.6). 
      Three patients had received salvage treatment. The median overall survival was 
      estimated at 20 months (95% CI 0-45.3). CONCLUSIONS: The present study highlights 
      the role of morphology in the diagnosis of cHCC-CCA. The choice of locoregional 
      and/or systemic therapy after surgery may be individualized based on the 
      clinicopathological characteristics.

TI  - First-in-human Phase I Trial of TPST-1120, an Inhibitor of PPARα, as Monotherapy 
      or in Combination with Nivolumab, in Patients with Advanced Solid Tumors.
PG  - 1100-1110
LID - 10.1158/2767-9764.CRC-24-0082 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: TPST-1120 is a first-in-class oral inhibitor of peroxisome 
      proliferator-activated receptor α (PPARα), a fatty acid ligand-activated 
      transcription factor that regulates genes involved in fatty acid oxidation, 
      angiogenesis, and inflammation, and is a novel target for cancer therapy. 
      TPST-1120 displayed antitumor activity in xenograft models and synergistic tumor 
      reduction in syngeneic tumor models when combined with anti-PD-1 agents. 
      EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: This phase I, open-label, dose-escalation study 
      (NCT03829436) evaluated TPST-1120 as monotherapy in patients with advanced solid 
      tumors and in combination with nivolumab in patients with renal cell carcinoma 
      (RCC), cholangiocarcinoma (CCA), or hepatocellular carcinoma. Objectives included 
      evaluation of safety, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and preliminary 
      antitumor activity (RECIST v1.1). RESULTS: A total of 39 patients enrolled with 
      38 treated (20 monotherapy, 18 combination; median 3 prior lines of therapy). The 
      most common treatment-related adverse events (TRAE) were grade 1-2 nausea, 
      fatigue, and diarrhea. No grade 4-5 TRAEs or dose-limiting toxicities were 
      reported. In the monotherapy group, 53% (10/19) of evaluable patients had a best 
      objective response of stable disease. In the combination group, 3 patients had 
      partial responses, for an objective response rate of 20% (3/15) across all doses 
      and 30% (3/10) at TPST-1120 ≥400 mg twice daily. Responses occurred in 2 patients 
      with RCC, both of whom had previously progressed on anti-PD-1 therapy, and 1 
      patient with late-line CCA. CONCLUSIONS: TPST-1120 was well tolerated as 
      monotherapy and in combination with nivolumab and the combination showed 
      preliminary evidence of clinical activity in PD-1 inhibitor refractory and immune 
      compromised cancers. SIGNIFICANCE: TPST-1120 is a first-in-class oral inhibitor 
      of PPARα, whose roles in metabolic and immune regulation are implicated in tumor 
      proliferation/survival and inhibition of anticancer immunity. This first-in-human 
      study of TPST-1120 alone and in combination with nivolumab supports 
      proof-of-concept of PPARα inhibition as a target of therapeutic intervention in 
      solid tumors.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to investigate the safety and efficacy of 
      precision hepatectomy in the treatment of primary liver cancer. METHODS: An 
      randomized controlled trial of 98 patients with primary liver cancer admitted to 
      our hospital from February 2020 to February 2021 were analyzed for the study, and 
      they were divided into 49 cases each in the control group (conventional 
      hepatectomy) and the study group (precision hepatectomy) according to the 
      different surgical methods. The surgical condition, complications and follow-up 
      results of the two groups were counted, and the liver function and immune 
      function of the two groups were observed before and 1 week after surgery. 
      RESULTS: The operation time, intraoperative bleeding, hospitalization time and 
      anal venting time in the study group were less than those in the control group 
      (P < 0.05). One week after surgery, AST, TBiL, ALT and ALB levels decreased, with 
      in the study group significantly higher than those in the control group 
      (P < 0.05); CD4+, CD3 + and CD4+/CD8 + levels were significantly higher in the 
      study group (P < 0.05). The incidence of complications in the study group was 
      significantly lower than that in the control group (P < 0.05). After 2 years of 
      follow-up, the recurrence rate and mortality rate of the study group were lower 
      than those of the control group (P < 0.05); the difference was not statistically 
      significant when comparing the metastasis rate between the two groups (P > 0.05). 
      CONCLUSION: Precision hepatectomy can effectively treat primary liver cancer with 
      high safety and could be promoted in clinical practice.

TI  - PETAL protocol: a phase Ib study of pembrolizumab after transarterial 
      chemoembolization in hepatocellular carcinoma.
PG  - 499-507
LID - 10.2217/fon-2022-0916 [doi]
AB  - Transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) is the treatment of choice for 
      intermediate-stage hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Recent data suggest that TACE 
      may boost the efficacy of anti-PD-1 immunotherapy. The authors present the trial 
      protocol for PETAL, a phase Ib study, which will assess the safety and 
      bioactivity of pembrolizumab, an anti-PD-1 antibody, following TACE in HCC. After 
      a run-in phase evaluating six patients to establish preliminary safety, up to 26 
      additional participants will be enrolled. Pembrolizumab will be administered 
      three-times weekly for 1 year or until progression, starting 30-45 days after 
      TACE. The primary objective is to determine safety and the secondary objective is 
      to preliminarily evaluate efficacy. Radiological responses will be evaluated 
      every four cycles. Clinical Trial Registration: NCT03397654 (ClinicalTrials.gov).

TI  - Resin-Based 90 Y Tumor Dose as a Predictor of Duration of Response and Survival 
      in Patients With Surgically Unresectable Hepatocellular Carcinoma : A Prospective 
      Single-Arm Study.
PG  - 799-805
LID - 10.1097/RLU.0000000000005198 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Personalized dosimetry improves overall survival (OS) in patients 
      with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) treated with glass 90 Y radioembolization. 
      This study evaluated personalized tumor dose (TD) as a predictor of OS, 
      progression-free survival (PFS), and local duration of response (DOR) in patients 
      with surgically unresectable HCC treated with resin 90 Y radioembolization. 
      PATIENTS AND METHODS: This prospective, single-center, single-arm clinical trial 
      (NCT04172714) evaluated the efficacy of scout activity of resin 90 Y versus 99m 
      Tc-MAA for treatment planning. A secondary aim of this study was to evaluate 
      personalized dosimetry as a predictor of OS, PFS, and DOR. Partition dosimetry 
      model was utilized for nonsegmental therapies with targeted TD >200 Gy and 
      nontumoral liver dose <70 Gy. Single compartment dose of 200 Gy was used for 
      segmentectomies. OS, PFS, and local DOR from 90 Y was estimated using 
      Kaplan-Meier estimation with log-rank analysis used to determine predictors of 
      prolonged survival. FINDINGS: Thirty patients with treatment-naive HCC and 33 
      tumors (19 segmental and 14 nonsegmental) were included. Overall, 18 patients 
      underwent segmental Y90-RE and 12 underwent non-segmental/lobar therapies. The 
      mean 90 Y TD was 493 Gy. The median follow-up since enrollment into the study was 
      37 months. The mean OS was 32.2 months for the entire cohort. A total of 5 
      patients underwent orthotopic liver transplantation post 90 Y and were excluded 
      from further survival analysis. The mean OS for the remainder of the cohort was 
      30.1 months (median not reached). The mean TD >250 Gy resulted in prolonged mean 
      OS and PFS. The median local DOR was 32.7 months with mean TD 330 Gy predicting 
      prolonged DOR. INTERPRETATION: For patients with surgically unresectable HCC 
      treated with resin 90 Y, there is mean TD threshold predicting prolonged OS, PFS, 
      and local DOR. Therefore, there should be further emphasis on personalized 
      dosimetry for optimization of patient outcomes.

AB  - Salmonella enterica is a zoonotic bacterium that not only causes serious economic 
      losses to the livestock and poultry industries but also seriously endangers human 
      health. Long-term indiscriminate use of antibiotics has led to drug resistance in 
      Salmonella, and thus the identification of alternatives to antibiotics is 
      crucial. In this study, the effects of puerarin on the S. enterica-infected 
      chickens were investigated. A total of 360 chicks were randomly assigned as the 
      control group (CON), the S. enterica group (S), and puerarin-treatment group (P). 
      Chicks in the P group were fed the basal diet supplemented with 50 (P50), 100 
      (P100), 200 (P200), and 400 (P400) mg/kg puerarin, respectively. It was found 
      that puerarin treatment markedly altered the serum activities of aspartate 
      aminotransferase (AST), alanine transaminase (ALT), and superoxide dismutase 
      (SOD), together with the malondialdehyde (MDA) and total antioxidant capacity 
      (T-AOC) contents in the serum. The mRNA expression of IL-6, IL-1β, TNF-α, Bcl-2, 
      and caspase-8 in the livers of S. enterica-infected chicks was increased after 
      infection but significantly reduced after treatment with puerarin. Histologic 
      analysis showed that puerarin effectively mitigated morphological damage in the 
      liver caused by S. enterica. Proteomic analysis revealed that S. enterica 
      infection led to metabolic disorders in the liver, resulting in oxidative stress, 
      increased inflammation, and significantly elevated levels of hepatocellular 
      carcinoma biomarkers. The findings of the filtered sequencing were verified by 
      using quantitative PCR (qPCR). Treatment with 100 mg/mL puerarin thus effectively 
      alleviated disordered liver metabolism, reduced inflammation and oxidative damage 
      and significantly reduced the levels of hepatocellular carcinoma biomarkers in 
      the liver. The results suggest that puerarin has the potential to replace 
      antibiotics to control Salmonella infection in poultry and thus improve food 
      safety.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the association between acromegaly and cancer and 
      different types of cancer by using natural language processing systems and big 
      data analytics. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We conducted an observational, 
      retrospective study utilizing data from the electronic health records (EHRs) of 
      Hospital Universitario Puerta de Hierro Majadahonda, Madrid, Spain. Information 
      from the EHRs was extracted using artificial intelligence techniques and analyzed 
      using Savana Manager 4.0 software. RESULTS: Out of a total of 708,047 registered 
      patients (54.7% females), 544 patients (0.08%; 330 women, 60.7%; mean age at 
      diagnosis 53.0±15.8 yr) were diagnosed with acromegaly. The incidence of cancer 
      was higher in patients with acromegaly vs those without this condition (7.7% vs 
      3.9%, p<0.001; OR, 2.047, 95%CI, 1.493-2.804). Male acromegalic patients had a 
      higher prevalence of cancer vs females (57.1% vs 42.9%, p=0.012). A significantly 
      higher prevalence of colorectal cancer (2.9% vs 1.4%, p=0.006), bladder cancer 
      (1.1% vs 0.3%, p=0.005), and lymphoma (1.1% vs 0.3%, p=0.009) was observed in 
      patients with acromegaly vs those without the condition. Acromegalic men had 
      significantly higher prevalence rates of colorectal cancer (4.7% vs 1.3%, 
      p=0.001), bladder cancer (2.8% vs 0.4%, p<0.001), breast cancer (0.9% vs 0.2%, 
      p=0.042), gastric cancer (0.9% vs 0.1%, p=0.011), lymphoma (1.4% vs 0.3%, 
      p=0.037), and liver cancer (0.9% vs 0.1%, p=0.012) vs non-acromegalic men. On the 
      other hand, acromegalic women showed a higher prevalence of thyroid cancer (1.2% 
      vs 0.4%, p=0.043) vs non-acromegalic women. CONCLUSION: Our study, based on 
      artificial intelligence techniques and analysis of real-world data and 
      information, revealed a significant association between acromegaly and cancer in 
      our hospital population, mainly acromegalic men, with a higher frequency of 
      colorectal cancer, bladder cancer and lymphoma in particular.

AB  - INTRODUCTION AND OBJECTIVES: Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) represents one of the 
      most common cancers worldwide. A considerable proportion of HCC is caused by 
      cirrhosis related to metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH). Due 
      to the increasing prevalence of metabolic syndrome, it is estimated that 
      MASH-related HCC will become the most prevalent etiology of HCC. Currently, HCC 
      screening is based on liver ultrasonography; however, the sensitivity of 
      ultrasonography for early HCC stages in obese patients only reaches 23 %. To 
      date, no studied biomarker shows sufficient efficacy for screening purposes. 
      Nevertheless, the usage of spectroscopic methods offers a new perspective, as its 
      potential use would provide cheap, fast analysis of samples such as blood plasma. 
      MATERIAL AND METHODS: We employed a combination of conventional and chiroptical 
      spectroscopic methods to study differences between the blood plasma of obese 
      cirrhotic patients with and without HCC. We included 20 subjects with HCC and 17 
      without evidence of liver cancer, all of them with body mass index ≥ 30. RESULTS: 
      Sensitivities and specificities reached values as follows: 0.780 and 0.905 for 
      infrared spectroscopy, 0.700 and 0.767 for Raman spectroscopy, 0.840 and 0.743 
      for electronic circular dichroism, and 0.805 and 0.923 for Raman optical 
      activity. The final combined classification model based on all spectroscopic 
      methods reached a sensitivity of 0.810 and a specificity of 0.857, with the 
      highest area under the receiver operating characteristic curve among all models 
      (0.961). CONCLUSIONS: We suggest that this approach can be used effectively as a 
      diagnostic tool in patients who are not examinable by liver ultrasonography.

AB  - The effectiveness and risks of anticoagulant therapy in cirrhotic patients with 
      non-symptomatic portal vein thrombosis (PVT) remain unclear. We conducted a 
      multicenter, Zelen-designed randomized controlled trial to determine the 
      effectiveness of warfarin in cirrhotic patients with non-symptomatic PVT during a 
      one-year follow-up. In brief, 64 patients were 1:1 randomly divided into the 
      anticoagulation group or the untreated group. The probability of recanalization 
      was significantly higher in the anticoagulation group than those untreated in 
      both ITT analysis (71.9% vs 34.4%, p = 0.004) and PP analysis (76.7% vs 32.4%, 
      p < 0.001). Anticoagulation treatment was the independent predictor of 
      recanalization (HR 2.776, 95%CI 1.307-5.893, p = 0.008). The risk of bleeding 
      events and mortality were not significantly different. A significantly higher 
      incidence of ascites aggravation was observed in the untreated group (3.3% vs

      as an anticoagulation therapy for treating non-symptomatic PVT in cirrhotic

AB  - PURPOSE: Primary tumour resection (PTR) is still a selection for patients with 
      low tumour burden and good condition, especially with conversion therapy purpose 
      for colorectal liver-limited metastases (CRLMs). The objective was to evaluate 
      whether pre-PTR chemotherapy could improve progression-free survival (PFS) for 
      patients with asymptomatic synchronous unresectable CRLMs. PATIENTS AND METHODS: 
      Patients with asymptomatic synchronous unresectable CRLMs were randomly assigned 
      to receive pre-PTR chemotherapy (arm A) or upfront PTR (arm B). Chemotherapy 
      regimens of mFOLFOX6 plus cetuximab, mFOLFOX6 plus bevacizumab or mFOLFOX6 alone 
      were chosen according to the RAS genotype. The primary end-point was PFS; 
      secondary end-points included overall survival (OS), tumour response, disease 
      control rate (DCR), liver metastases resection rate, surgical complications and 
      chemotherapy toxicity. RESULTS: Three hundred and twenty patients were randomly 
      assigned to arm A (160 patients) and arm B (160 patients). Patients in arm A had 
      significantly improved the median PFS compared with arm B (10.5 versus 9.1 
      months; P = 0.013). Patients in arm A also had significantly better DCR (84.4% 
      versus 75.0%; P = 0.037). The median OS (29.4 versus 27.2 months; P = 0.058), 
      objective response rate (ORR) (53.1% versus 45.0%; P = 0.146) and liver 
      metastases resection rate (21.9% versus 18.1%; P = 0.402) were not significantly 
      different. The Clavien-Dindo 3-4 complications post PTR (4.5% versus 3.8%, 
      P = 0.759) and the incidence of grade 3/4 chemotherapy events (42.2% versus 
      40.4%, P = 0.744) reached no statistical significance. CONCLUSIONS: For 
      asymptomatic synchronous unresectable CRLMs, Pre-PTR chemotherapy improved the 
      PFS compared with upfront PTR.

TI  - The pharmacokinetics and safety of lidocaine in liver cancer patients undergoing 
      hepatic resection.
PG  - 829-839
LID - 10.1007/s00228-023-03498-0 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to explore the pharmacokinetics (PK) 
      characteristics and safety of continuous lidocaine infusion during hepatectomy in 
      liver cancer patients. METHODS: This study included thirty-five patients 
      undergoing laparoscopic hepatectomy from January 2021 to December 2021. Patients 
      received a short infusion of 1% lidocaine at a dose of 1.5 mg/kg based on ideal 
      body weight, followed by a continuous infusion of 1 mg/kg/h during the operation. 
      The plasma concentrations of lidocaine and its active metabolites were measured 
      using validated ultra-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. 
      Safety was evaluated by monitoring and recording all adverse events (AEs). 
      RESULTS: The concentrations of lidocaine were within the safe range, except one 
      patient's concentration of lidocaine which reached the toxic range (> 5 μg/mL). 
      The mean half-life (T(1/2)), the mean time to maximum observed concentration 
      (T(max)), and the mean maximum observed concentration (C(max)) of lidocaine were 
      3.96 h, 2.85 h, and 2030 ng/mL, respectively; the mean T(1/2), T(max), and C(max) 
      (n = 32) of MEGX were 6.59 h, 5.05 h, and 333.28 ng/mL, respectively; and the 
      mean T(1/2), T(max), and C(max) of GX (n = 18) were 25.98 h, 7.33 h, and 
      75.81 ng/mL. Although eight subjects with AEs were reported, there were no 
      serious AEs or deaths. No patients had serious postoperative complications. No 
      deaths occurred within 30 days after the operation. CONCLUSIONS: Under the 
      administration regimen of this study, intravenous infusion of lidocaine is safe 
      and tolerable for liver cancer patients with laparoscopic hepatectomy. Fine 
      safety and PK characteristics support the application of lidocaine in such 
      patients and further clinical research. TRIAL REGISTRATION: China Clinical Trial

AB  - BACKGROUND: The pretransplant diagnosis of liver malignancies in nodular 
      cirrhotic livers remains a diagnostic challenge despite current advances. 
      Although the prognostic impact of incidental hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) or 
      intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (iCC) in liver transplant recipients is well 
      documented, there are no data on the impact in simultaneous liver kidney 
      transplant (LKT) recipients. METHODS: This is a single-center observational, 
      retrospective study of all LKT performed from May 1993 to April 2022. Among these 
      patients, demographic data, immunosuppressive therapy, rejection episodes, and 
      prevalence of incidental HCC or iCC were evaluated. RESULTS: One hundred eight 
      LKTs were performed and 6 were excluded. There were 13 patients with incidental 
      carcinomas in the explanted liver: one of them with both an HCC and iCC, one with 
      an iCC, and the remaining with an HCC. One case of iCC died. No other recurrences 
      occurred. There were no cases of incidental HCC nor iCC in patients with a 
      hereditary or metabolic LKT indication. We found no differences in the 5-year 
      patient survival, and death-censored kidney and liver graft survival rates for 
      those LKT with an incidental HCC and those without it (76.9% vs 84.2%, P = .5; 
      100% vs 91.6%, P = .28; and 100% vs 94.7%, P = 0.39, respectively). Finally, 
      there were no significant associations between explant carcinoma and rejections 
      of the liver (7.7% vs 17.9%, P = .34) or kidney graft (0% vs 16.8%, P = 0.11). 
      CONCLUSION: Despite a high prevalence of incidental HCC or iCC, patient, kidney, 
      and liver graft 5-year survival were unaffected by incidental HCC.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Updated data on the incidence, prevalence, and regional differences 
      of chronic liver disease are missing from many countries. In this study, we aimed 
      to describe time trends, incidence, prevalence, and mortality of a wide range of 
      chronic liver diseases in Sweden. METHODS: In this register-based, nationwide 
      observational study, patients with a register-based diagnosis of chronic liver 
      disease, during 2005-2019, were retrieved from the Swedish National Board of 
      Health and Welfare. Annual age-standardized incidence and mortality rates, and 
      prevalence per 100,000 inhabitants was calculated and stratified on age, sex, and 
      geographical region. RESULTS: The incidence of alcohol-related cirrhosis 
      increased by 47% (2.6% annually), reaching an incidence rate of 13.1/100,000 
      inhabitants. The incidence rate of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease and 
      unspecified liver cirrhosis increased by 217% and 87% (8.0 and 4.3% annually), 
      respectively, reaching an incidence rate of 15.2 and 18.7/100,000 inhabitants, 
      and a prevalence of 24.7 and 44.8/100,000 inhabitants. Furthermore, incidence 
      rates of chronic hepatitis C declined steeply, but liver malignancies have become 
      more common. The most common causes of liver-related mortality were 
      alcohol-related liver disease and unspecified liver disease. CONCLUSION: The 
      incidence rates of diagnosed non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, alcohol-related 
      cirrhosis, unspecified liver cirrhosis, and liver malignancies have increased 
      during the last 15 years. Worryingly, mortality in several liver diseases 
      increased, likely reflecting increasing incidences of cirrhosis in spite of a 
      decreasing rate of hepatitis C. Significant disparities exist across sex and 
      geographical regions, which need to be considered when allocating healthcare 
      resources.

TI  - The Cancer Incidence and Trends From 2011 to 2018 in Ma'anshan, China: A 
      Registry-Based Observational Study.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The cancer burden in China has been increasing over the decades. 
      However, the cancer incidence remains unknown in Ma'anshan, which is one of the 
      central cities in the Yangtze River Delta in Eastern China. The study was 
      designed to describe the cancer incidence and trends in Ma'anshan from 2011 to 
      2018, providing information about cancer etiology that is useful for prevention 
      programs. METHODS: The cancer incidence rate and age-standardized incidence rate 
      (ASIR) were calculated using the cancer registry data in Ma'anshan during 
      2011-2018. The average annual percentage change (AAPC) of the ASIR was analyzed 
      by the Joinpoint regression analysis. Age, period, and cohort effects on cancer 
      incidence were estimated through the age-period-cohort model. RESULTS: There were 
      13,508 newly diagnosed cancer cases in males and 9558 in females in Ma'anshan 
      during 2011-2018. The ASIR maintained a steady trend in both males and females. 
      Age effects showed that cancer risk increased with age in both genders; no 
      visible period effects were detected during this study period. Cohort effects 
      changed slowly until the end of the 1950s, then started decreasing in males while 
      increasing in females after 1960. Lung, gastric, female breast, colorectal, 
      cervical, esophageal, liver, thyroid, lymphoma, and pancreatic cancer were the 
      most common cancers in Ma'anshan during the study period. The ASIR of gastric 
      cancer (AAPC: -3.72%), esophageal cancer (AAPC: -8.30%), and liver cancer (AAPC: 
      -5.55%) declined, while that of female breast cancer (AAPC: 3.91%), colorectal 
      cancer (AAPC: 3.23%), and thyroid cancer (AAPC: 22.38%) rose. CONCLUSION: During 
      2011-2018, the cancer incidence in Ma'anshan was lower than that in China, 
      nation-wide. The incidence of upper gastrointestinal cancer decreased gradually 
      while female breast, colorectal, and thyroid cancers showed an upward trend, 
      consistent with the changes in the cancer spectrum in China. Further studies 
      should be designed to discover the underlying causes of these findings.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Coronavirus disease of 2019 (COVID-19) is a global health problem. 
      The impact of chronic liver diseases on the course and outcome of COVID-19 is 
      still the subject of research. The aim of this study was to show the 
      characteristics of COVID-19 patients with chronic liver diseases, and to 
      establish the risk factors for unfavourable outcome. METHODS: A retrospective 
      observational study was conducted at the Infectious Disease Clinic in Belgrade, 
      Serbia, and included 80 patients with chronic liver diseases and COVID-19 within 
      a time frame of two years (between 15 March 2020 and 15 March 2022). 
      Characteristics of the affected persons, as well as the risk factors for a fatal 
      outcome, were analyzed. RESULTS: Of the 80 subjects in the study, 23.8% had 
      chronic viral hepatitis, 12.5% autoimmune liver diseases and alcoholic liver 
      disease respectively, 30% had non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, while 11.2% had 
      chronic liver diseases of unknown aetiology. A total of 33.7% had cirrhosis, 6.3% 
      hepatocellular carcinoma and 5% had liver transplants. A total of 92.5% of 
      respondents had pneumonia (21.2% were critically ill). A deterioration of chronic 
      liver disease was registered among 33.7% of patients, and decompensation in 3.8%; 
      76.3% patients recovered, while 23.7% had a lethal outcome. Risk factors for 
      lethal outcome by univariate analysis were: alcoholic liver disease, cirrhosis, 
      increased transaminases values prior to COVID-19, malignancy, severe pneumonia 
      and dyspnea. In a multivariate analysis, the presence of liver cirrhosis (OR = 
      69.1, p = 0.001) and severe pneumonia (OR = 22.3, p = 0.006) remained 
      independently predictive for lethal outcome. CONCLUSION: These findings will help 
      with the evaluation of COVID-19 patients who have chronic liver diseases and will 
      improve their risk stratification.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is rapidly increasing 
      alongside overweight and obesity, not only in adults but also in children and 
      adolescents. It is unknown what impact the development of NAFLD in childhood may 
      have in later life. The importance of early detection and treatment lies in its 
      potential for progression to cirrhosis, liver cancer and liver-related death, as 
      well as its associated extrahepatic comorbidities. Vibration-Controlled Transient 
      Elastography (VCTE) with Controlled Attenuation Parameter (CAP) is an effective, 
      non-invasive and safe diagnostic method to estimate the degree of fibrosis and 
      steatosis in the liver, but little is known about its applicability in the 
      paediatric population. AIMS: 1) To assess the prevalence of significant liver 
      fibrosis (Liver Stiffness Measurement (LSM) ≥6.5 kPa) using VCTE, and that of 
      non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (≥225 dB/m) using CAP in children and 
      adolescents. 2) To determine the optimal cut-off points of the CAP to achieve 
      maximum concordance with the Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) findings in the 
      diagnosis of mild, moderate and severe NAFLD in children and adolescents. 
      METHODS: Cross-sectional population-based study which will include 2,866 subjects 
      aged between 9 and 16 years. Participants will undergo: anamnesis, physical 
      examination, blood extraction, VCTE, MRI and questionnaires on socio-demographic 
      data, personal and family medical history and lifestyle assessment. APPLICABILITY 
      AND RELEVANCE: The study aims to establish the foundations for the use of VCTE in 
      children and adolescents in order to achieve early diagnosis of NAFLD. Moreover, 
      it will serve to understand in further detail the disease and to identify the 
      risk groups of children and adolescents who may be at risk of developing it. 
      Ultimately, this will help determine to which subgroups of the population we need 
      to target resources for prevention and early detection of this entity, as well as 
      possible intervention for its treatment. TRIAL REGISTRATION: The LiverKids study 
      is registered on Clinicaltrials.gov (NCT05526274).

AB  - INTRODUCTION AND OBJECTIVES: We initiated this multicenter study to integrate 
      important risk factors to create a nomogram for hepatitis B virus (HBV)-related 
      hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) for clinician decision-making. PATIENTS AND 
      METHODS: Between April 2011 and March 2022, 2281 HCC patients with an HBV-related 
      diagnosis were included. All patients were randomly divided into two groups in a 
      ratio of 7:3 (training cohort, n = 1597; validation cohort, n = 684). The 
      nomogram was built in the training cohort via Cox regression model and validated 
      in the validation cohort. RESULTS: Multivariate Cox analyses revealed that the 
      portal vein tumor thrombus, Child-Pugh class, tumor diameter, alanine 
      aminotransferase level, tumor number, extrahepatic metastases, and therapy were 
      independent predictive variables impacting overall survival. We constructed a new 
      nomogram to predict 1-, 2-, and 3-year survival rates based on these factors. The 
      nomogram-related receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curves indicated that 
      the area under the curve (AUC) values were 0.809, 0.806, and 0.764 in predicting 
      1-, 2-, and 3-year survival rates, respectively. Furthermore, the calibration 
      curves revealed good agreement between real measurements and nomogram 
      predictions. The decision curve analyses (DCA) curves demonstrated excellent 
      therapeutic application potential. In addition, stratified by risk scores, 
      low-risk groups had longer median OS than medium-high-risk groups (p < 0.001). 
      CONCLUSIONS: The nomogram we constructed showed good performance in predicting 
      the 1-year survival rate for HBV- related HCC.

TI  - Hepatitis C Virus-Related One-Year Hepatocellular Carcinoma Recurrence After 
      Directly Acting Antivirals: A Randomized Controlled Trial.
PG  - 913-923
LID - 10.1007/s12029-024-01035-5 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Available data on hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) recurrence after 
      direct-acting antivirals (DAAs) treatment for hepatitis C virus (HCV) are 
      conflicting. No randomized trials were done. This study aims to compare the 
      1-year HCC recurrence rates in patients who received DAAs after tumor ablation 
      versus those who postponed HCV treatment for 1 year. METHODS: Included patients 
      were randomized after complete HCC ablation into two groups: a postponed DAAs 
      group for whom DAAs initiation was postponed for 12 months and a DAAs group who 
      were given sofosbuvir/velpatasvir. Patients were followed for 1 year. RESULTS: 
      Eighty-four HCV patients with a mean age of 56.35 ± 8.12 years were included; 
      78.57% of them were males. The number of lesions per patient ranged from 1 to 3 
      lesions, and the size of the largest lesion ranged from 1.5 to 5 cm. There were 
      no statistically significant differences between both groups regarding baseline 
      characteristics. In the DAAs group (43 patients), 11 patients had HCC recurrence, 
      while 25 patients in the postponed DAAs group (41 patients) had HCC recurrence. 
      Using Kaplan-Meier analysis, the 1-year recurrence-free survival (RFS) was 
      significantly higher in the DAAs group (72.2% vs. 38%, P = 0.001). On 
      multivariate analysis, both higher albumin levels (HR 0.147, 95% CI 0.066-0.329) 
      and receiving DAAs (HR 0.358, 95% CI 0.176-0.730) 1 year after ablation were 
      associated with significantly lower recurrence. CONCLUSION: Direct-acting 
      antiviral usage after complete hepatocellular carcinoma ablation significantly 
      decreases the 1-year HCC recurrence rates, but the risk of recurrence is still 
      not eliminated. The study registration number on clinicaltrials.gov : NCT04653818

AB  - TACE has become one of the main methods for the treatment of liver cancer. The 
      study aimed to investigate the effects of preoperative interview and prospective 
      nursing in patients with hepatic carcinoma undergoing transcatheter 
      chemoembolization (TACE). Eighty-six patients with hepatocellular carcinoma who 
      underwent TACE intervention treatment at our hospital between 2020 and 2023 were 
      selected and randomly assigned to 2 groups using computerized randomization. The 
      control group (n = 43) received routine nursing care, while the study group 
      (n = 43) received preoperative interviews in combination with prospective nursing 
      during the procedure. The patients' heart rate, mean arterial pressure, and blood 
      pressure variations were recorded, along with their mood changes after 
      intervention. The postoperative pain and satisfaction levels were compared 
      between the 2 groups of patients, and the incidence of postoperative 
      complications was observed. The heart rate, systolic blood pressure, and 
      diastolic blood pressure of the 2 groups of patients were compared 1 day before 
      the operation (P > .05). Compared to 1 day before the operation, there was no 
      significant change for the study group at 10 minutes after entering the room. 
      However, the control group showed an increase. Both groups showed an increase in 
      heart rate, systolic blood pressure, and diastolic blood pressure after the 
      operation, with the study group having lower values than the control group 
      (P < .05). The levels of tension, fatigue, anxiety, energy, anger, depression, 
      self-esteem, and POMS index were compared between the 2 groups before 
      intervention (P > .05). After intervention, there were significant differences 
      between the 2 groups(P < .05). Immediately after the operation, the NRS scores of 
      the 2 groups of patients were compared (P > .05). Compared to the control group, 
      the study group showed a decrease in NRS scores at 12, 24, and 48 hours after the 
      operation (P < .05). The nursing satisfaction rate of the study group patients 
      was 97.67% (42/43), which was higher than the nursing satisfaction rate of the 
      control group of 76.74% (33/43) (P < .05). Compared to routine nursing, 
      preoperative visits and prospective nursing interventions can effectively 
      alleviate patients' psychological stress reactions, relieve pain, reduce the 
      incidence of complications, and improve patients' satisfaction with nursing care.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is an increasing cause of mortality 
      in Nigeria among persons with HIV (PLH), as access to antiretroviral therapy 
      (ART) improves. In this study we describe clinical, radiological, and laboratory 
      characteristics in Nigerian adults with HCC, with and without HIV, and examine 
      how HIV impacts survival. METHODS: This prospective observational study was 
      conducted between August 2018 and November 2021 at two Nigerian hospitals [Jos 
      University Teaching Hospital (JUTH) and Lagos University Teaching Hospital 
      (LUTH)]. Subjects ≥18 years with HCC diagnosed according to American Association 
      for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD) criteria were included. Baseline 
      characteristics were compared, and Kaplan-Meier curves were generated to estimate 
      survival. RESULTS: 213 subjects [177 (83%) without HIV and 36 (17%) with HIV 
      (PLH)] were enrolled. Median age was 52 years (IQR 42,60) and most subjects were 
      male (71%). 83% PLH were on antiretroviral therapy (ART). Hepatitis B surface 
      antigen (HBsAg) positivity was similar between the two groups [91/177 (51%) 
      without HIV vs. 18/36 (50%) with HIV; p = 0.86]. 46/213 (22%) subjects had active 
      hepatitis C (anti-HCV+/HCV RNA>10 IU/mL). Cirrhosis was more common in PLH but 
      there were no other significant differences in clinical and tumor characteristics 
      between the groups. Overall, 99% subjects were symptomatic and 78% in late-stage 
      HCC. Median overall survival was significantly shorter in PLH vs. without HIV 
      (0.98 months vs 3.02 months, HR = 1.55, 95%CI 1.02, 2.37, p = 0.04). This 
      association was not significant after adjusting for known risk factors including 
      gender, current alcohol use, alpha-fetoprotein (AFP), albumin, and total 
      bilirubin (HR = 1.38, 95%CI 0.84, 2.29, p = 0.21). CONCLUSION: HCC presented late 
      with an extremely poor overall prognosis, highlighting the urgent need for more 
      intensive surveillance in Nigeria to diagnose HCC at earlier stages. Early 
      diagnosis and management of viral hepatitis, and access to HCC therapies, could 
      prevent early mortality among persons with HCC, especially among PLH.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: The prevalence of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) ranges 
      from 25% in the general population to 90% in patients with obesity scheduled for 
      bariatric surgery. NAFLD can progress towards non-alcoholic steatohepatitis 
      (NASH) associated with complications such as cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma 
      and cardiovascular disease. To date, losing weight and lifestyle modifications 
      are the best known treatments for NASH. Bariatric surgery significantly improves 
      NAFLD/NASH in the short term. However, the extent of this improvement is not yet 
      clear and long-term data on the natural course of NAFLD/NASH after bariatric 
      surgery are lacking. The factors involved in NAFLD/NASH regression after 
      bariatric surgery have not been elucidated. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: This is an 
      observational prospective cohort study including patients scheduled for bariatric 
      surgery. Extensive metabolic and cardiovascular analyses will be carried out 
      including measurements of carotid intima media thickness and pulse wave velocity. 
      Genomic, proteomic, lipidomic and metabolomic studies will be done. Microbioma 
      analyses before and 1 year after surgery will be done. Transient elastography 
      measurements will be performed before and at 1, 3 and 5 years after surgery. For 
      those with an elevated preoperative transient elastography measurement by 
      Fibroscan, a laparoscopic liver biopsy will be performed during surgery. Primary 
      outcome measures are the change of steatosis and liver fibrosis 5 years after 
      surgery. Secondary outcome measure is the comparison of the transient 
      elastography measurements with the NAFLD Activity Score from the biopsies. ETHICS 
      AND DISSEMINATION: The protocol has been approved by the Medical Research Ethics 
      Committees United, Nieuwegein, on 1 March 2022 (registration code 
      R21.103/NL79423.100.21). The study results will be submitted for publication in 
      peer-reviewed journals and data will be presented at scientific meetings. TRIAL

AB  - BACKGROUND OR PURPOSE: Although human umbilical cord blood-derived mesenchymal 
      stem cell transplantation (HUCB-MSCT) resulted in a good short-term therapeutic 
      effect on patients with decompensated liver cirrhosis (DLC), the long-term 
      survival remained unclear. This study aimed to evaluate the impact of HUCB-MSCT 
      on long-term outcomes in patients with DLC. METHODS: This retrospective cohort 
      study included hospitalized patients with decompensated cirrhosis in Liuzhou 
      Hospital of Traditional Chinese Medicine between November 2010 and February 2013. 
      The primary outcome was overall survival (OS). The secondary outcomes were 3-year 
      and 5-year survival rates and the occurrence rate of hepatocellular carcinoma 
      (HCC). RESULTS: A total of 201 subjects were enrolled, including 36 patients who 
      underwent HUCB-MSCT (SCT group) and 165 patients who did not (non-SCT group). 
      After PSM (1:2), there were 36 patients in the SCT group and 72 patients in 
      non-SCT group. The 3-year and 5-year survival rates of the two groups were 83.3% 
      vs. 61.8% and 63.9% vs. 43.6%, and median OS time was 92.50 and 50.80 months, 
      respectively. HUCB-MSCT treatment was found to be an independent beneficial 
      factor for patient OS (hazard ratio = 0.47; 95% CI: 0.29-0.76; P = 0.002). There 
      was no significant difference in the occurrence rate of HCC between the two 
      groups (P = 0.410). DISCUSSION OR CONCLUSIONS: HUCB-MSCT may improve long-term OS 
      without increasing the occurrence of HCC in patients with DLC. TRIAL

TI  - Dose finding study for unilobar radioembolization using holmium-166 microspheres 
      to improve resectability in patients with HCC: the RALLY protocol.

AB  - BACKGROUND: High dose unilobar radioembolization (also termed 'radiation 
      lobectomy')-the transarterial unilobar infusion of radioactive microspheres as a 
      means of controlling tumour growth while concomitantly inducing future liver 
      remnant hypertrophy-has recently gained interest as induction strategy for 
      surgical resection. Prospective studies on the safety and efficacy of the 
      unilobar radioembolization-surgery treatment algorithm are lacking. The RALLY 
      study aims to assess the safety and toxicity profile of holmium-166 unilobar 
      radioembolization in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma ineligible for 
      surgery due to insufficiency of the future liver remnant. METHODS: The RALLY 
      study is a multicenter, interventional, non-randomized, open-label, 
      non-comparative safety study. Patients with hepatocellular carcinoma who are 
      considered ineligible for surgery due to insufficiency of the future liver 
      remnant (< 2.7%/min/m(2) on hepatobiliary iminodiacetic acid scan will be 
      included. A classical 3 + 3 dose escalation model will be used, enrolling three 
      to six patients in each cohort. The primary objective is to determine the maximum 
      tolerated treated non-tumourous liver-absorbed dose (cohorts of 50, 60, 70 and 
      80 Gy). Secondary objectives are to evaluate dose-response relationships, to 
      establish the safety and feasibility of surgical resection following unilobar 
      radioembolization, to assess quality of life, and to generate a biobank. 
      DISCUSSION: This will be the first clinical study to assess the unilobar 
      radioembolization-surgery treatment algorithm and may serve as a stepping stone 
      towards its implementation in routine clinical practice. TRIAL REGISTRATION:

TI  - Impact of body composition in advanced hepatocellular carcinoma: A subanalysis of 
      the SORAMIC trial.
LID - 10.1097/HC9.0000000000000165 [doi]
LID - e0165
AB  - BACKGROUND: Body composition parameters have been reported to be prognostic 
      factors in patients with oncologic diseases. However, the available data on 
      patients with HCC are conflicting. The aim of this study was to assess the impact 
      of body composition on survival in patients with HCC treated with sorafenib or 
      selective internal radioembolization (SIRT) and sorafenib. METHODS: This is an 
      exploratory subanalysis of the prospective, randomized controlled SORAMIC trial. 
      Within the palliative arm of the study, patients were selected if a baseline 
      abdominal CT was available. A broad set of skeletal muscle and adipose tissue 
      parameters were measured at the L3 level. Low skeletal muscle mass (LSMM) and 
      density parameters were defined using published cutoffs. The parameters were 
      correlated with overall survival. RESULTS: Of 424 patients in the palliative 
      study arm, 369 patients were included in the analysis. There were 192 patients in 
      the combined sorafenib/SIRT and 177 patients in the sorafenib group. Median 
      overall survival was 9.9 months for the entire cohort and 10.8 and 9.2 months for 
      the SIRT/sorafenib and sorafenib groups, respectively. There was no relevant 
      association of either body composition parameter with overall survival in either 
      the overall cohort or in the SIRT/sorafenib or sorafenib subgroups. CONCLUSIONS: 
      This subanalysis of the prospective SORAMIC trial does not suggest a relevant 
      influence of body composition parameters of survival in patients with advanced 
      HCC. Body composition parameters therefore do not serve in patient allocation in 
      this palliative treatment cohort.

      Real-world Data in Taiwan-Tainan Medical Oncology Group H01 Trial.
PG  - 454-460
LID - 10.21873/invivo.13099 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND/AIM: The combination of bevacizumab and atezolizumab (Bev-Ate) has 
      been established as a standard first-line systemic treatment option for 
      unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) since 2020. This study examined the 
      outcomes of HCC patients who received the combination in southern Taiwan. 
      PATIENTS AND METHODS: All patients were enrolled from four hospitals in Taiwan. 
      They received Bev-Ate therapy for unresectable HCC. RESULTS: Thirty-five patients 
      were included; 28 (80%) had Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer stage C disease. 
      Hepatitis etiology was chronic hepatitis B and C in 63% and 17% of patients, 
      respectively. Eleven (31%) patients had received prior systemic treatment for 
      unresectable HCC. The response rate was 51%, and the disease control rate was 72% 
      for all patients. The median progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival 
      (OS) was 5.2 and 22.2 months, respectively. For patients who received prior 
      systemic treatment, the efficacy of Bev-Ate in terms of response rates was 
      similar compared with those without prior systemic treatment. Patients who 
      received lower doses of bevacizumab (<15 mg/kg per dose) had non-inferior PFS and 
      OS compared with those receiving a standard dose of bevacizumab. The incidence of 
      proteinuria of all grades (15.8%) was less common when lower doses of bevacizumab 
      were used. CONCLUSION: Real world data from HCC patients in southern Taiwan 
      disclosed that the efficacy outcomes of Bev-Ate treatment were generally 
      consistent with those of clinical trials in other countries. In patients who were 
      exposed to prior systemic treatment or who received lower doses of bevacizumab, 
      the Bev-Ate regimen retained its clinical efficacy.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Distinguishing between primary clear cell carcinoma of the liver 
      (PCCCL) and common hepatocellular carcinoma (CHCC) through traditional inspection 
      methods before the operation is difficult. This study aimed to establish a Faster 
      region-based convolutional neural network (RCNN) model for the accurate 
      differential diagnosis of PCCCL and CHCC. METHODS: In this study, we collected 
      the data of 62 patients with PCCCL and 1079 patients with CHCC in Beijing YouAn 
      Hospital from June 2012 to May 2020. A total of 109 patients with CHCC and 42 
      patients with PCCCL were randomly divided into the training validation set and 
      the test set in a ratio of 4:1.The Faster RCNN was used for deep learning of 
      patients' data in the training validation set, and established a convolutional 
      neural network model to distinguish PCCCL and CHCC. The accuracy, average 
      precision, and the recall of the model for diagnosing PCCCL and CHCC were used to 
      evaluate the detection performance of the Faster RCNN algorithm. RESULTS: A total 
      of 4392 images of 121 patients (1032 images of 33 patients with PCCCL and 3360 
      images of 88 patients with CHCC) were uesd in test set for deep learning and 
      establishing the model, and 1072 images of 30 patients (320 images of nine 
      patients with PCCCL and 752 images of 21 patients with CHCC) were used to test 
      the model. The accuracy of the model for accurately diagnosing PCCCL and CHCC was 
      0.962 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.931-0.992). The average precision of the 
      model for diagnosing PCCCL was 0.908 (95% CI: 0.823-0.993) and that for 
      diagnosing CHCC was 0.907 (95% CI: 0.823-0.993). The recall of the model for 
      diagnosing PCCCL was 0.951 (95% CI: 0.916-0.985) and that for diagnosing CHCC was 
      0.960 (95% CI: 0.854-0.962). The time to make a diagnosis using the model took an 
      average of 4 s for each patient. CONCLUSION: The Faster RCNN model can accurately 
      distinguish PCCCL and CHCC. This model could be important for clinicians to make 
      appropriate treatment plans for patients with PCCCL or CHCC.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Indoleamine-2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) helps orchestrate immune 
      suppression and checkpoint inhibitor resistance in hepatocellular carcinoma 
      (HCC). BMS-986,205 is a novel oral drug that potently and selectively inhibits 
      IDO. This Phase I/II study evaluated the safety and tolerability of BMS-986,205 
      in combination with nivolumab as first-line therapy in advanced HCC. METHODS: 
      Adults with untreated, unresectable/metastatic HCC received BMS-986,205 at two 
      dose levels (50-100 mg orally daily) in combination with fixed dose nivolumab 
      (240mg/m(2) IV on Day 1 of each 14-day cycle). The primary objective was to 
      determine the safety and tolerability of this combination; secondary objectives 
      were to obtain preliminary efficacy. RESULTS: Eight patients received a total of 
      91 treatment cycles in the dose escalation phase. All patients were Child Pugh A 
      and 6 patients had underlying viral hepatitis. In the 6 evaluable patients, no 
      dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) were observed. The most common treatment-related 
      adverse events (TRAEs) were aspartate transaminase (AST) and alanine transaminase 
      (ALT) elevation (3 patients) and diarrhea, maculopapular rash and increased 
      alkaline phosphatase (2 patients each). Grade 3 events were diarrhea and AST 
      elevation (1 patient), and hyperglycemia and pancreatitis requiring treatment 
      discontinuation (1 patient). No grade 4-5 events occurred. Partial response was 
      observed in 1 patient (12.5%) and stable disease in 3 patients (37.5%), yielding 
      a disease control rate of 50%. Median PFS was 8.5 weeks; median OS was not 
      reached. CONCLUSION: Combination BMS-986,205 and nivolumab showed a manageable 
      safety profile with durable benefit as first-line therapy in a meaningful subset 
      of advanced HCC patients.

AB  - Introduction: to explore the effect of individualized nutritional intervention on 
      the nutritional status of patients with liver cancer after transcatheter arterial 
      chemoembolization (TACE). Methods: 56 patients who underwent TACE in our hospital 
      from March 2022 to March 2023 were selected as the study subjects. The patients 
      were randomly divided into a control group (28 cases) and an intervention group 
      (28 cases). The control group received routine dietary intervention, while the 
      intervention group received individualized nutritional intervention. We analyzed 
      the body mass index (BMI), nutritional risk screening 2002 (NRS 2002), 
      nutritional status, liver function status, and incidence of complications in two 
      groups of patients before TACE, 3 days after TACE, and 1 month after TACE. 
      Results: on the third day after TACE, the nutritional related indicators of both 
      groups of patients showed a significantly decrease compared to those before TACE 
      (p < 0.05), while the majority of liver function indicators significantly 
      increased (p < 0.05). Compared with those at 3 days after TACE, the nutritional 
      status of the intervention group patients significantly improved (p < 0.05) and 
      liver function indicators significantly decreased (p < 0.05) 1 month after TACE. 
      One month after TACE, all nutritional indicators in the intervention group were 
      significantly higher than those in the control group (p < 0.05), and AST was 
      significantly lower than that in the control group (p < 0.05). The incidence of 
      gastrointestinal complications and electrolyte disorders in the intervention 
      group were significantly lower than that in the control group (p < 0.05). 
      Conclusion Individualized nutritional intervention can effectively improve 
      nutritional status, improve liver function, and reduce the incidence of 
      postoperative complications in liver cancer patients after TACE. It was worth 
      promoting.

TI  - Feasibility of a Palliative Care Intervention within Routine Care of 
      Hepatocellular Carcinoma: A Pilot Randomized Controlled Trial.
PG  - 334-341
LID - 10.1089/jpm.2022.0338 [doi]
AB  - Background: Patients with hepatocellular cancer (HCC) are at risk for poor 
      quality of life (QoL) and high symptom burden, coupled with limited treatment 
      options. Palliative care (PC) can play an important role in reducing the 
      suffering of this population, but remains underutilized. Aim: To demonstrate 
      feasibility of an outpatient PC intervention within HCC care. Methods: This is a 
      pilot randomized controlled trial conducted at an academic center. All stages of 
      HCC patients (except Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer stage D) with a scheduled 
      hepatology appointment were eligible. Patients were randomized to receive PC 
      intervention or usual care (control arm). In the PC arm, patients received PC 
      from a PC provider at enrollment and at three months from the baseline visit, in 
      addition to continued standard of care. Control arm received only standard care. 
      All patients completed FACT-Hep (Functional Assessment of Cancer 
      Therapy-Hepatobiliary Cancer) and modified Edmonton Symptom Assessment Scale at 
      baseline and at three-month visit. Descriptive statistics were utilized to 
      summarize questionnaires, and change in QoL and symptoms from baseline to three 
      months were compared between the two study groups. Results: Of the 109 
      approached, 57 patients (52.3%) consented to enroll, and 52 (91%) completed the 
      study. QoL and symptom burden assessments demonstrated impaired QoL and high 
      symptom burden in both arms of the study. At least 50% of enrolled patients in 
      each arm had some degree of fatigue, pain, sleep disturbance, and appetite loss, 
      at baseline. Post-intervention, symptom burden and QoL improved in the 
      intervention arm and remained same or worsened in the control group. All FACT-Hep 
      scores decreased numerically among controls and increased numerically among 
      patients in the PC intervention group. Conclusion: Outpatient PC intervention 
      within routine HCC care is feasible, and can potentially improve QoL and 
      symptoms.

TI  - Screening and risk of hepatocellular carcinoma in patients with advanced fibrosis 
      after hepatitis C virus eradication.
PG  - 305-311
LID - 10.17235/reed.2024.9945/2023 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: the risk of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) after eradication of the 
      hepatitis C virus (HCV) is highly variable in patients with advanced fibrosis 
      (F3). Long-term surveillance for HCC after sustained virological response (SVR) 
      is controversial in these patients. The objective of this study was to describe 
      the post-SVR follow-up in clinical practice in patients with F3 and determine the 
      predictive factors for the development of HCC. PATIENTS AND METHODS: a 
      multicenter, observational and retrospective study was performed, which included 
      HCV-monoinfected patients with F3 fibrosis determined by transient elastography 
      who achieved SVR between 2015 and 2022, with follow-up until May 2023. 
      Clinical-demographic, laboratory, elastography, and ultrasound variables were 
      recorded before and after treatment. A descriptive and inferential analysis, Cox 
      regression analysis and survival analysis were carried out with the R statistical 
      software. RESULTS: two hundred and nineteen patients were included in the study 
      (65.3 % males, median age 57 years), and 175 (79.9 %) received ultrasound 
      screening after SVR for 62 (6-90) months. The prescribing service was the only 
      independent variable related to performing ultrasound surveillance (p = 0.004). 
      Eight patients developed HCC. In multivariate analysis adjusted for sex, age, 
      presence of diabetes and alcohol consumption, a post-SVR FIB-4 ≥ 3.25 was 
      associated with a 12-fold increase in HCC risk. The cumulative probability of HCC 
      was higher in the group of patients with FIB-4 ≥ 3.25 after SVR (p < 0.001). 
      CONCLUSION: post-SVR follow-up of patients with F3 fibrosis is variable in 
      clinical practice. Using the FIB-4 after SVR allows us to identify those patients 
      with a higher risk of HCC who benefit from biannual ultrasound screening.

AB  - BACKGROUND: This observational study aims to establish the feasibility of using 
      x-ray images of radio-opaque chemoembolisation deposits in patients as a method 
      for real-time image-guided radiation therapy of hepatocellular carcinoma. 
      METHODS: This study will recruit 50 hepatocellular carcinoma patients who have 
      had or will have stereotactic ablative radiation therapy and have had 
      transarterial chemoembolisation with a radio-opaque agent. X-ray and computed 
      tomography images of the patients will be analysed retrospectively. Additionally, 
      a deep learning method for real-time motion tracking will be developed. We 
      hypothesise that: (i) deep learning software can be developed that will 
      successfully track the contrast agent mass on two thirds of cone beam computed 
      tomography (CBCT) projection and intra-treatment images (ii), the mean and 
      standard deviation (mm) difference in the location of the mass between ground 
      truth and deep learning detection are ≤ 2 mm and ≤ 3 mm respectively and (iii) 
      statistical modelling of study data will predict tracking success in 85% of trial 
      participants. DISCUSSION: Developing a real-time tracking method will enable 
      increased targeting accuracy, without the need for additional invasive procedures 
      to implant fiducial markers. TRIAL REGISTRATION: Registered to ClinicalTrials.gov 
      (NCT05169177) 12th October 2021.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIM: The association between lung function with non-alcoholic 
      fatty liver disease (NAFLD) in the general population remains unknown. We aimed 
      to examine the association between lung function and NAFLD among the general 
      population in an observational and Mendelian randomization (MR) study. METHODS 
      AND RESULTS: 340, 253 participants without prior liver diseases were included 
      from the UK Biobank. Of these, 30,397 participants had liver proton density fat 
      fraction (PDFF) measurements by magnetic resonance image (MRI). Lung function 
      parameters included forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1) and forced vital 
      capacity (FVC). The primary outcome was the presence of NAFLD, defined as a PDFF 
      greater than 5.5%. The secondary outcome included incident severe NAFLD and 
      severe liver diseases (including liver cirrhosis, liver failure, hepatocellular 
      carcinoma and liver-related death), defined by the International Classification 
      of Disease codes with different data sources. During a media follow-up duration 
      of 9.3 years, 7335 (24.1%) the presence of NAFLD cases were documented. There was 
      an inverse association of FEV1 (% predicted) (Per SD increment, adjusted 
      OR = 0.91, 95%CI: 0.88-0.94) and FVC (% predicted) (Per SD increment, adjusted 
      OR = 0.90, 95%CI: 0.87-0.92) with the presence of NAFLD. Similar results were 
      found for incident severe NAFLD, severe liver disease, liver cirrhosis, liver 
      failure and liver-related death. MR analyses showed that the genetically 
      predicted FEV1 (adjusted OR = 0.63, 95%CI: 0.46-0.87) and FVC (adjusted 
      OR = 0.69, 95%CI: 0.51-0.95) were both inversely associated with the presence of 
      NAFLD. CONCLUSIONS: There was an inverse causal relationship between lung 
      function and NAFLD in the general population.

TI  - Transfusions of packed red blood cells in surgery for liver cancer: predictor of 
      impaired overall survival but not recurrence-free survival - impact of blood 
      transfusions in liver surgery.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Liver surgery remains a cornerstone of potentially curative 
      multimodal treatments for primary malignancies of the liver and hepatic 
      metastases. Improving perioperative safety is a prerequisite in this context. 
      Perioperative blood transfusions negatively influence postoperative recovery. 
      This study aimed to identify risk factors for perioperative packed red blood cell 
      (PRBC) transfusion and to elucidate its effect on postoperative outcomes. 
      METHODS: This was an observational study of a prospective data collection. A 
      monocentric, retrospective analysis of 1118 hepatectomies at the University 
      Hospital Carl Gustav Carus between 2013 and 2020 was conducted to compare 
      postoperative short- and long-term outcomes in patients undergoing curative 
      intended liver resection of hepatic primary or secondary malignancies. The 
      outcomes were compared between 356 patients (31.8%) who received PRBC 
      transfusions during surgery or within 7 days after surgery and 762 patients 
      (68.2%) who did not receive PRBC transfusions. RESULTS: Preoperative anemia could 
      be observed in 45.0% of the whole cohort: 65.7% in the PRBC transfusion group and 
      35.3% in the nontransfused group. Postoperative complications were significantly 
      more common in the PRBC transfusion group in association with prolonged lengths 
      of hospital stay and increased 30-day mortality than in the nontransfused group. 
      After adjustment for possible confounders, preexisting kidney failure, 
      preoperative hemoglobin and albumin levels outside of the reference range, 
      intraoperative plasma transfusions, and overall surgery time were recognized as 
      negative predictors for perioperative PRBC transfusions. PRBC transfusion 
      increased the risk of death by approximately 38.8% (hazard ratio, 1.388; 95% CI, 
      1.027-1.876; P = .033), whereas no influence on recurrence-free survival (RFS) 
      was observed. CONCLUSION: PRBC transfusions were associated with postoperative 
      morbidity and mortality after curative-intended surgery for liver cancers and 
      represented an independent poor prognostic indicator for overall survival but not 
      for RFS.

TI  - CEUS in prediction of early recurrence of hepatocellular carcinoma after curative 
      resection and to stratify the risk of early recurrence: a retrospective 
      observational study.
PG  - 1870-1880
LID - 10.1007/s00261-024-04252-5 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Early recurrence (ER) after surgery is related to early death in 
      patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) after radical resection. To explore 
      the role of preoperative contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) in predicting ER of 
      HCC after curative resection and to stratify the risk of ER. MATERIALS AND 
      METHODS: This study evaluated consecutive 556 patients with HCC who were examined 
      by CEUS during the 2 weeks before curative resection between January 2011 and 
      December 2018. ER was defined as intrahepatic and/or extrahepatic recurrence 
      within 2 year after resection of HCC. Univariate and logistic regression analyses 
      were performed to identify independent risk factors for ER after surgical 
      resection of HCC. Recurrence-free time (RFS) rates were analyzed and compared by 
      log-rank test. RESULTS: ER occurred in 307 (55.2%) of the 556 patients. 
      Univariate and multivariate analyses revealed that a tumor size ≥ 30 mm and 
      satellite nodules seen on CEUS, DL(deep learning) radiomics reoccurrence score 
      based on the frame of image with the maximum intensity of CEUS and an elevated 
      alpha-fetoprotein level were significantly associated with ER (P < .05). Based on 
      the number of predictors present, patients with CEUS LR-5 HCC were stratified 
      into three risk subgroups: risk group 3 (high-risk patients, 4 predictors), risk 
      group 2 (medium-risk patients, 2-3 predictors), and risk group 1 (low-risk 
      patients, 0-1 predictor). The 2-year RFS rate was 19.4% in risk group 3, 40.9% in 
      risk group 2, and 48.1% in risk group 1; the corresponding mean RFS times were 
      14.0 ± 2.9 months, 43.7 ± 6.6 months, and 55.5 ± 2.8 months, respectively 
      (P < .001). CONCLUSIONS: Tumor size ≥ 30 mm and satellite nodules seen on CEUS, 
      DL radiomics reoccurrence score based on the frame of image with the maximum 
      intensity of CEUS and an elevated alpha-fetoprotein level can predict ER of HCC.

AB  - Purpose To compare the image quality and diagnostic capability in detecting 
      malignant liver tumors of low-dose CT (LDCT, 33% dose) with deep learning-based 
      denoising (DLD) and standard-dose CT (SDCT, 100% dose) with model-based iterative 
      reconstruction (MBIR). Materials and Methods In this prospective, multicenter, 
      noninferiority study, individuals referred for liver CT scans were enrolled from 
      three tertiary referral hospitals between February 2021 and August 2022. All 
      liver CT scans were conducted using a dual-source scanner with the dose split 
      into tubes A (67% dose) and B (33% dose). Blended images from tubes A and B were 
      created using MBIR to produce SDCT images, whereas LDCT images used data from 
      tube B and were reconstructed with DLD. The noise in liver images was measured 
      and compared between imaging techniques. The diagnostic performance of each 
      technique in detecting malignant liver tumors was evaluated by three independent 
      radiologists using jackknife alternative free-response receiver operating 
      characteristic analysis. Noninferiority of LDCT compared with SDCT was declared 
      when the lower limit of the 95% CI for the difference in figure of merit (FOM) 
      was greater than -0.10. Results A total of 296 participants (196 men, 100 women; 
      mean age, 60.5 years ± 13.3 [SD]) were included. The mean noise level in the 
      liver was significantly lower for LDCT (10.1) compared with SDCT (10.7) (P < 
      .001). Diagnostic performance was assessed in 246 participants (108 malignant 
      tumors in 90 participants). The reader-averaged FOM was 0.880 for SDCT and 0.875 
      for LDCT (P = .35). The difference fell within the noninferiority margin 
      (difference, -0.005 [95% CI: -0.024, 0.012]). Conclusion Compared with SDCT with 
      MBIR, LDCT using 33% of the standard radiation dose had reduced image noise and 
      comparable diagnostic performance in detecting malignant liver tumors. Keywords:

TI  - Positive impact of obesity on the prognosis of liver cirrhosis.
PG  - 1663-1672
LID - 10.1111/jgh.16590 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIM: The study aims to determine the prognostic impact of obesity, 
      sarcopenic obesity, and dynapenic obesity in patients with chronic liver disease. 
      METHODS: This retrospective observational study enrolled patients with chronic 
      hepatitis (n = 746) and liver cirrhosis (n = 434) without hepatocellular 
      carcinoma at entry. The patients were evaluated for sarcopenia and obesity 
      between April 2016 and April 2022. Obesity was defined as a body mass index of 
      ≥ 25 kg/m(2). Sarcopenic obesity was defined as low skeletal muscle mass 
      (pre-sarcopenia) with obesity and dynapenic obesity was defined as low muscle 
      strength (dynapenia) with obesity. The effects of obesity on survival were 
      evaluated retrospectively. RESULTS: The mean observation period was 2.5 years. 
      Obesity, sarcopenic obesity, and dynapenic obesity were found in 271 (45.5%), 17 
      (2.9%), and 21 (3.5%) men, and 261 (44.7%), 59 (10.1%), and 53 (9.1%) women, 
      respectively. A multivariate Cox proportional hazards model revealed that 
      Child-Pugh class, dynapenia (hazard ratio [HR] 3.89), elderly (≥ 65 years old) 
      (HR 2.11), and obesity (HR 0.58) were independently associated with overall 
      survival (OS). However, neither sarcopenic nor dynapenic obesity were associated 
      with OS. In patients with cirrhosis, the OS of the obese group was significantly 
      higher than that of the non-obese group. The effect of obesity on OS was 
      significant in elderly patients, but not in younger patients. CONCLUSIONS: 
      Sarcopenic and dynapenic obesity seem unrelated to the prognosis of patients with 
      chronic liver disease. Obesity has a positive effect on the prognosis of elderly 
      patients with cirrhosis.

TI  - Modular multimodal hospital-home chain physical activity rehabilitation programme 
      (3M2H-PARP) in liver cancer: a protocol for a randomised controlled trial.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Patients with liver cancer are susceptible to experiencing a 
      decline in muscle mass and function, which can lead to physical frailty and have 
      a negative impact on prognosis. However, there is currently a lack of physical 
      activity interventions specifically tailored for these patients. Therefore, we 
      have developed a modular multimodal hospital-home chain physical activity 
      rehabilitation programme (3M2H-PARP) designed specifically for patients with 
      liver cancer undergoing transarterial chemoembolisation (TACE). We aim to 
      validate the effectiveness and feasibility of this programme through a randomised 
      controlled trial (RCT). METHODS AND ANALYSIS: 3M2H-PARP RCT will compare a 
      12-week, modular, multimodal physical activity rehabilitation programme that 
      includes supervised exercise in a hospital setting and self-management exercise 
      at home. The programmes consist of aerobic, resistance, flexibility and balance 
      exercise modules, and standard survivorship care in a cohort of liver cancer 
      survivors who have undergone TACE. The control group will receive standard care. 
      A total of 152 participants will be randomly assigned to either the 3M2H-PARP 
      group or the control group. Assessments will be conducted at three time points: 
      baseline, after completing the intervention and a 24-week follow-up visit. The 
      following variables will be evaluated: liver frailty index, Functional Assessment 
      of Cancer Therapy-Hepatobiliary subscale, Cancer Fatigue Scale, Pittsburgh Sleep 
      Quality Index, Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale and physical activity level. 
      After the completion of the training programme, semi-structured interviews will 
      be conducted with participants from the 3M2H-PARP group to investigate the 
      programme's impact on their overall well-being. SPSS V.26.0 software will be used 
      for statistical analyses. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Ethical approval has been 
      granted by the Jiangnan University School of Medicine Research Ethics Committee. 
      The findings will be disseminated through publication in a peer-reviewed journal.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Percutaneous radiofrequency ablation (RFA) is pivotal for treating 
      small malignant liver tumors, but tumors often remain inconspicuous on B-mode 
      ultrasound (US). This study evaluates the potential of CEUS-CT/MRI fusion imaging 
      (FI) to improve tumor visibility and the associated RFA outcomes for small 
      (≤ 3 cm) malignant liver tumors that were inconspicuous on US. METHODS: Between 
      January 2019 and April 2021, a prospective study enrolled 248 patients with liver 
      malignancies (≤ 3 cm) that were poorly visible on B-mode US. Tumor visibility and 
      ablation feasibility were assessed using B-mode US, US-CT/MRI FI, and CEUS-CT/MRI 
      FI, and graded on a 4-point scale. CEUS was employed post-registration of US and 
      CT/MRI images, utilizing either SonoVue or Sonazoid. Comparisons between US-based 
      and CEUS-based fusion visibility and feasibility scores were undertaken using the 
      Friedman test. Moreover, rates of technical success, technique efficacy, local 
      tumor progression (LTP), and major complications were assessed. RESULTS: The 
      cohort included 223 hepatocellular carcinomas (HCCs) (89.9%) and 23 metastases 
      (9.3%), with an average tumor size of 1.6 cm. CEUS-CT/MRI FI demonstrated a 
      significant advantage in tumor visibility (3.4 ± 0.7 vs. 1.9 ± 0.6, P < 0.001) 
      and technical feasibility (3.6 ± 0.6 vs. 2.9 ± 0.8, P < 0.001) compared to US-FI. 
      In 85.5% of patients, CEUS addition to US-FI ameliorated tumor visibility. 
      Technical success was achieved in 99.6% of cases. No severe complications were 
      reported. One and two-year post CEUS-CT/MRI FI-guided RFA estimates for LTP were 
      9.3% and 10.9%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: CEUS-CT/MRI FI significantly improves 
      the visualization of tumors not discernible on B-mode US, thus augmenting 
      percutaneous RFA success and delivering improved therapeutic outcomes. TRIAL

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To compile a comprehensive national cancer registry report of Pakistan 
      by merging and analysing cancer registration data received from major functional 
      cancer registries in various parts of Pakistan. STUDY DESIGN: Observational 
      study. Place and Duration of the Study: Health Research Institute (HRI), National 
      Institutes of Health (NIH), Islamabad, from 2015-2019. METHODOLOGY: Data from 
      major cancer registries which included 'Punjab Cancer Registry (PCR), 'Karachi 
      Cancer Registry (KCR)', 'Pakistan Atomic Energy Commission (PAEC) Cancer 
      Registry', Armed Forces Institute of Pathology (AFIP) Cancer Registry, Nishtar 
      Medical University Hospital Multan (NMH), and Shifa International Hospital, 
      Islamabad (SIH) registries were pooled, cleared, and analysed at HRI. RESULTS: A 
      total of 269,707 cancer cases were analysed. Gender-wise 46.7% were males and 
      53.61% were females. As per province-wise distribution, 45.13% of cases were from 
      Punjab, 26.83% from Sindh, 16.46% from Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP), and 3.52% from 
      Baluchistan. Both genders combined, 'breast cancer' 57633 (21.4%) was the most 
      common cancer. In males, the top-5 cancers in order of frequency/percenatages 
      were 'oral' 14477 (11.6%), 'liver' 8398 (6.73%), colorectal 8024 (6.43%), 'lung' 
      7547 (6.05%) and 'prostate' 7322 (5.87% cancers). In females, causes of the 
      top-5-cancers included 'breast' 56250 (38.8%), 'ovary' 8823 (6.09%), 'oral' 7195 
      (4.97%), 'cervix' 6043 (4.17%), and 'colorectal' 4860 (3.36%) cancers. In 
      children 'Leukemia' 1626 (14.50%) and in adolescents 'Bone' 880 (14%) were the 
      leading malignancies. CONCLUSION: Breast cancer is the most common cancer in 
      females touching epidemic proportions while 'oral cancer' which is the leading 
      cancer in males ranks third in frequency in females. Like 'oral cancer' which 
      shows a strong correlation with chewing, other common cancers in Pakistan 
      including liver cancer, lung cancer, and cervical cancer are also largely 
      preventable as showed a strong correlation with hepatitis B and C, smoking, and 
      high-risk human papillomavirus. KEY WORDS: National Cancer Registry, Health

AB  - PURPOSE: To evaluate the clinical efficacy and safety of apatinib combined with 
      intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) in patients with unresectable 
      hepatocellular carcinoma (uHCC). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Open-label, single-arm, 
      exploratory clinical trial of apatinib combined with IMRT for uHCC patients. 
      Patients aged 18-75 years with adequate hematological, liver, and renal functions 
      and Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of ≤2 were 
      enrolled in this study from March 2017 to September 2020. Patients were received 
      IMRT (biological effective dose: 46-60 Gy) and continuous apatinib 
      (250-500 mg/day) oral administration until HCC progression or unacceptable toxic 
      effects. The endpoints included progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival 
      (OS), disease control rate (DCR), objective response rate (ORR), and safety. The 
      trial registration number is ChiCTR-OPC-17011890. RESULTS: A total of 33 patients 
      have taken part in the study. The median age was 58 years old (range 32-77), 27 
      (81.9%) patients were ECOG PS 0-1, and 28 (84.9%) patients were male. In 
      addition, 25 (75.7%) patients suffered from hepatitis B, 32 cases (97.0%) were in 
      Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC) Stages B-C, and eight (24.2%) had portal 
      vein involvement. Moreover, 12 (36.4%) and 21 (63.6%) patients received apatinib 
      as first-line and second or later-line therapy, respectively. The average 
      follow-up was 11.4 months, the median PFS was 7.8 months (95% confidence 
      interval: 3.9-11.7). The OS rates at 6 and 12 months were 96.7% and 66.2%. The 
      ORR and DCR were 15.1% and 81.8%, respectively. Hepatic toxicity was the most 
      common treatment-related adverse events in Grades 3-4 (12.1%). No 
      radiation-induced liver disease and Grade 5 toxicity were recorded. CONCLUSION: 
      Apatinib combined with IMRT is a safe and effective method to improve PFS and DCR 
      and has good anti-tumor activity in patients with uHCC.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Noninvasive and functional imaging of the focal liver lesion (FLL) 
      vasculature at microscopic scales is clinically challenging. We investigated the 
      feasibility of using super-resolution ultrasound (SR-US) imaging for visualizing 
      and quantifying the microvasculature of intraparenchymal FLLs. METHODS: Patients 
      with FLLs between June 2022 and February 2023 were prospectively screened. 
      Following bolus injection of microbubbles at clinical concentration, SR-US was 
      performed using a high frame rate (350-500 Hz) modified ultrasound scanner and a 
      convex array transducer with a central frequency of 3.1 MHz. RESULTS: In total, 
      47 pathologically proven FLLs at a depth of 5.7 ± 1.7 cm (mean ± standard 
      deviation) were included: 30 hepatocellular carcinomas (HCC), 11 liver metastases 
      (LM), and 6 focal nodular hyperplasias (FNH). The smallest detectable vessel size 
      of the hepatic microvasculature was 128.4 ± 18.6 μm (mean ± standard deviation) 
      at a depth of 8 cm. Significant differences were observed among the three types 
      of lesions in terms of pattern categories, vessel density, minimum flow velocity, 
      and perfusion index. We observed higher vessel density for FNH versus liver 
      parenchyma (p < 0.001) as well as fractal dimension and local flow direction 
      entropy value for FNH versus HCC (p = 0.002 and p < 0.001, respectively) and for 
      FNH versus LM (p = 0.006 and p = 0.002, respectively). CONCLUSION: 
      Multiparametric SR-US showed that these three pathological types of FLLs have 
      specific microvascular phenotypes. Vessel density, fractal dimension and local 
      flow direction entropy served as valuable parameters in distinguishing between 
      benign and malignant FLLs. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT06018142). 
      RELEVANCE STATEMENT: Multiparametric SR-US imaging offers precise morphological 
      and functional assessment of the microvasculature of intraparenchymal focal liver 
      lesions, providing insights into tumor heterogeneity and angiogenesis. KEY 
      POINTS: Super-resolution (SR)-US imaging allowed morphological and functional 
      evaluation of intraparenchymal hepatic lesion microvasculature. Hepatocellular 
      carcinoma, liver metastasis, and focal nodular hyperplasia exhibit distinct 
      microvascular architectures and hemodynamic profiles. Multiparametric 
      microvasculature characterization via SR-US imaging facilitates the 
      differentiation between benign and malignant microvascular phenotypes.

TI  - Recompensation in treatment-naïve HBV-related decompensated cirrhosis: a 5-year 
      multi-center observational study comparing patients with ascites and bleeding.
PG  - 1368-1377
LID - 10.1007/s12072-023-10579-w [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Recompensation between patients with ascites and bleeding 
      was unknown in treatment-naïve HBV-related decompensated cirrhosis. METHODS: In 
      this retrospective multi-center study, treatment-naïve HBV-related decompensated 
      patients were enrolled at first decompensating event of ascites and/or variceal 
      bleeding. Further complications and clinical characteristics were collected using 
      standard case report form every 6 months to year-5 of antiviral treatment. 
      Recompensation was defined as maintaining free of decompensation for one year and 
      achieving liver function within Child-Pugh A and/or MELD < 10. RESULTS: Totally, 
      170 (170/298, 57.0%) patients in ascites group of 298 (298/383, 77.8%) 
      treatment-naïve decompensated patients and 33 (33/85, 38.8%) in bleeding group of 
      85 (85/383, 22.2%) patients, achieved recompensation. Ascites group had higher 
      5-year rate of recompensation than bleeding group (63.3% vs. 46.5%, p = 0.012), 
      respectively. Patients achieving recompensation in ascites group maintained lower 
      rate of second decompensation than these in bleeding group (at year-5: 26.7% vs. 
      43.3%, p = 0.032). Specifically, recompensated patients in ascites group had 
      predominantly 5-year rate of further ascites (24.0%) and lower rate of further 
      bleeding (6.0%), which differed from the pattern of these in bleeding group, with 
      lower rate of further ascites (16.0%, p = 0.599) and significantly higher rate of 
      further bleeding (33.9%, p < 0.001). Both patients had superior long-term 
      prognosis (death/LT rate at year-5: 0.6% vs. 3.0%, p = 0.196). CONCLUSION: 
      Ascites patients could achieve higher rate of recompensation through antiviral 
      therapy than bleeding patients. Recompensated patients in ascites group had 
      better prognosis in terms of preventing further bleeding.

TI  - Prognostic significance of postoperative serological incomplete conversion of AFP 
      and PIVKA-II after hepatic resection for hepatocellular carcinoma: a multicenter 
      analysis of 1755 patients.
PG  - e1723-e1733
LID - 10.1093/oncolo/oyae139 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The value of serum biomarkers, particularly alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) 
      and protein induced by vitamin K absence or antagonist-II (PIVKA-II), gains 
      increasing attention in prognostic evaluation and recurrence monitoring for 
      patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). This study investigated the 
      implications of serological incomplete conversion (SIC) of these 2 biomarkers as 
      prognostic indicators for long-term outcomes after HCC resection. METHODS: A 
      multicenter observational study was conducted on a cohort of HCC patients 
      presenting with AFP (>20 ng/mL) or PIVKA-II (>40 mAU/mL) positivity who underwent 
      curative-intent resection. Based on their postoperative AFP and PIVKA-II levels 
      at first postoperative follow-up (4~8 weeks after surgery), these patients were 
      stratified into the serological incomplete conversion (SIC) and serological 
      complete conversion (SCC) groups. The study endpoints were recurrence and overall 
      survival (OS). RESULTS: Among 1755 patients, 379 and 1376 were categorized as 
      having SIC and SCC, respectively. The SIC group exhibited 1- and 5-year OS rates 
      of 67.5% and 26.3%, with the corresponding recurrence rates of 53.2% and 79.0%, 
      respectively; while the SCC group displayed 1- and 5-year OS rates of 95.8% and 
      62.5%, with the corresponding recurrence rates of 16.8% and 48.8%, respectively 
      (both P < .001). Multivariate Cox regression analysis demonstrated that 
      postoperative SIC was an independent risk factor for both increased recurrence 
      (HR: 2.40, 95% CI, 2.04-2.81, P < .001) and decreased OS (HR: 2.69, 95% CI, 
      2.24-3.24, P < .001). CONCLUSION: The results emphasize that postoperative 
      incomplete conversion of either AFP or PIVKA-II is a significant prognostic 
      marker, indicating a higher risk for adverse oncologic outcomes following HCC 
      resection. This revelation has crucial implications for refining postoperative 
      adjuvant therapy and surveillance strategies for HCC patients.

TI  - Identifying optimal candidates for post-TIPS patients with HCC undergoing TACE: a 
      multicenter observational study.
PG  - 2809-2820
LID - 10.1007/s00330-022-09249-6 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To develop a prognostic model for post-transjugular intrahepatic 
      portosystemic shunt (TIPS) patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) beyond 
      the Milan criteria treated by transarterial chemoembolization (TACE). DESIGN: 
      Between January 2013 and January 2020, 512 patients with HCC beyond the Milan 
      criteria who underwent TACE after TIPS were retrospectively recruited from 15 
      tertiary centers. Patients were randomly sorted into a training set (n = 382) and 
      a validation set (n = 130). Medical data and overall survival were assessed. A 
      prediction model was developed using multivariate Cox regression analyses. 
      Predictive performance and discrimination were evaluated and compared with other 
      prognostic models. RESULTS: Vascular invasion, log(10)(AFP), 1/creatinine, 
      extrahepatic spread, and log(10)(ALT) were the most significant prognostic 
      factors of survival. These five parameters were included in a new VACEA score. 
      This score was able to stratify patients in the training set into four distinct 
      risk grades whose median overall survival were 25.2, 15.1, 8.9, and 6.2 months, 
      respectively. The 6-month, 1-year, 2-year, and 3-year AUROC values and C-index of 
      the VACEA model were 0.819, 0.806, 0.779, 0.825, and 0.735, respectively, and 
      higher than those of other seven currently available models in both the training 
      and validation sets, as well as in different subgroups. CONCLUSION: The VACEA 
      score could stratify post-TIPS patients with HCC beyond the Milan criteria 
      treated by TACE and help to identify candidates who benefit from this treatment. 
      KEY POINTS: • Vascular invasion, AFP, creatinine, extrahepatic spread, and ALT 
      were independent significant prognostic factors of survival for HCC patients who 
      underwent TACE after TIPS. • Our new model, named VACEA score, can accurately 
      predict prognosis at the individual level and stratify patients into four 
      distinct risk grades. • The VACEA model showed better prognostic discrimination 
      and calibration than other current TACE-/TIPS-specific models Graphical abstract.

TI  - A Comparative Trial of Improving Care for Underserved Asian Americans Infected 
      with Hepatitis B Virus.
PG  - 2333-2343
LID - 10.1007/s10620-023-07840-5 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Hepatitis B virus (HBV) is the leading cause of hepatocellular 
      carcinoma (HCC). Asian Americans have the highest incidence and mortality rates 
      of HCC among all US racial/ethnic groups. Inadequate monitoring and treatment of 
      chronic hepatitis B contribute to poor health outcomes and increased healthcare 
      costs among Asian Americans. AIMS: The goal of this study is to assess the effect 
      of a patient-led strategy on chronic hepatitis B monitoring and treatment 
      adherence specifically among Asian Americans with culturally tailored Patient 
      Navigator-led Intervention. METHODS: From 2015 to 2018, 532 eligible participants 
      living with chronic hepatitis B in the greater Philadelphia and New York city 
      metropolitan areas were randomly assigned to either the intervention group or the 
      control group. Generalized linear mixed-effects models were used to estimate the 
      odds ratio (OR) for rates of doctor visits for chronic hepatitis B and rates of 
      alanine aminotransferase testing for evidence of liver damage. RESULTS: 
      Intervention group had higher rates of doctor visits than the control group at 
      both 6-month (77.22% vs. 45.75%) and 12-month assessments (90.73% vs. 60.61%). 
      Significantly more intervention group participants received ALT testing than 
      control group participants at 6-month (52.90% vs. 25.10%) and 12-month (75.40% 
      vs. 46.75%) follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: Culturally and linguistically appropriate 
      intervention has strong effects on adherence to follow-up care among Asian 
      American hepatitis B patients experiencing challenges to medication adherence and 
      follow up care. These findings further identify opportunities for practical 
      implementation of evidence-based intervention that could lead to reductions in 
      disparities in chronic liver disease and liver cancer among high-risk, 
      underserved populations.

TI  - Treatment of Moderate-to-Severe Pain in Hepatocellular Carcinoma with 
      Transcutaneous Electrical Acupoint Stimulation: A Randomized Controlled Trial.
PG  - 1583-1594
LID - 10.2147/JPR.S456874 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Moderate-to-severe pain is the most common clinical symptom in 
      patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).This trial aimed to analyze the 
      clinical efficacy of Transcutaneous electrical acupoint stimulation (TEAS) in 
      patients of HCC with severe pain and provide a reliable reference for optimizing 
      the clinical diagnostic and therapeutic strategies of HCC. METHODS: A total of 
      104 eligible patients were randomly allocated to experimental and control groups 
      in a ratio of 1:1.The treatment was administered for 1 week continuously. 
      Patients in both groups were followed up 1 week after the end of the 
      treatment.The primary outcome measure was the Numerical Rating Scale (NRS) score, 
      whereas the secondary outcome measures included Brief Pain Inventory BPI-Q3, Q4, 
      Q5 scores, analgesic dose, frequency of opioid-induced gastrointestinal side 
      effects, Karnofsky Performance Status (KPS), Quality of Life Scale - Liver Cancer 
      (QOL-LC), and Brief Fatigue Inventory (BFI) scores. RESULTS: The NRS scores of 
      experimental group was significantly lower after treatment and at the follow-up 
      than baseline (average P<0.01), there were also statistical differences between 
      the groups at the above time points (average P<0.01). BPI-Q3, -Q4, and -Q5 scores 
      in the experimental group were decreased after treatment when compared with those 
      before treatment (average P<0.01). Furthermore, there were significant 
      improvements of gastrointestinal side effects, KPS, QOL-LC and BPI in the 
      experimental group after treatment, and the above results were statistically 
      significant compared to the control group. CONCLUSION: 7-day TEAS treatment can 
      significantly enhance the analgesic effect and maintain for the following week, 
      also reduce the incidence of gastrointestinal side effects caused by opioids, and 
      improve the quality of life of patients with moderate-to-severe HCC-related pain, 
      which has reliable safety and certain clinical promotion value.

TI  - Low-energy amplitude-modulated electromagnetic field exposure: Feasibility study 
      in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma.
PG  - 12402-12412
LID - 10.1002/cam4.5944 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and poor liver 
      function lack effective systemic therapies. Low-energy electromagnetic fields 
      (EMFs) can influence cell biological processes via non-thermal effects and may 
      represent a new treatment option. METHODS: This single-site feasibility trial 
      enrolled patients with advanced HCC, Child-Pugh A and B, Eastern Cooperative 
      Oncology Group 0-2. Patients underwent 90-min amplitude-modulated EMF exposure 
      procedures every 2-4 weeks, using the AutEMdev (Autem Therapeutics). Patients 
      could also receive standard care. The primary endpoints were safety and the 
      identification of hemodynamic variability patterns. Exploratory endpoints 
      included health-related quality of life (HRQoL), overall survival (OS). and 
      objective response rate (ORR) using RECIST v1.1. RESULTS: Sixty-six patients with 
      advanced HCC received 539 AutEMdev procedures (median follow-up, 30 months). No 
      serious adverse events occurred during procedures. Self-limiting grade 1 
      somnolence occurred in 78.7% of patients. Hemodynamic variability during EMF 
      exposure was associated with specific amplitude-modulation frequencies. HRQoL was 
      maintained or improved among patients remaining on treatment. Median OS was 
      11.3 months (95% confidence interval [CI]: 6.0, 16.6) overall (16.0 months [95% 
      CI: 4.4, 27.6] and 12.0 months [6.4, 17.6] for combination therapy and 
      monotherapy, respectively). ORR was 24.3% (32% and 17% for combination therapy 
      and monotherapy, respectively). CONCLUSION: AutEMdev EMF exposure has an 
      excellent safety profile in patients with advanced HCC. Hemodynamic alterations 
      at personalized frequencies may represent a surrogate of anti-tumor efficacy.

AB  - Protein induced by vitamin K absence or antagonist II (PIVKA-II) plays a critical 
      role in the diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), however, studies on its 
      efficacy in diagnosing recurrent HCC were rarely found. A multicenter, 
      retrospective, and observational study was conducted. During the overall 
      follow-up of 5 years, HCC patients who had curative resection were monitored 
      every 3 months in the first year post-surgery and every 6 months thereafter if no 
      recurrence occurred. Tumor markers were collected at the diagnosis of recurrence 
      for those with recurrence and at the last follow-up for those without recurrence. 
      The median serum levels of PIVKA-II and AFP in the recurrence group were 
      significantly higher than those in the non-recurrence group (PIVKA-II: 84.62 vs. 
      18.76 mAU/ml, p < 0.001; AFP: 4.90 vs. 3.00 ng/ml, p < 0.001) and there is a 
      significant correlation between PIVKA-II and AFP (R = 0.901, p < 0.001). PIVKA-II 
      showed better accuracy than AFP in the diagnosis of overall recurrent HCC (AUC: 
      0.883 vs. 0.672; p < 0.0001), but also in patients with negative PIVKA-II before 
      curative resection (AUC: 0.878 vs. 0.680, p = 0.001). Clinician should pay more 
      attention to serum PIVKA-II values when following patients after curative HCC 
      resection to detect early recurrence.Clinical trial registration:

TI  - Nomogram based on liver stiffness and spleen area with ultrasound for 
      posthepatectomy liver failure: A multicenter study.
PG  - 3314-3325
LID - 10.3748/wjg.v30.i27.3314 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Liver stiffness (LS) measurement with two-dimensional shear wave 
      elastography (2D-SWE) correlates with the degree of liver fibrosis and thus 
      indirectly reflects liver function reserve. The size of the spleen increases due 
      to tissue proliferation, fibrosis, and portal vein congestion, which can 
      indirectly reflect the situation of liver fibrosis/cirrhosis. It was reported 
      that the size of the spleen was related to posthepatectomy liver failure (PHLF). 
      So far, there has been no study combining 2D-SWE measurements of LS with spleen 
      size to predict PHLF. This prospective study aimed to investigate the utility of 
      2D-SWE assessing LS and spleen area (SPA) for the prediction of PHLF in 
      hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients and to develop a risk prediction model. 
      AIM: To investigate the utility of 2D-SWE assessing LS and SPA for the prediction 
      of PHLF in HCC patients and to develop a risk prediction model. METHODS: This was 
      a multicenter observational study prospectively analyzing patients who underwent 
      hepatectomy from October 2020 to March 2022. Within 1 wk before partial 
      hepatectomy, ultrasound examination was performed to measure LS and SPA, and 
      blood was drawn to evaluate the patient's liver function and other conditions. 
      Least absolute shrinkage and selection operator logistic regression and 
      multivariate logistic regression analysis was applied to identify independent 
      predictors of PHLF and develop a nomogram. Nomogram performance was validated 
      further. The diagnostic performance of the nomogram was evaluated with receiver 
      operating characteristic curve compared with the conventional models, including 
      the model for end-stage liver disease (MELD) score and the albumin-bilirubin 
      (ALBI) score. RESULTS: A total of 562 HCC patients undergoing hepatectomy (500 in 
      the training cohort and 62 in the validation cohort) were enrolled in this study. 
      The independent predictors of PHLF were LS, SPA, range of resection, blood loss, 
      international normalized ratio, and total bilirubin. Better diagnostic 
      performance of the nomogram was obtained in the training [area under receiver 
      operating characteristic curve (AUC): 0.833; 95% confidence interval (95%CI): 
      0.792-0.873; sensitivity: 83.1%; specificity: 73.5%] and validation (AUC: 0.802; 
      95%CI: 0.684-0.920; sensitivity: 95.5%; specificity: 52.5%) cohorts compared with 
      the MELD score and the ALBI score. CONCLUSION: This PHLF nomogram, mainly based 
      on LS by 2D-SWE and SPA, was useful in predicting PHLF in HCC patients and 
      presented better than MELD score and ALBI score.

TI  - Real-world evidence of sorafenib for the treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma: A 
      single-center study.
PG  - 1345-1349
LID - 10.4103/jcrt.jcrt_308_21 [doi]
AB  - CONTEXT: Hepatocellular carcinoma is the third leading cause of cancer death. 
      Currently, sorafenib is the treatment of choice in advanced hepatocarcinoma. 
      AIMS: Assessing the effectiveness and toxicity of sorafenib in real-word clinical 
      practice in patients with hepatocarcinoma. SETTINGS AND DESIGN: Single-centered 
      observational retrospective study. METHODS AND MATERIAL: We included patients 
      with hepatocarcinoma who began treatment with sorafenib between 2008 and 2018. We 
      evaluated overall survival, time to progression, and response using RECIST 
      (Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors) criteria. Toxicity was assessed 
      according to the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 5. 2020. 
      STATISTICAL ANALYSIS USED: Kaplan-Meier curves and the log-rank test were used to 
      determine the survival time and estimate factors associated with these events. 
      Data were analyzed with SPSS 19.0 software. RESULTS: We included 36 patients 
      (88.9% male) with an average age of 64 ± 3.4 years. The tumor stage was advanced 
      (C) in 21 patients (61.8%). We obtained a median overall survival of 8.5 months 
      (IQR 3.14-18.9) and a time to progression of 4.5 months (IQR 2.4-8.8). The main 
      degree of response was progression in 19 patients (36.1%), followed by stable 
      disease in 13 (52.8%). The most commonly reported adverse reactions were: 
      constitutional (83.3%), gastrointestinal (55%) and dermatological symptoms 
      (50.0%). The development of grades 3 or 4 toxicity was not associated with 
      increased overall survival (P = 0.719). CONCLUSIONS: The findings of the survival 
      analysis obtained in real practice are similar to those obtained in pivotal 
      clinical trials. Adverse reactions were different from those expected.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a leading cause of cancer-related 
      death in China. The combination of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) and 
      antiangiogenic drugs, such as bevacizumab and tyrosine kinase inhibitors, has 
      been recommended as first-line treatment for advanced HCC. However, two-thirds of 
      patients did not benefit from this form of immunotherapy. Currently, data on the 
      subsequent regimen for patients previously treated with ICIs are lacking. Studies 
      have shown that the combination of radiotherapy (RT) and ICIs is a potentially 
      effective second-line therapy for HCC. This study aims to assess the efficacy and 
      safety of combined therapy with stereotactic body RT (SBRT), sintilimab and 
      IBI305 (a biosimilar of bevacizumab) in patients with HCC following the 
      progression of first-line ICI therapy. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: This study is an 
      open-label, single-arm, single-centre, phase 2 trial of 21 patients with advanced 
      HCC in whom previous ICI therapy has failed. Participants will receive 
      approximately 30-40 Gy/5-8F SBRT, followed by 200 mg sintilimab and 15 mg/kg 
      IBI305 intravenously every 3 weeks. Treatment will continue until the development 
      of unacceptable toxicity or disease progression. We will use Simon's two-stage 
      design, with the objective response rate (ORR) as the primary endpoint. Secondary 
      endpoints include ORR of lesions without RT, disease control rate, 
      progression-free survival, overall survival and safety. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: 
      The study was authorised by the Medical Ethics Committee. Dissemination of 
      results will occur via a peer-reviewed publication and other relevant media.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Multidisciplinary team meetings (MDMs), also known as tumor 
      conferences, are a cornerstone of cancer treatments. However, barriers such as 
      incomplete patient information or logistical challenges can postpone tumor board 
      decisions and delay patient treatment, potentially affecting clinical outcomes. 
      Therapeutic Assistance and Decision algorithms for hepatobiliary tumor Boards 
      (ADBoard) aims to reduce this delay by providing automated data extraction and 
      high-quality, evidence-based treatment recommendations. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: 
      With the help of natural language processing, relevant patient information will 
      be automatically extracted from electronic medical records and used to complete a 
      classic tumor conference protocol. A machine learning model is trained on 
      retrospective MDM data and clinical guidelines to recommend treatment options for 
      patients in our inclusion criteria. Study participants will be randomized to 
      either MDM with ADBoard (Arm A: MDM-AB) or conventional MDM (Arm B: MDM-C). The 
      concordance of recommendations of both groups will be compared using interrater 
      reliability. We hypothesize that the therapy recommendations of ADBoard would be 
      in high agreement with those of the MDM-C, with a Cohen's kappa value of ≥ 0.75. 
      Furthermore, our secondary hypotheses state that the completeness of patient 
      information presented in MDM is higher when using ADBoard than without, and the 
      explainability of tumor board protocols in MDM-AB is higher compared to MDM-C as 
      measured by the System Causability Scale. DISCUSSION: The implementation of 
      ADBoard aims to improve the quality and completeness of the data required for MDM 
      decision-making and to propose therapeutic recommendations that consider current 
      medical evidence and guidelines in a transparent and reproducible manner. ETHICS 
      AND DISSEMINATION: The project was approved by the Ethics Committee of the 
      Charité - Universitätsmedizin Berlin. REGISTRATION DETAILS: The study was 
      registered on ClinicalTrials.gov (trial identifying number: NCT05681949; 
      https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT05681949 ) on 12 January 2023.

TI  - Prediction of therapeutic response of unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma to 
      hepatic arterial infusion chemotherapy based on pretherapeutic MRI radiomics and 
      Albumin-Bilirubin score.
PG  - 5181-5192
LID - 10.1007/s00432-022-04467-3 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: To construct and validate a combined nomogram model based on magnetic 
      resonance imaging (MRI) radiomics and Albumin-Bilirubin (ALBI) score to predict 
      therapeutic response in unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients 
      treated with hepatic arterial infusion chemotherapy (HAIC). METHODS: The 
      retrospective study was conducted on 112 unresectable HCC patients who underwent 
      pretherapeutic MRI examinations. Patients were randomly divided into training 
      (n = 79) and validation cohorts (n = 33). A total of 396 radiomics features were 
      extracted from the volume of interest of the primary lesion by the Artificial Kit 
      software. The least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression 
      was applied to identify optimal radiomic features. After feature selection, three 
      models, including the clinical, radiomics, and combined models, were developed to 
      predict the non-response of unresectable HCC to HAIC treatment. The performance 
      of these models was evaluated by the receiver operating characteristic curve. 
      According to the most efficient model, a nomogram was established, and the 
      performance of which was also assessed by calibration curve and decision curve 
      analysis. Kaplan-Meier curve and log-rank test were performed to evaluate the 
      Progression-free survival (PFS). RESULTS: Using the LASSO regression, we 
      ultimately selected three radiomics features from T2-weighted images to construct 
      the radiomics score (Radscore). Only the ALBI score was an independent factor 
      associated with non-response in the clinical model (P = 0.033). The combined 
      model, which included the ALBI score and Radscore, achieved better performance in 
      the prediction of non-response, with an AUC of 0.79 (95% CI 0.68-0.90) and 0.75 
      (95% CI 0.58-0.92) in the training and validation cohorts, respectively. The 
      nomogram based on the combined model also had good discrimination and calibration 
      (P = 0.519 for the training cohort and P = 0.389 for the validation cohort). The 
      Kaplan-Meier analysis also demonstrate that the high-score patients had 
      significantly shorter PFS than the low-score patients (P = 0.031) in the combined 
      model, with median PFS 6.0 vs 9.0 months. CONCLUSION: The nomogram based on the 
      combined model consisting of MRI radiomics and ALBI score could be used as a 
      biomarker to predict the therapeutic response of unresectable HCC after HAIC.

TI  - Model-Informed Assessment of Probability of Phase 3 Success for Ritlecitinib in 
      Patients with Moderate-to-Severe Ulcerative Colitis.
PG  - 724-735
LID - 10.1002/cpt.3251 [doi]
AB  - Ritlecitinib, an oral Janus kinase 3/tyrosine kinase expressed in hepatocellular 
      carcinoma family inhibitor, was evaluated in patients with ulcerative colitis 
      (UC) in a phase 2b trial. Model-informed drug development strategies were applied 
      to bridge observations from phase 2b to predictions for a proposed phase 3 study 
      design to assess the probability of achieving the target efficacy outcome. A 
      longitudinal exposure-response model of the time course of the 4 Mayo subscores 
      (rectal bleeding, stool frequency, physician's global assessment, and endoscopic 
      subscore) in patients with UC receiving placebo or ritlecitinib was developed 
      using population modeling approaches and an item response theory framework. The 
      quantitative relationships between the 4 Mayo subscores accommodated the 
      prediction of composite endpoints such as total Mayo score and partial Mayo score 
      (key endpoints from phase 2b), and modified clinical remission and endoscopic 
      remission (proposed phase 3 endpoints). Clinical trial simulations using the 
      final model assessed the probability of candidate ritlecitinib dosing regimens 
      (including those tested in phase 2b and alternative) and phase 3 study designs 
      for achieving target efficacy outcomes benchmarked against an approved treatment 
      for moderate-to-severe UC. The probabilities of achieving target modified 
      clinical remission and endoscopic improvement outcomes at both weeks 8 and 52 for 
      ritlecitinib 100 mg once daily was 74.8%. Model-based assessment mitigated some 
      of the risk associated with proceeding to pivotal phase 3 trials with dosing 
      regimens of which there was limited clinical experience.

TI  - Perioperative and Disease-Free Survival Outcomes after Hepatectomy for Centrally 
      Located Hepatocellular Carcinoma Guided by Augmented Reality and Indocyanine 
      Green Fluorescence Imaging: A Single-Center Experience.
PG  - 328-337
LID - 10.1097/XCS.0000000000000472 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Laparoscopic hepatectomy for centrally located hepatocellular 
      carcinoma is challenging to perform. Augmented reality navigation (ARN) and 
      fluorescence imaging are currently safe and reproducible techniques for 
      hepatectomy, but the efficacy results for centrally located hepatocellular 
      carcinoma have not been reported. This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy of an 
      ARN system combined with fluorescence imaging (ARN-FI) in laparoscopic 
      hepatectomy for centrally located hepatocellular carcinoma. STUDY DESIGN: This 
      was a post hoc analysis of an original nonrandomized clinical trial that was 
      designed to evaluate the feasibility and efficacy of ARN-FI for laparoscopic 
      liver resection. A total of 76 patients were consecutively enrolled from June 
      2018 to June 2021, of which 42 underwent laparoscopic hepatectomy using ARN-FI 
      (ARN-FI group), and the other 34 who did not use ARN-FI guidance (non-ARN-FI 
      group). Perioperative outcomes and disease-free survival were compared between 
      the 2 groups. RESULTS: Compared with the non-ARN-FI group, the ARN-FI group had 
      less intraoperative blood loss (median 275 vs 300 mL, p = 0.013), lower 
      intraoperative transfusion rate (14.3% vs 64.7%, p < 0.01), shorter postoperative 
      hospital stay (median 8 vs 9 days, p = 0.005), and lower postoperative 
      complication rate (35.7% vs 61.8%, p = 0.024). There was no death in the 
      perioperative period and follow-up period. There was no significant difference in 
      overall disease-free survival between the 2 groups (p = 0.16). CONCLUSIONS: The 
      ARN system and fluorescence imaging may be of value in improving the success rate 
      of surgery, reducing postoperative complications, accelerating postoperative 
      recovery, and shortening postoperative hospital stay.

AB  - Background: Programmed cell death protein-1 inhibitors combined with lenvatinib 
      have become a popular treatment option for patients with unresectable 
      hepatocellular carcinoma. Transarterial chemoembolization combined with 
      programmed cell death protein-1 inhibitors and lenvatinib has also shown 
      preliminary efficacy in the unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma. We conducted 
      this observational, retrospective, cohort study to compare the clinical outcomes 
      and safety of transarterial chemoembolization combined with programmed cell death 
      protein-1 inhibitors plus lenvatinib versus programmed cell death protein-1 
      inhibitors plus lenvatinib in patients with unresectable hepatocellular 
      carcinoma. Methods: Between November 2019 and November 2021, patients who were 
      diagnosed with unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma and received transarterial 
      chemoembolization combined with programmed cell death protein-1 inhibitors plus 
      lenvatinib or programmed cell death protein-1 inhibitors plus lenvatinib 
      treatment were reviewed for eligibility. The primary endpoints included objective 
      response rate, overall survival, and progression-free survival. The secondary 
      endpoint was the frequency of key adverse events. Results: In total, 105 patients 
      were eligible for the present study, and they were divided into the transarterial 
      chemoembolization combined with programmed cell death protein-1 inhibitors plus 
      lenvatinib group (n = 46) and the programmed cell death protein-1 inhibitors plus 
      lenvatinib group (n = 59). The patient cohort after a one-to-one propensity score 
      matching (n = 86) was also analyzed. The transarterial chemoembolization combined 
      with programmed cell death protein-1 inhibitors plus lenvatinib group had a 
      higher objective response rate both in the patient cohort before propensity score 
      matching (54.3% vs 25.4%, P = .002) and after propensity score matching (55.8% vs 
      30.2%, P = .017). The patients in the transarterial chemoembolization combined 
      with programmed cell death protein-1 inhibitors plus lenvatinib group had 
      prolonged overall survival (median, 20.5 vs 12.6 months, P = .015) and 
      progression-free survival (median, 10.2 vs 7.4 months, P = .035). For patient 
      cohort- propensity score matching, the overall survival (20.5 vs 12.8 months, 
      P = .013) and progression-free survival (12.1 vs 7.8 months, P = .030) were also 
      significantly better in the transarterial chemoembolization combined with 
      programmed cell death protein-1 inhibitors plus lenvatinib group than in the 
      programmed cell death protein-1 inhibitors plus lenvatinib group. There were no 
      significant differences between the 2 groups concerning adverse reactions caused 
      by immunotherapy and lenvatinib. The adverse reactions caused by transarterial 
      chemoembolization were transient and were quickly reversed. Conclusions: Compared 
      to programmed cell death protein-1 inhibitors plus lenvatinib, transarterial 
      chemoembolization combined with programmed cell death protein-1 inhibitors plus 
      lenvatinib may provide better treatment response and survival benefits for 
      patients with unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma, and the adverse events were 
      manageable.

AB  - PURPOSE: Our study aimed to evaluate the impact of concomitant medications on the 
      response and survival of patients with advanced digestive tract cancer receiving 
      an immunotherapy-antiangiogenesis combination. METHODS: We conducted a 
      three-center observational retrospective study of patients with advanced 
      digestive tract cancer who received programmed death-1 (PD-1) inhibitors plus 
      antiangiogenic agents between March 2019 and July 2022 in China. The patients had 
      one of the three types of primary tumors: hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), 
      colorectal cancer (CRC), and gastric cancer (GC). RESULTS: The study included 352 
      patients. The most frequently prescribed co-medications were nonsteroidal 
      anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) (46.3%), proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) (38.0%), 
      systemic antibiotics (33.8%), and corticosteroids (30.1%). Probiotics had a 
      direct correlation with a higher objective response rate (ORR) (OR 2.4, 95% CI 
      1.2 to 4.7, p = 0.013). Patients who received PPIs for gastritis/gastroesophageal 
      reflux disease (GERD) (HR 0.7, 95% CI 0.5 to 1.0, p = 0.045), anticoagulants (HR 
      0.5, 95% CI 0.3 to 0.9, p = 0.009), and probiotics (HR 0.7, 95% CI 0.5 to 1.0, 
      p = 0.034) had longer progression-free survival (PFS). Patients who received PPIs 
      for gastritis/GERD (HR 0.6, 95% CI 0.4 to 0.9; p = 0.009) had longer overall 
      survival (OS), while patients receiving opioids (HR 1.5, 95% CI 1.1 to 2.0, 
      p = 0.010) had a significantly higher risk of death. CONCLUSION: Patients with 
      advanced digestive tract cancer who were administered PPIs for gastritis/GERD 
      indication, anticoagulants, or probiotics in combination with PD-1 inhibitors and 
      antiangiogenic agents experienced improved clinical outcomes. However, opioid 
      administration was linked to reduced OS in patients receiving combined therapy.

AB  - PURPOSE: To establish and validate a multiparameter prediction model for early 
      recurrence after radical resection in patients diagnosed with combined 
      hepatocellular-cholangiocarcinoma (cHCC-CC). MATERIALS AND METHODS: This study 
      reviewed the clinical characteristics and preoperative CT images of 143 cHCC-CC 
      patients who underwent radical resection from three institutions. A total of 110 
      patients from institution 1 were randomly divided into training set (n = 78) and 
      testing set (n = 32) in the ratio of 7-3. Univariate and multivariate logistic 
      regression analysis were used to construct a nomogram prediction model in the 
      training set, which was internally and externally validated in the testing set 
      and the validation set (n = 33) from institutions 2 and 3. The area under the 
      curve (AUC) of receiver operating characteristics (ROC), decision curve analysis 
      (DCA), and calibration analysis were used to evaluate the model's performance. 
      RESULTS: The combined model demonstrated superior predictive performance compared 
      to the clinical model, the CT model, the pathological model and the clinic-CT 
      model in predicting the early postoperative recurrence. The nomogram based on the 
      combined model included AST, ALP, tumor size, tumor margin, arterial phase 
      peritumoral enhancement, and MVI (Microvascular invasion). The model had AUCs of 
      0.89 (95% CI 0.81-0.96), 0.85 (95% CI 0.70-0.99), and 0.86 (95% CI 0.72-1.00) in 
      the training, testing, and validation sets, respectively, indicating high 
      predictive power. DCA showed that the combined model had good clinical value and 
      correction effect. CONCLUSION: A nomogram incorporating clinical characteristics 
      and preoperative CT features can be utilized to effectively predict the early 
      postoperative recurrence in patients with cHCC-CC.

TI  - Exposure-response analysis for nivolumab plus ipilimumab combination therapy in 
      patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (CheckMate 040).
PG  - 1445-1457

AB  - This analysis was conducted to inform dose selection of a combination of 
      nivolumab plus ipilimumab for the treatment of sorafenib-experienced patients 
      with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). CheckMate 040 is an open-label, multicohort, 
      phase I/II trial in adults with advanced HCC that evaluated nivolumab monotherapy 
      (0.1-10 mg/kg once every 2 weeks [q2w]) and the following three combinations of 
      nivolumab plus ipilimumab: (1) nivolumab 1 mg/kg plus ipilimumab 3 mg/kg every 
      3 weeks (q3w) for four doses, followed by nivolumab monotherapy 240 mg q2w (arm 
      A); (2) nivolumab 3 mg/kg plus ipilimumab 1 mg/kg q3w for four doses, followed by 
      nivolumab monotherapy 240 mg q2w (arm B); and (3) nivolumab 3 mg/kg q2w plus 
      ipilimumab 1 mg/kg every 6 weeks continuously (arm C). Exposure-response 
      relationships (efficacy and safety) were characterized using nivolumab and 
      ipilimumab concentrations after the first dose (Cavg1) as the exposure measure. 
      Objective tumor response (OTR) and overall survival (OS) improvements were 
      associated with increased ipilimumab exposure (OTR: odds ratio 1.45, 95% 
      confidence interval [CI], 1.13-1.86; OS: hazard ratio 0.86, 95% CI 0.75-0.98), 
      but not nivolumab exposure (OTR: odds ratio 0.99, 95% CI 0.97-1.02; OS: hazard 
      ratio 1.08, 95% CI 0.89-1.32). Hepatic treatment-related and immune-mediated 
      adverse events were more common in arm A than in arms B or C. Nivolumab 1 mg/kg 
      plus ipilimumab 3 mg/kg q3w for four doses, followed by nivolumab monotherapy 
      240 mg q2w had the most favorable benefit:risk profile in patients with advanced 
      HCC.

TI  - Cidan Capsule in Combination with Adjuvant Transarterial Chemoembolization 
      Reduces Recurrence Rate after Curative Resection of Hepatocellular Carcinoma: A 
      Multicenter, Randomized Controlled Trial.
PG  - 3-9
LID - 10.1007/s11655-022-3537-4 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of Cidan Capsule combined with 
      adjuvant transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) in patients with a high risk of 
      early recurrence after curative resection of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). 
      METHODS: A multicenter, randomized controlled trial was conducted in patients 
      with high-risk recurrence factors after curative resection of HCC from 9 medical 
      centers between July 2014 and July 2018. Totally 249 patients were randomly 
      assigned to TACE with or without Cidan Capsule administration groups by 
      stratified block in a 1:1 ratio. Postoperative adjuvant TACE was given 4-5 weeks 
      after hepatic resection in both groups. Additionally, 125 patients in the TACE 
      plus Cidan group were administrated Cidan Capsule (0.27 g/capsule, 5 capsules 
      every time, 4 times a day) for 6 months with a 24-month follow-up. Primary 
      endpoints included disease-free survival (DFS) and tumor recurrence rate (TRR). 
      Secondary endpoint was overall survival (OS). Any drug-related adverse events 
      (AEs) were observed and recorded. RESULTS: As the data cutoff in July 9th, 2018, 
      the median DFS was not reached in the TACE plus Cidan group and 234.0 days in the 
      TACE group (hazard ratio, 0.420, 95% confidence interval, 0.290-0.608; P<0.01). 
      The 1- and 2-year TRR in the TACE plus Cidan and TACE groups were 31.5%, 37.1%, 
      and 60.8%, 63.4%, respectively (P<0.01). Median OS was not reached in both 
      groups. The 1- and 2-year OS rates in TACE plus Cidan and TACE groups were 98.4%, 
      98.4%, and 89.5%, 87.9%, respectively (P<0.05). The most common grade 3-4 AEs 
      included fatigue, abdominal pain, lumbar pain, and nausea. One serious AE was 
      reported in 1 patient in the TACE plus Cidan group, the death was due to 
      retroperitoneal mass hemorrhage and hemorrhagic shock, and was not related to 
      study drug. CONCLUSIONS: Cidan Capsule in combination with TACE can reduce the 
      incidence of early recurrence in HCC patients at high-risk of recurrence after 
      radical hepatectomy and may be an appropriate option in postoperative 
      anti-recurrence treatment. (Registration No. NCT02253511).

AB  - BACKGROUND: GT90001 (also known as PF-03446962) is an anti-ALK-1 monoclonal 
      antibody and has shown activity in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). This phase 
      1b/2 study was designed to determine the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) of 
      GT90001 plus nivolumab, and assess the safety and anti-tumor activity in patients 
      with advanced HCC. METHODS: Patients with advanced HCC were recruited from 3 
      centers. Eligible patients in the dose de-escalation stage received the GT90001 
      on day 1 of a 14-day cycle in a rolling-six design with a fixed dose of nivolumab 
      (3.0 mg/kg). Patients in dose-expansion stage received the RP2D of GT90001 plus 
      nivolumab. Primary endpoint was safety. Key secondary endpoint was objective 
      response rate (ORR) as per RECIST 1.1. RESULTS: Between July 9, 2019, and August 
      8, 2022, 20 patients were treated (6 in phase 1b; 14 in phase 2) and evaluable 
      for analysis. In phase 1b, no dose-limiting toxicities were observed, and GT90001 
      7.0 mg/kg was confirmed as the RP2D. Common grade 3/4 adverse events (AEs) were 
      platelet count decreased (15%). No deaths due to AEs were reported. Confirmed ORR 
      and disease control rate were 30% (95% CI, 14.6%-51.9%) and 40% (95% CI, 
      21.9%-61.3%), respectively. Median duration of response was not calculated (95% 
      CI, 7.39 months to not calculated). Median progression-free survival (PFS) was 
      2.81 months (95% CI, 1.71-9.33), with 6-month and 12-month PFS rates of 35% and 
      25%, respectively. One patient with multiple intra- and extra-hepatic metastases 
      was diagnosed with pseudo-progression upon GT90001 plus nivolumab exposure. 
      CONCLUSIONS: GT90001 plus nivolumab has a manageable safety profile and promising 
      anti-tumor activity in patients with advanced HCC. TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: 
      ClinicalTrials.gov identifier NCT03893695.

TI  - Phase I Trial of a Therapeutic DNA Vaccine for Preventing Hepatocellular 
      Carcinoma from Chronic Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) Infection.
PG  - 163-173

AB  - Chronic hepatitis C can lead to cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. We 
      studied the safety and immunogenicity of a novel therapeutic hepatitis C virus 
      (HCV) genotype 1a/1b consensus DNA vaccine, INO-8000, encoding HCV NS3, NS4A, 
      NS4B, and NS5A proteins alone or co-administered with DNA-encoding IL12 
      (INO-9012), a human cytokine that stimulates cellular immune function, in 
      individuals with chronic hepatitis C. This was a phase I, multisite 
      dose-escalation trial with an expansion cohort evaluating doses of 0, 0.3, 1.0, 
      and 3.0 mg of INO-9012 (IL12 DNA) as an addition to 6.0 mg of (INO-8000; HCV DNA 
      vaccine). Vaccines were administered by intramuscular injection followed by 
      electroporation at study entry and at weeks 4, 12, and 24. HCV-specific CD4+ and 
      CD8+ T-cell immune responses were measured by IFNγ ELISpot and flow 
      cytometry-based assays. Transient, mild-to-moderate injection site reactions 
      unrelated to IL12 DNA dose were common. Increases in HCV-specific IFNγ production 
      occurred in 15/20 (75%) participants. Increases in the frequency of HCV-specific 
      CD4+ and CD8+ T cells occurred at all dose levels, with the greatest increases 
      seen at 1.0 mg of INO-9012. HCV-specific CD8+ and CD4+ T-cell activities 
      increased in 16/18 (89%) and 14/17 (82%) participants with available data, 
      respectively. The vaccine regimen was safe and induced HCV-specific CD4+ and CD8+ 
      cellular immune responses of modest magnitude in most HCV-infected participants. 
      The addition of 1.0 mg of IL12 DNA provided the best enhancement of immune 
      responses. The vaccine regimen had little effect on controlling HCV viremia. 
      PREVENTION RELEVANCE: The administration of IL12 DNA along with a hepatitis C 
      viral antigen DNA vaccine enhanced the HCV-specific immune responses induced by 
      the vaccine in individuals with chronic hepatitis C, an important cause of 
      hepatocellular carcinoma. IL12 could be an effective adjuvant in vaccines 
      targeting HCV and other oncogenic viruses.

TI  - Comparison of CalliSpheres(®) microspheres drug-eluting beads and conventional 
      transarterial chemoembolization in hepatocellular carcinoma patients: a 
      randomized controlled trial.
PG  - 70-79
LID - 10.2478/raon-2023-0001 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: This trial aimed to compare the outcomes of drug-eluting beads 
      transarterial chemoembolization (DEB-TACE) with CalliSpheres(®) microspheres 
      (CSM) and conventional transarterial chemoembolization cTACE in the treatment of 
      patients with unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). PATIENTS AND METHODS: 
      A total of 90 patients were divided into DEB-TACE group (n = 45) and cTACE group 
      (n = 45). The treatment response, overall survival (OS), progression-free 
      survival (PFS), and the safety were compared between the two groups. RESULTS: The 
      objective response rate (ORR) in the DEB-TACE group was significantly higher than 
      that in cTACE group at 1, 3, and 6 months of follow-up (P = 0.031, P = 0.003, P = 
      0.002). The complete response (CR) in DEB-TACE group was significantly higher 
      than that in cTACE group at 3 months (P = 0.036). Survival analysis revealed 
      that, DEB-TACE group had better survival benefits than cTACE group (median OS: 
      534 days vs. 367 days, P = 0.027; median PFS: 352 days vs. 278 days P = 0.004). 
      The degree of liver function injury was more serious in DEB-TACE group at 1 week, 
      but was similar between the two groups at 1 month. DEB-TACE with CSM caused a 
      high incidence of fever and a severe abdominal pain (P = 0.031, P = 0.037). 
      CONCLUSIONS: DEB-TACE with CSM showed better treatment response and survival 
      benefits than cTACE group. Although a transient more severe liver damage, high 
      incidence of fever and a severe abdominal pain occurred in the DEB-TACE group, it 
      could be resolved through symptomatic treatment.

TI  - The effects of high-intensity interval training and Iranian propolis extract on 
      serum levels of TRPV4 and CYP2E1 proteins in patients with nonalcoholic fatty 
      liver.
PG  - 19-25
LID - 10.62438/tunismed.v102i1.4669 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is the most common cause 
      of liver failure, fibrosis, cirrhosis, and liver cancer, which can eventually 
      lead to death. AIM: To investigate the effects of high-intensity interval 
      training (HIIT) and iranian propolis extract on serum levels of transient 
      receptor potential cation channel subfamily V member 4 (TRPV4) and cytochrome 
      P450 2E1 (CYP2E1) proteins in patients with NAFLD. METHODS: Thirty-two patients 
      with NAFLD (mean±standard deviation of age: 45.1±3.6 years; body mass index: 
      30.0±3.6 kg/m2) were assigned in a randomized control trial to one of the 
      following groups: HIIT (n=8), propolis supplement (n=8), propolis + HIIT (n=8), 
      and controls (n=8). The subjects participated in eight weeks of HIIT (one bout of 
      1-min intervals at 80-95% of the maximal heart-rate, interspersed by two min at 
      50-55% of the reserve heart-rate). The Propolis supplement was taken three times 
      a day by the patients in the form of 50 mg tablet after the main meals. Body 
      composition, liver injury test (eg; Alanine- and Aspartate- aminotransferase 
      levels), liver ultrasound and serum levels of TRPV4 and CYP2E1 were measured 
      before and after intervention. One-way analysis of variance was used to compare 
      post-tests among the groups. RESULTS: HIIT significantly reduced serum levels of 
      TRPV4 protein (p=0.001). The reduction in CYP2E1 was not significant in HIIT 
      group (p=0.075). Propolis consumption had no significant effect on serum levels 
      of CYP2E1 protein (p=0.059), and TRPV4 (p=0.072). There was a significant 
      decrease in TRPV4 and CYP2E1 in the HIIT (p=0.001) and propolis supplement 
      (p=0.032) groups. CONCLUSION: HIIT and propolis supplementation can be used to 
      reduce TRPV4 and CYP2E1, which in turn reduces oxidative stress and inflammation 
      in patients with NAFLD.

OAB - Introduction: Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is the most common cause 
      of liver failure, fibrosis, cirrhosis, and liver cancer, which can eventually 
      lead to death. Aim: To investigate the effects of high-intensity interval 
      training (HIIT) and iranian propolis extract on serum levels of transient 
      receptor potential cation channel subfamily V member 4 (TRPV4) and cytochrome 
      P450 2E1 (CYP2E1) proteins in patients with NAFLD. Methods: Thirty-two patients 
      with NAFLD (mean±standard deviation of age: 45.1±3.6 years; body mass index: 
      30.0±3.6 kg/m2) were assigned in a randomized control trial to one of the 
      following groups: HIIT (n=8), propolis supplement (n=8), propolis + HIIT (n=8), 
      and controls (n=8). The subjects participated in eight weeks of HIIT (one bout of 
      1-min intervals at 80-95% of the maximal heart-rate, interspersed by two min at 
      50-55% of the reserve heart-rate). The Propolis supplement was taken three times 
      a day by the patients in the form of 50 mg tablet after the main meals. Body 
      composition, liver injury test (eg; Alanine- and Aspartate- aminotransferase 
      levels), liver ultrasound and serum levels of TRPV4 and CYP2E1 were measured 
      before and after intervention. One-way analysis of variance was used to compare 
      post-tests among the groups. Results: HIIT significantly reduced serum levels of 
      TRPV4 protein (p=0.001). The reduction in CYP2E1 was not significant in HIIT 
      group (p=0.075). Propolis consumption had no significant effect on serum levels 
      of CYP2E1 protein (p=0.059), and TRPV4 (p=0.072). There was a significant 
      decrease in TRPV4 and CYP2E1 in the HIIT (p=0.001) and propolis supplement 
      (p=0.032) groups. Conclusion: HIIT and propolis supplementation can be used to 
      reduce TRPV4 and CYP2E1, which in turn reduces oxidative stress and inflammation 
      in patients with NAFLD.

TI  - Prognostic Significance of Recurrence and Timing of Recurrence on Survival Among 
      Patients with Early-Stage Hepatocellular Carcinoma in U.S. Clinical Practice.
PG  - 1054-1062
LID - 10.1245/s10434-024-16476-2 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Many patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) experience 
      recurrence after curative-intent resection or ablation, with a poor prognosis. 
      Real-world patterns of recurrence and the prognostic significance of early 
      recurrence in U.S. clinical practice have not been well characterized. METHODS: 
      This retrospective observational study was designed to evaluate the impact of 
      recurrence on overall survival (OS) among patients with HCC following initial 
      curative-intent resection or ablation. We used the Surveillance, Epidemiology, 
      and End Results cancer registry linked with Medicare claims (January 1, 
      2010-December 31, 2019). Eligible patients (≥66 years) diagnosed with HCC 
      (2010-2017) had liver resection or ablation within 180 days of diagnosis. 
      Patients were stratified by recurrence status using diagnosis- and 
      treatment-based definitions of recurrence. Early or late recurrence was defined 
      as within 1 year or after 1 year, respectively. Adjusted OS analyses used 
      multivariable Cox regression models. RESULTS: A total of 1,146 patients were 
      included. During a median overall follow-up of 35.2 months, 736 (64%) patients 
      had a recurrence, of whom 380 (52%) had early recurrence (within 1 year). In the 
      adjusted analysis, patients with recurrence had a 2.24-fold higher risk of death 
      (95% confidence interval 1.85, 2.71; P < 0.001). Patients with early recurrence 
      had a 1.39-fold higher risk of death (95% confidence interval 1.14, 1.68; P < 
      0.001) than those with late recurrence. CONCLUSIONS: Recurrence and the timing of 
      recurrence are significant predictors of increased mortality risk for patients 
      with HCC following initial curative-intent resection or ablation, highlighting 
      the need for effective adjuvant therapies that may delay or avoid recurrences.

TI  - Anlotinib Combined With Toripalimab as First-Line Therapy for Unresectable 
      Hepatocellular Carcinoma: A Prospective, Multicenter, Phase II Study.
PG  - e1239-e1247
LID - 10.1093/oncolo/oyad169 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: For patients with unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), the 
      first-line therapeutic options are still relatively limited, and treatment 
      outcomes remain poor. We aimed to assess the efficacy and safety of anlotinib 
      combined with toripalimab as first-line therapy for unresectable HCC. METHODS: In 
      this single-arm, multicenter, phase II study (ALTER-H-003), patients with 
      advanced HCC without previous systemic anticancer therapy were recruited. 
      Eligible patients were given anlotinib (12 mg on days 1-14) combined with 
      toripalimab (240 mg on day 1) in a 3-week cycle. The primary endpoint was the 
      objective response rate (ORR) by immune-related Response Evaluation Criteria in 
      Solid Tumours (irRECIST)/RECIST v1.1 and modified RECIST (mRECIST). Secondary 
      endpoints included disease control rate (DCR), duration of response (DoR), 
      progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), and safety. RESULTS: 
      Between January 2020 and Jul 2021, 31 eligible patients were treated and included 
      in the full analysis set. At data cutoff (January 10, 2023), the ORR was 29.0% 
      (95% CI: 12.1%-46.0%) by irRECIST/RECIST v1.1, and 32.3% (95% CI: 14.8%-49.7%) by 
      mRECIST criteria, respectively. Confirmed DCR and median DoR by irRECIST/RECIST 
      v1.1 and mRECIST criteria were 77.4 % (95% CI: 61.8%-93.0%) and not reached 
      (range: 3.0-22.5+ months), respectively. Median PFS was 11.0 months (95% CI: 
      3.4-18.5 months) and median OS was 18.2 months (95% CI: 15.8-20.5 months). Of the 
      31 patients assessed for adverse events (AEs), the most common grade ≥ 3 
      treatment-related AEs were hand-foot syndrome (9.7%, 3/31), hypertension (9.7%, 
      3/31), arthralgia (9.7%, 3/31), abnormal liver function (6.5%, 2/31), and 
      decreased neutrophil counts (6.5%, 2/31). CONCLUSIONS: Anlotinib combined with 
      toripalimab showed promising efficacy and manageable safety in Chinese patients 
      with unresectable HCC in the first-line setting. This combination therapy may 
      offer a potential new therapeutic approach for patients with unresectable HCC.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study was aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of 
      transarterial chemoembolization combined with tyrosine kinase inhibitors and 
      camrelizumab in the treatment of unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma and to 
      explore a new therapeutic strategy for the treatment of advanced HCC. PATIENTS 
      AND METHODS: A total of 87 patients aged 18-75 years with at least one measurable 
      lesion per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (version 1.1) were 
      included in the study. TACE was administered as needed, and camrelizumab and TKI 
      medication were initiated within two weeks and one week after TACE, respectively. 
      The primary endpoints were progression-free survival and objective response rate. 
      RESULTS: The 87 patients in this trial were last evaluated on September 28, 2022, 
      and 35.8% were still receiving treatment at the data cutoff. A total of 34 
      patients (39.1%) died, and the median OS was not reached. The median PFS was 10.5 
      months (95% CI: 7.8-13.1). The ORR rate was 71.3% (62/87), and the DCR rate was 
      89.7% (78/87) per mRECIST. According to RECIST version 1.1, the ORR rate was 
      35.6% (31/87), and the DCR rate was 87.4% (76/87). Ten patients (11.5%) 
      successfully underwent conversion therapy and all achieved R0 resection. Two 
      patients achieved a complete pathological response, four achieved a major 
      pathological response, and four had a partial response. All treatment-related 
      adverse events were tolerated. No serious adverse events were observed, and no 
      treatment-related deaths occurred. CONCLUSIONS: TACE combined with TKI and 
      camrelizumab was safe and effective in treating advanced HCC. Triple therapy may 
      benefit patients with large tumor burden and portal vein cancer thrombus and is 
      expected to provide a new treatment strategy for advanced HCC. CLINICAL TRIAL

TI  - Efficacy and safety of atezolizumab/bevacizumab in patients with HCC after prior 
      systemic therapy: A global, observational study.
LID - 10.1097/HC9.0000000000000302 [doi]
LID - e0302
AB  - BACKGROUND: Since the introduction of the combination treatment of 
      anti-programmed death-ligand 1 antibody atezolizumab and anti-VEGF antibody 
      bevacizumab (AB), median overall survival in HCC has drastically improved. 
      However, evidence on the efficacy and safety of the novel treatment standard in 
      patients with prior exposure to systemic treatment is scarce. The aim of this 
      global, multicenter, observational study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety 
      of AB in patients after previous systemic therapy. METHODS: We screened our 
      global, multicenter, prospectively maintained registry database for patients who 
      received any systemic therapy before AB. The primary end point was overall 
      survival; secondary end points were time-to-progression, progression-free 
      survival, objective response rate, and safety (rate and severity of adverse 
      events). RESULTS: Among 493 patients who received AB for unresectable HCC, 61 
      patients received prior systemic therapy and were included in this analysis. The 
      median age of the study population was 66 years, with 91.8% males. Predominant 
      risk factors for HCC were viral hepatitis (59%) and alcohol (23%). Overall 
      survival for AB was 16.2 (95% CI, 14.5-17.9) months, time-to-progression and 
      progression-free survival were 4.1 (95% CI, 1.5-6.6) and 3.1 (95% CI, 1.1-5.1) 
      months, respectively. The objective response rate was 38.2% (7.3% with complete 
      and 30.9% with partial response). Overall survival was not influenced by 
      treatment line (2nd vs. >2nd) or previous systemic treatment modality (tyrosine 
      kinase inhibitors vs. immune checkpoint inhibitors). Treatment-related adverse 
      events of all grades according to Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events 
      were documented in 42.6% of patients, with only 13.1% of grade ≥3, including one 
      death. CONCLUSION: In this observational study, AB emerges as a safe and 
      efficacious treatment option in patients with HCC previously treated with other 
      systemic therapy.

TI  - Bortezomib in previously treated phosphatase and tension homology-deficient 
      patients with advanced intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma: An open-label, 
      prospective and single-centre phase II trial.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC) is characterized by a dismal 
      prognosis with limited therapeutic alternatives. To explore phosphatase and 
      tension homolog (PTEN) as a biomarker for proteasome inhibition in ICC, we 
      conducted a phase II trial to assess the second-line efficacy of bortezomib in 
      PTEN-deficient advanced ICC patients. METHODS: A total of 130 patients with 
      advanced ICC in our centre were screened by PTEN immunohistochemical staining 
      between 1 July 2017, and 31 December 2021, and 16 patients were ultimately 
      enrolled and treated with single-agent bortezomib 1.3 mg/m(2) on days 1, 4, 8 and 
      11 of a 21-day cycle. The primary endpoint was the objective response rate (ORR) 
      according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors v1.1. RESULTS: The 
      median follow-up was 6.55 months (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.7-19.9 months). 
      Among the 16 enrolled patients, the ORR was 18.75% (3/16) and the disease control 
      rate was 43.75% (7/16). The median progress-free survival was 2.95 months (95% 
      CI: 2.1-5.1 months) and the median overall survival (mOS) was 7.2 months (95% CI: 
      0.7-21.6 months) in the intent-to-treat-patients. Treatment-related adverse 
      events of any grade were reported in 16 patients, with thrombopenia being the 
      most common toxicity. Patients with PTEN staining scores of 0 were more likely to 
      benefit from bortezomib than those with staining scores > 0. CONCLUSIONS: 
      Bortezomib yielded an encouraging objective response and a favourable OS as a 
      second-line agent in PTEN-deficient ICC patients. Our findings suggest bortezomib 
      as a promising therapeutic option for patients with PTEN-deficient ICC. 
      HIGHLIGHTS: There is a limited strategy for the second-line option of 
      intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC). This investigator-initiated phase 2 study 
      evaluated bortezomib in ICC patients with phosphatase and tension homology 
      deficiency. The overall response rate was 18.75% and the overall survival was 7.2 
      months in the intent-to-treat cohort. These results justify further developing 
      bortezomib in ICC patients with PTEN deficiency.

TI  - The association between alcohol consumption and the risk of hepatocellular 
      carcinoma according to glycemic status in Korea: A nationwide population-based 
      study.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Alcohol and diabetes are known risk factors for hepatocellular 
      carcinoma (HCC); however, it is unclear whether the association between alcohol 
      consumption and HCC risk differs by fasting serum glucose level and diabetes. We 
      investigated the dose-response relationship between alcohol consumption and the 
      risk of HCC according to glycemic status. METHODS AND FINDINGS: This 
      population-based observational cohort study included patients who underwent 
      general health checkups in 2009 using the Korean National Health Insurance 
      Service Database. The primary outcome was HCC incidence, and Cox proportional 
      hazard regression analysis was performed to estimate the relationship between 
      alcohol consumption and HCC risk according to glycemic status. A total of 34,321 
      patients newly diagnosed with HCC were observed in the median follow-up period of 
      8.3 years. In the multivariable model, we adjusted for age, sex, smoking, regular 
      exercise, income, hypertension, dyslipidemia, and body mass index. 
      Mild-to-moderate alcohol consumption increased the risk of HCC in all glycemic 
      statuses (normoglycemia: hazard ratio [HR], 1.06; 95% confidence interval [CI], 
      1.02 to 1.10; prediabetes: HR, 1.19; 95% CI, 1.14 to 1.24; and diabetes: HR, 
      2.02; 95% CI, 1.93 to 2.11) compared to normoglycemic nondrinking. Heavy alcohol 
      consumption also increased the risk of HCC in all glycemic statuses 
      (normoglycemia: HR, 1.39; 95% CI, 1.32 to 1.46; prediabetes: HR, 1.67; 95% CI, 
      1.58 to 1.77; and diabetes: HR, 3.29; 95% CI, 3.11 to 3.49) compared to 
      normoglycemic nondrinking. Since alcohol consumption information in this study 
      was based on a self-administered questionnaire, there may be a possibility of 
      underestimation. Although we excluded patients with a history of viral hepatitis 
      using diagnosis codes, we could not obtain information on hepatitis B or 
      hepatitis C serum markers. CONCLUSIONS: Both mild-to-moderate and heavy alcohol 
      consumption was associated with an increased risk of HCC in all glycemic 
      statuses. The increased risk of HCC according to alcohol consumption was the 
      highest in the diabetes group, suggesting that more intensive alcohol abstinence 
      is required for patients with diabetes.

AB  - STUDY OBJECTIVE: To determine if single-injection bilateral posterior quadratus 
      lumborum block (QLB) with ropivacaine would improve postoperative analgesia in 
      the first 24 h after laparoscopic hepatectomy, compared with 0.9% saline. DESIGN: 
      Prospective, double blinded, randomized controlled trial. SETTING: A single 
      tertiary care center from November 2021 and January 2023. PATIENTS: A total of 94 
      patients scheduled to undergo laparoscopic hepatectomy due to hepatocellular 
      carcinoma. INTERVENTIONS: Ninety-four patients were randomized into a QLB group 
      (receiving 20 mL of 0.375% ropivacaine on each side, 150 mg in total) or a 
      control group (receiving 20 mL of 0.9% saline on each side). MEASUREMENTS: The 
      primary outcome was the cumulative opioid consumption during the initial 24-h 
      post-surgery. Secondary outcomes included pain scores and intraoperative and 
      recovery parameters. MAIN RESULTS: The mean cumulative opioid consumption during 
      the initial 24-h post-surgery was 30.8 ± 22.4 mg in the QLB group (n = 46) and 
      34.0 ± 19.4 mg in the control group (n = 46, mean differences: -3.3 mg, 95% 
      confidence interval, -11.9 to 5.4, p = 0.457). The mean resting pain score at 1 h 
      post-surgery was significantly lower in the QLB group than in the control group 
      (5 [4-6.25] vs. 7 [4.75-8], p = 0.035). No significant intergroup differences 
      were observed in the resting or coughing pain scores at other time points or in 
      other secondary outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: Preoperative bilateral posterior QLB did 
      not reduce cumulative opioid consumption during the first 24 h after laparoscopic 
      hepatectomy.

TI  - Impact of telephone follow-up on hepatocellular carcinoma patients receiving oral 
      chemotherapy from an ambulatory-care setting.
PG  - 1378-1384

AB  - INTRODUCTION: In recent years, most molecular target drugs have been administered 
      orally, as prescribed at ambulatory services in hospitals and at patients' homes. 
      Telephone follow-up is increasingly being used in clinical practice for patients 
      needing additional support post-discharge and for the prevention of hospital 
      readmissions. The purpose of this study was to clarify the clinical benefits of 
      telephone follow-up while administering oral anticancer drugs. METHODS: This was 
      a single-center, observational, retrospective study. We evaluated hepatocellular 
      carcinoma patients who received sorafenib or lenvatinib between March 2010 and 
      February 2018. The primary endpoint was the incidence of adverse events. RESULTS: 
      From the total of 130 patients, 83 patients received telephone follow-up and 47 
      did not. The incidence of hand-foot skin reactions significantly reduced in 
      patients with telephone follow-up (odds ratio (OR) 3.69, 95% confidence interval 
      (CI) 1.16-11.8, p = 0.020). The median durations (ranges) of adherence to oral 
      chemotherapy were 259 days (15-1730) for the telephone follow-up group and 121 
      days (14-1105) for the no-telephone follow-up group (p < 0.001). Moreover, the 
      disease control rate was significantly higher in the telephone follow-up group 
      (OR 2.52, 95% CI 1.15-5.53, p = 0.020). CONCLUSIONS: Remote interventions, such 
      as telephone follow-up, are useful means of managing adverse events in patients 
      receiving oral anticancer drugs and can lead to improved treatment results.

TI  - Voxel-based dosimetry predicting treatment response and related toxicity in HCC 
      patients treated with resin-based Y90 radioembolization: a prospective, 
      single-arm study.
PG  - 1743-1752
LID - 10.1007/s00259-023-06111-9 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: There is an increasing body of evidence indicating Y90 dose 
      thresholds for tumor response and treatment-related toxicity. These thresholds 
      are poorly studied in resin Y90, particularly in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). 
      PURPOSE: To evaluate the efficacy of prospective voxel-based dosimetry for 
      predicting treatment response and adverse events (AEs) in patients with HCC 
      undergoing resin-based Y90 radioembolization. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This 
      correlative study was based on a prospective single-arm clinical trial 
      (NCT04172714), which evaluated the efficacy of low/scout (555 MBq) activity of 
      resin-based Y90 for treatment planning. Partition model was used with goal of 
      tumor dose (TD) > 200 Gy and non-tumoral liver dose (NTLD) < 70 Gy for 
      non-segmental therapies. Single compartment dose of 200 Gy was used for 
      segmentectomies. Prescribed Y90 activity minus scout activity was administered 
      for therapeutic Y90 followed by Y90-PET/CT. Sureplan® (MIM Software, Cleveland, 
      OH) was used for dosimetry analysis. Treatment response was evaluated at 3 and 
      6 months. Receiver operating characteristic curve determined TD response 
      threshold for objective response (OR) and complete response (CR) as well as 
      non-tumor liver dose (NTLD) threshold that predicted AEs. RESULTS: N = 30 
      patients were treated with 33 tumors (19 segmental and 14 non-segmental). One 
      patient died before the first imaging, and clinical follow-up was excluded from 
      this analysis. Overall, 26 (81%) of the tumors had an OR and 23 (72%) had a CR. A 
      mean TD of 253 Gy predicted an OR with 92% sensitivity and 83% specificity (area 
      under the curve (AUC = 0.929, p < 0.001). A mean TD of 337 Gy predicted a CR with 
      83% sensitivity and 89% specificity (AUC = 0.845, p < 0.001). A mean NTLD of 81 
      and 87 Gy predicted grade 3 AEs with 100% sensitivity and 100% specificity in the 
      non-segmental cohort at 3- and 6-month post Y90, respectively. CONCLUSION: In 
      patients with HCC undergoing resin-based Y90, there are dose response and dose 
      toxicity thresholds directly affecting outcomes. CLINICAL TRIAL NUMBER: 
      NCT04172714.

TI  - Real-World, Observational, Retrospective Study to Evaluate the Effectiveness and 
      Safety of Treatment with Sorafenib in Patients with Advanced Hepatocellular 
      Carcinoma.
PG  - 6778-6790
LID - 10.3390/curroncol31110500 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) accounts for approximately 90% of 
      liver cancer cases. Sorafenib, the first drug to demonstrate survival benefits 
      for advanced HCC, was validated through the SHARP randomized clinical trial 
      (RCT). While RCTs are essential for assessing new therapies, real-world studies 
      provide additional insights into their effectiveness in routine clinical 
      practice. This study aimed to evaluate sorafenib's real-world effectiveness by 
      analyzing overall survival (OS) and the time to radiological and symptomatic 
      progression. METHODS: Data from 368 patients treated with sorafenib at a 
      Brazilian Cancer Center between 2009 and 2020 were retrospectively reviewed. 
      RESULTS: The median OS was 9.6 months, and the time to radiological progression 
      was 5.3 months, similar to the SHARP trial. However, the time to symptomatic 
      progression was shorter (2.3 months) than the SHARP study (4.1 months). In terms 
      of safety, 27.4% of patients presented clinically relevant toxicities, and 24.5% 
      needed to discontinue treatment due to toxicity. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, sorafenib 
      demonstrated effectiveness in the studied population, with OS and radiological 
      progression times comparable to SHARP study results. The difference in 
      symptomatic progression may be due to the study's retrospective nature and 
      limitations.

TI  - Bicarbonate ringer's solution could improve the intraoperative acid-base 
      equilibrium and reduce hepatocellular enzyme levels after deceased donor liver 
      transplantation: a randomized controlled study.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Bicarbonate Ringer's (BR) solution is a direct liver and kidney 
      metabolism-independent HCO(3)(-) buffering system. We hypothesized that BR 
      solution would be more effective in improving acid-base equilibrium and more 
      conducive to better liver function than Acetate Ringer's (AR) solution in 
      conventional orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT) patients. METHODS: Sixty-nine 
      adult patients underwent OLT. Patients in the bicarbonate and acetate groups 
      received BR solution or AR solution as infused crystalloids and graft washing 
      solution, respectively. The primary outcome was the effect on pH and base excess 
      (BE) levels. The secondary outcome measures were the incidence and volume of 
      intraoperative 5% sodium bicarbonate infusion and laboratory indicates of liver 
      and kidney function. RESULTS: The pH and absolute BE values changed significantly 
      during the anhepatic phase and immediately after transplanted liver reperfusion 
      in the bicarbonate group compared with the acetate group (all P < 0.05). The 
      incidence and volume of 5% sodium bicarbonate infusion were lower in the 
      bicarbonate group than in the acetate group (all P < 0.05). The aspartate 
      transaminase (AST) level at 7 postoperative days and the creatine level at 30 
      postoperative days were significantly higher in the acetate group than in the 
      bicarbonate group (all P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: Compared with AR solution, BR 
      solution was associated with improved intraoperative acid-base balance and 
      potentially protected early postoperative liver graft function and reduced 
      late-postoperative renal injury.

TI  - Do low skeletal muscle bulk and disturbed body fat mass impact tumor recurrence 
      in stage I/II hepatocellular carcinoma undergoing surgery? An observational 
      cohort study.
PG  - 7067-7079

AB  - INTRODUCTION: The influence of deranged body composition on stage I/II 
      hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) after surgery remains undetermined. The current 
      study aimed to investigate the impact of low skeletal muscle bulk and disturbed 
      body fat mass on the recurrence outcome of stage I/II HCC patients undergoing 
      liver resection. The associated metabolomic alterations were also assessed. 
      METHODS: From 2012 to 2021, stage I and II HCC patients who underwent liver 
      resection at our institute were retrospectively reviewed. Their preoperative body 
      composition including skeletal muscle mass and body fat volume was measured by 
      computed tomography (CT). The recurrence outcome was recorded and analyzed. The 
      preoperative serum was collected and subjected to metabolomic analysis. RESULTS: 
      A total of 450 stage I and II HCC patients were included in the current study. 
      Among them, 76% were male and around 60% had HBV infection. After stratified by 
      normal cut-off values obtained from a healthy cohort, 6.4% of stage I/II HCC 
      patients were found to have a low psoas muscle index (PMI), 17.8% a high 
      subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT) index, and 27.8% a high visceral adipose tissue 
      (VAT) index. Cox regression multivariate analysis further demonstrated that low 
      PMI and high SAT index were independent prognostic factors for time-to-recurrence 
      (TTR) after surgery. Metabolomic analysis discovered that free fatty acid 
      β-oxidation was enhanced in patients with low PMI or high SAT index. CONCLUSION: 
      The current study demonstrated that reduced psoas muscle mass may impair while 
      elevated SAT may prolong the TTR of stage I/II HCC patients undergoing liver 
      resections. VAT, on the other hand, was not associated with recurrence outcomes 
      after surgery. Further studies are warranted to validate our findings.

TI  - Effectiveness of mailed outreach and patient navigation to promote HCC screening 
      process completion: a multicentre pragmatic randomised clinical trial.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is plagued by failures across the 
      cancer care continuum, leading to frequent late-stage diagnoses and high 
      mortality. We evaluated the effectiveness of mailed outreach invitations plus 
      patient navigation to promote HCC screening process completion in patients with 
      cirrhosis. METHODS: Between April 2018 and September 2021, we conducted a 
      multicentre pragmatic randomised clinical trial comparing mailed outreach plus 
      patient navigation for HCC screening (n=1436) versus usual care with visit-based 
      screening (n=1436) among patients with cirrhosis at three US health systems. Our 
      primary outcome was screening process completion over a 36-month period, and our 
      secondary outcome was the proportion of time covered (PTC) by screening. All 
      patients were included in intention-to-screen analyses. RESULTS: All 2872 
      participants (median age 61.3 years; 32.3% women) were included in 
      intention-to-screen analyses. Screening process completion was observed in 6.6% 
      (95% CI: 5.3% to 7.9%) of patients randomised to outreach and 3.3% (95% CI: 2.4% 
      to 4.3%) of those randomised to usual care (OR 2.05, 95% CI: 1.44 to 2.92). The 
      intervention increased HCC screening process completion across most subgroups 
      including age, sex, race and ethnicity, Child-Turcotte-Pugh class and health 
      system. PTC was also significantly higher in the outreach arm than usual care 
      (mean 37.5% vs 28.2%; RR 1.33, 95% CI: 1.31 to 1.35). Despite screening underuse, 
      most HCC in both arms were detected at an early stage. CONCLUSION: Mailed 
      outreach plus navigation significantly increased HCC screening process completion 
      versus usual care in patients with cirrhosis, with a consistent effect across 
      most examined subgroups. However, screening completion remained suboptimal in 
      both arms, underscoring a need for more intensive interventions. TRIAL

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the frequency of different types of cancer in patients 
      diagnosed with hypothyroidism using big data methodology on the Savana Manager 
      platform. METHODS: An observational, retrospective study was carried out using 
      electronic medical record (EMR) data from the Hospital Universitario Puerta de 
      Hierro Majadahonda (Madrid). Information from the EMRs was extracted using 
      artificial intelligence techniques and analysed using the Savana Manager v3.0 
      software. Searches were performed using the term "hypothyroidism" and the terms 
      corresponding to the tumours analysed. RESULTS: Of a total population of 506,749 
      patients, 23,570 (4.7%) were diagnosed with hypothyroidism. Patients with this 
      diagnosis had a significantly higher frequency of cancer than that found in 
      non-hypothyroid subjects (OR 2.09, 95% confidence interval [CI] 2.01-2.17). This 
      higher frequency was found both in women (OR 1.99, 95% CI 1.90-2.08) and in men 
      (OR 2.83, 95% CI 2.63-3.05). However, this higher frequency of cancer was not 
      observed in hypothyroid patients older than 60 years (OR 0.97, 95% CI 0.92-1.02). 
      Although the frequency of most of the neoplasms studied individually was higher 
      in the population with hypothyroidism, we observed that hypothyroid patients over 
      60 years of age had a significant decrease in the frequency of prostate, lung, 
      colorectal, and liver cancer. CONCLUSION: Data from this hospital cohort suggest 
      that there is a significant association between the diagnosis of hypothyroidism 
      and cancer. However, this association is less evident in hypothyroid patients 
      older than 60 years.

TI  - Association of adverse events and quality of life in patients with unresectable 
      hepatocellular carcinoma.
PG  - 3377-3386

AB  - PURPOSE: Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the third-leading cause of 
      cancer-related deaths globally. Patients are often diagnosed with advanced 
      disease, in which systemic and locoregional therapies are commonly used as 
      first-line treatment. Such treatments can cause adverse events (AEs) that 
      negatively affect quality of life (QoL), which is particularly undesirable where 
      prognosis is poor. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the impact of 
      common AEs on QoL in patients with HCC. METHODS: Data from the SARAH randomized 
      controlled trial (RCT) were analyzed. Given the large number of distinct AEs that 
      occurred in the trial, AEs were grouped as in the SARAH trial and prioritized 
      using principal component analysis (PCA). Linear mixed-effects models were then 
      applied with age, ECOG status, and AEs as predictors of the QoL change as 
      measured with the EORTC Core Quality of Life Questionnaire (QLQ-C30). RESULTS: 
      The PCA resulted in the selection of 28 AEs for inclusion in the linear 
      mixed-effects models. Of the 28 AEs, diarrhea, decreased appetite, abdominal 
      pain, and palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia syndrome (hand-foot syndrome) were 
      significant drivers of reductions in QoL as measured using the QLQ-C30 global 
      health status scale. Diarrhea, abdominal pain, and hand-foot syndrome were also 
      significant drivers of reduced QoL outcomes. CONCLUSION: The present analysis 
      showed that diarrhea, decreased appetite, abdominal pain, and palmar-plantar 
      erythrodysesthesia were significantly associated with reduced QoL in patients 
      with unresectable HCC. Reducing the incidence and/or severity of these AEs should 
      therefore be a key focus when selecting the optimal treatments for these 
      patients.

      carcinoma: A prospective controlled trial.
PG  - 20311-20320
LID - 10.1002/cam4.6602 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The effectiveness and security of radiofrequency ablation (RFA) in 
      combination with toripalimab (anti-PD-1) for the treatment of recurrent 
      hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) was studied in this article. METHODS: Total of 40 
      patients were enrolled in the study between September 2019 and November 2021. 
      Data follow-up ends in April 2022. The study's main focus is on recurrence free 
      survival (RFS), while the secondary objectives was safety. Chi-square tests, 
      Kaplan-Meier, and Cox proportional hazards models were utilized to analyze the 
      data. RESULTS: The median follow-up period was 21.40 months, and the median RFS 
      was 15.40 months in the group that received combination therapy, which was 
      statistically significantly different (HR: 0.44, p = 0.04) compared with the RFA 
      group (8.2 months). RFS rates (RFSr) at 6, 12 and 18 months in the combination 
      therapy groups and RFA groups were 80% vs 65%, 62.7% vs 35% and 48.7% vs 18.8%, 
      respectively. Between the two groups, significant difference of RFSr was found at 
      18 months (p = 0.04). No statistical differences were observed between the two 
      groups in terms of safeness (p > 0.05). The subgroup analysis indicated that the 
      combination of RFA and anti-PD-1 led to better RFS than RFA alone. Moreover, 
      patients benefited more from combination therapy in the groups younger than 60 
      years (HR: 0.26, p = 0.018), male (HR: 0.32, p = 0.028) and Child-Pugh grade A 
      (HR: 0.38, p = 0.032). CONCLUSIONS: Combining RFA with anti-PD-1 showed improved 
      RFS and was deemed safe for patients with recurrent HCC who had previously 
      undergone RFA treatment alone.

LID - e40421
AB  - This study aimed to examine serum pentraxin 3 levels in patients with primary 
      liver cancer and to assess its potential as a diagnostic and prognostic 
      biomarker. Serum samples were obtained from 180 patients with primary liver 
      cancer and 180 healthy control subjects. The concentration of PTX3 in these 
      samples was measured using an ELISA kit. The study also investigated the 
      correlation between PTX3 levels and the clinicopathological characteristics of 
      patients with primary liver cancer. The effectiveness of serum PTX3 in diagnosing 
      primary liver cancer was evaluated using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) 
      curves and their corresponding areas under the curve (AUC). The prognostic 
      significance of serum PTX3 in patients with primary liver cancer was assessed 
      using Kaplan-Meier survival curves. Serum PTX3 levels were elevated in patients 
      with primary liver cancer compared to those in healthy control subjects. These 
      levels were significantly correlated with drinking history, TNM stage, BCLC 
      stage, tumor size, tumor number, and vascular invasion. However, no significant 
      correlations were observed between PTX3 levels and other factors, such as age, 
      sex, BMI, liver cirrhosis, histological grade, and histological type. With a 
      cut-off value of 5.1 ng/mL, PTX3 effectively differentiated patients with primary 
      liver cancer from healthy control subjects, achieving an AUC of 0.734, a 
      sensitivity of 73.24%, and a specificity of 84.78%. Patients with higher serum 
      PTX3 levels had lower overall survival rates and recurrence-free survival rates 
      than those with lower PTX3 levels. Serum PTX3 levels are elevated in patients 
      with primary liver cancer and high serum PTX3 levels are associated with poor 
      prognosis. This suggests that serum PTX3 has the potential to be a novel 
      biomarker for both the diagnosis and prognosis of primary liver cancer. These 
      findings may improve patient outcomes by enabling early detection and continuous 
      monitoring.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Current clinical guidelines recommend systematic antitumour therapy 
      as the primary treatment option for patients with stage IIIb hepatocellular 
      carcinoma (HCC) based on the China liver cancer (CNLC) staging criteria. Several 
      different targeted therapeutics have been applied in combination with 
      immunotherapeutic regimens to date in patients with advanced HCC. The present 
      study was developed to evaluate the relative safety and efficacy of hepatectomy 
      of HCC in combination with targeted apatinib treatment and immunotherapeutic 
      camrelizumab treatment CNLC-IIIb stage HCC patients with the goal of providing 
      evidence regarding the potential value of this therapeutic regimen in individuals 
      diagnosed with advanced HCC. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: This is a multicentre phase II 
      trial with single-arm in which patients undergo hepatectomy in combination with 
      targeted treatment (apatinib) and immunotherapy (camrelizumab). Patients will 
      undergo follow-up every 2-3 months following treatment initiation to record any 
      evidence of disease progression and adverse event incidence for a minimum of 24 
      months following the discontinuation of treatment until reaching study endpoint 
      events or trial termination. The primary endpoint for this study is patient 
      mortality. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: This study protocol was approved by the 
      Ethics Committee of the Guangxi Medical University Cancer Hospital (KS2022[124]). 
      The results of this study will be submitted for publication in a peer-reviewed 
      journal. TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: NCT05062837.

TI  - Prediction of Liver-Related Events With a Combination of Liver Stiffness 
      Measurements and Controlled Attenuation Parameters in Japanese Patients With 
      Biopsy-Proven Non-alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease.
PG  - 1658-1664

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Liver stiffness measurements (LSMs) and controlled attenuation 
      parameters (CAPs) obtained using vibration-controlled transient elastography 
      (VCTE) are recognized non-invasive methods of assessing liver histology. The 
      usefulness of CAP for predicting liver-related events (LREs: hepatocellular 
      carcinoma, decompensation, bleeding varices) is not well understood worldwide. 
      Our aim was to re-evaluate the cutoff values of LSM/CAP in Japan and to examine 
      whether LSM/CAP can predict LRE. METHODS: Japanese NAFLD patients (n = 403) who 
      underwent both liver biopsy and VCTE were enrolled. We determined optimal cutoff 
      values of LSM/CAP diagnoses for fibrosis stage and steatosis grade and 
      investigated their clinical outcome based on LSM/CAP values. RESULTS: The LSM 
      cutoff values for F1 to F4 are 7.1, 7.9, 10.0 and 20.2 kPa, and the CAP cutoff 
      values for S1 to S3 are 230, 282 and 320 dB/m. During a median follow-up of 2.7 y 
      (range: 0.0-12.5 y), 11 patients developed LREs. The incidence of LREs in the LSM 
      Hi (≥8.7) group was significantly higher than that in the LSM Lo (<8.7) group 
      (p = 0.003), and the incidence in the CAP Lo (<295) group was higher than that in 
      CAP Hi (≥295) group (p = 0.018). Considering LSM and CAP together, the risk of 
      LRE was higher in the LSM Hi CAP Lo group than in the LSM Hi CAP Hi group 
      (p = 0.03). CONCLUSION: We set LSM/CAP cutoff values to diagnose liver fibrosis 
      and steatosis in Japan. Our study determined that NAFLD patients with high LSM 
      and low CAP values are at high risk for LREs.

AB  - This study aims to develop and validate a predictive nomogram for severe 
      postoperative pleural effusion (SPOPE) in patients undergoing hepatectomy for 
      liver cancer. A total of 536 liver cancer patients who underwent hepatectomy at 
      the Department of Hepatobiliary Surgery I of the Affiliated Hospital of North 
      Sichuan Medical College from January 1, 2018, to December 31, 2022, were enrolled 
      in a retrospective observational study and comprised the training dataset. Lasso 
      regression and logistic regression analyses were employed to construct a 
      predictive nomogram. The nomogram was internally validated using Bootstrapping 
      and externally validated with a dataset of 203 patients who underwent liver 
      cancer resection at the Department of General Surgery III of the same hospital 
      from January 1, 2020, to December 31, 2022. We evaluated the nomogram using the 
      receiver operating characteristic curve, calibration curve, and decision curve 
      analysis. Variables such as drinking history, postoperative serum albumin, 
      postoperative total bilirubin, right hepatectomy, diaphragm incision, and 
      intraoperative blood loss were observed to be associated with SPOPE. These 
      factors were integrated into our nomogram. The C-index of the nomogram was 0.736 
      (95% CI: 0.692-0.781) in the training set and 0.916 (95% CI: 0.872-0.961) in the 
      validation set. The nomogram was then evaluated using sensitivity, specificity, 
      positive predictive value, negative predictive value, calibration curve, and 
      decision curve analysis. The nomogram demonstrates good discriminative ability, 
      calibration, and clinical utility.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To assess the sensitivity and specificity of the 2019 EULAR/American 
      College of Rheumatology (ACR) classification criteria for systemic lupus 
      erythematosus (SLE) in outpatients at an academic tertiary care centre and to 
      compare them to the 1997 ACR and the 2012 Systemic Lupus International 
      Collaborating Clinics criteria. METHODS: Prospective and retrospective 
      observational cohort study. RESULTS: 3377 patients were included: 606 with SLE, 
      1015 with non-SLE autoimmune-mediated rheumatic diseases (ARD) and 1756 with 
      non-ARD diseases (hepatocellular carcinoma, primary biliary cirrhosis, autoimmune 
      hepatitis). The 2019 criteria were more sensitive than the 1997 criteria (87.0% 
      vs 81.8%), but less specific (98.1% vs 99.5% in the entire cohort and 96.5% vs 
      98.8% in patients with non-SLE ARD), resulting in Youden Indexes for patients 
      with SLE/non-SLE ARD of 0.835 and 0.806, respectively. The most sensitive items 
      were history of antinuclear antibody (ANA) positivity and detection of 
      anti-double-stranded deoxyribonucleic acid (dsDNA) antibodies. These were also 
      the least specific items. The most specific items were class III/IV lupus 
      nephritis and the combination of low C3 and low C4 complement levels, followed by 
      class II/V lupus nephritis, either low C3 or low C4 complement levels, delirium 
      and psychosis, when these were not attributable to non-SLE causes. CONCLUSIONS: 
      In this cohort from an independent academic medical centre, the sensitivity and 
      specificity of the 2019 lupus classification criteria were confirmed. Overall 
      agreement of the 1997 and the 2019 criteria was very good.

      non-inferiority, double-blind trial will enroll 128 treatment-naïve patients with 
      HCC (≤ 5 tumors, 1-5 cm in diameter) for conventional TACE. Participants will be 
      randomly assigned (1:1) to either IDA-TACE or DOX-TACE, with stratification by 
      Child-Pugh class. Superselective conventional TACE will be performed using 
      cone-beam CT and small-bore microcatheters. Patient evaluations, including 
      dynamic imaging and blood tests, will occur at 1, 3, and 6 months post-initial 
      treatment. The primary outcome measure is the objective response rate (ORR) 
      according to mRECIST at 6 months. Secondary outcomes include 3-month and 6-month 
      tumor responses, time-to-progression, the incidence of treatment-related serious 
      adverse events within 30 days, and the incidence and severity of any adverse 
      events. STATISTICS: Non-inferiority will be claimed if the upper limit of a 
      one-sided 97.5% confidence interval for the proportion difference (i.e., "6-month 
      ORR of DOX-TACE" - "6-month ORR of IDA-TACE") falls below 0.15 in both 
      intention-to-treat and per-protocol analyses. The proportion difference and its 
      confidence interval will be calculated by the Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel method to 
      obtain a weighted average of stratum-specific proportion differences. EXPECTED 
      GAIN OF KNOWLEDGE: If IDA-TACE demonstrates outcomes comparable to DOX-TACE, this 
      study could provide compelling evidence that various cytotoxic agents yield 
      similar contributions in TACE, considering the minor role of chemotherapeutic 
      agents in TACE. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov (

TI  - Serum Autotaxin Levels Predict Liver-Related Events in Patients With Primary 
      Biliary Cholangitis: A Long-Term Multicenter Observational Study.
PG  - e00779

AB  - INTRODUCTION: A straightforward, reliable, and noninvasive method for predicting 
      the development of liver-related events (LRE) in primary biliary cholangitis 
      (PBC) has not been attained thus far. This study investigated whether serum 
      autotaxin (ATX) could predict LRE in patients with PBC. METHODS: This 
      retrospective multicenter investigation included 190 biopsy-proven untreated 
      patients with PBC. All subjects were followed for at least 1 year, during which 
      time the prevalence of LRE, including newly developing hepatocellular carcinoma, 
      esophagogastric varices, ascites, and hepatic encephalopathy, was investigated in 
      relation with ATX levels at the time of liver biopsy. RESULTS: During the median 
      follow-up period of 9.7 years, LRE were observed in 22 patients (11.6%). The area 
      under the receiver operating characteristic curve and cutoff value of serum ATX 
      for predicting LRE were 0.80 and 1.086 mg/L, respectively. Patients with serum 
      ATX ≥1.086 had a significantly higher cumulative incidence of LRE compared with 
      patients with ATX < 1.086 (33.3% vs 3.6%, P < 0.00001). Notably, the predictive 
      capability of ATX for LRE in patients with PBC surpassed that of FIB-4, ALBI, 
      APRI, and Mac-2-binding protein glycan isomer. A multivariate Cox proportional 
      hazards model revealed ATX as an independent associated factor for LRE (hazard 
      ratio 6.24, 95% confidence interval 1.87-20.80, P = 0.003) along with Nakanuma 
      stage (hazard ratio 2.75, 95% confidence interval 1.52-4.99, P < 0.001). These 
      results were closely replicated in a serologically diagnosed PBC validation 
      cohort (n = 32). DISCUSSION: Serum ATX levels may serve as a predictive marker 
      for LRE in patients with PBC.

TI  - Dual CTLA-4 and PD-1 checkpoint blockade using CS1002 and CS1003 (nofazinlimab) 
      in patients with advanced solid tumors: A first-in-human, dose-escalation, and 
      dose-expansion study.
PG  - 1991-2002
LID - 10.1002/cncr.35226 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: This study investigated the safety and efficacy of an anti-CTLA-4 
      monoclonal antibody (CS1002) as monotherapy and in combination with an anti-PD-1 
      monoclonal antibody (CS1003) in patients with advanced/metastatic solid tumors. 
      METHODS: The phase 1 study involved phase 1a monotherapy dose-escalation (part 1) 
      and phase 1b combination therapy dose escalation (part 2) and expansion (part 3). 
      Various dosing schedules of CS1002 (0.3, 1, or 3 mg/kg every 3 weeks, or 3 mg/kg 
      every 9 weeks) were evaluated with 200 mg CS1003 every 3 weeks in part 3. 
      RESULTS: Parts 1, 2, and 3 included a total of 13, 18, and 61 patients, 
      respectively. No dose-limiting toxicities or maximum tolerated doses were 
      observed. Treatment-related adverse events (TRAEs) were reported in 30.8%, 83.3%, 
      and 75.0% of patients in parts 1, 2, and 3, respectively. Grade ≥3 TRAEs were 
      experienced by 15.4%, 50.0%, and 18.3% of patients in each part. Of 61 patients 
      evaluable for efficacy, 23 (37.7%) achieved objective responses in multiple tumor 
      types. Higher objective response rates were observed with conventional and 
      high-dose CS1002 regimens (1 mg/kg every 3 weeks or 3 mg/kg every 9 weeks) 
      compared to low-dose CS1002 (0.3 mg/kg every 3 weeks) in microsatellite 
      instability-high/mismatch repair-deficient tumors, melanoma, and hepatocellular 
      carcinoma (50.0% vs. 58.8%, 14.3% vs. 42.9%, and 0% vs. 16.7%). CONCLUSION: 
      CS1002, as monotherapy, and in combination with CS1003, had a manageable safety 
      profile across a broad dosing range. Promising antitumor activities were observed 
      in patients with immune oncology (IO)-naive and IO-refractory tumors across 
      CS1002 dose levels when combined with CS1003, supporting further evaluation of 
      this treatment combination for solid tumors. PLAIN LANGUAGE SUMMARY: CS1002 is a 
      human immunoglobulin (Ig) G1 monoclonal antibody that blocks the interaction of 
      CTLA-4 with its ligands and increases T-cell activation/proliferation. CS1003, 
      now named nofazinlimab, is a humanized, recombinant IgG4 monoclonal antibody that 
      blocks the interaction between human PD-1 and its ligands. In this original 
      article, we determined the safety profile of CS1002 as monotherapy and in 
      combination with CS1003. Furthermore, we explored the antitumor activity of the 
      combination in anti-programmed cell death protein (ligand)-1 (PD-[L]1)-naive 
      microsatellite instability-high/mismatch repair-deficient (MSI-H/dMMR) pan 
      tumors, and anti-PD-(L)1-refractory melanoma and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). 
      CS1002 in combination with CS1003 had manageable safety profile across a broad 
      dosing range and showed promising antitumor activities across CS1002 dose levels 
      when combined with CS1003. This supports further assessment of CS1002 in 
      combination with CS1003 for the treatment of solid tumors.

TI  - Correlation of pathological examination with indocyanine green (ICG) intensity 
      gradients: a prospective study in patients with liver tumor.
PG  - 3441-3447
LID - 10.1007/s00464-024-10840-9 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Intraoperative indocyanine green (ICG) fluorescence imaging has been 
      shown to be a new and innovative way to illustrate the optimal resection margin 
      in hepatectomy for hepatocellular carcinoma. This study investigated its accuracy 
      in resection margin determination by looking into the correlation of ICG 
      intensity gradients with pathological examination results of resected specimens. 
      METHODS: This was a prospective, single-center, non-randomized controlled study. 
      Patients who had liver tumors indicating liver resection were recruited. The 
      hypothesis was that the use of intraoperative near-infrared/ICG fluorescence 
      imaging would be a promising guiding tool for removing hepatocellular carcinoma 
      with a better resection margin. Patients were given ICG (0.25 mg/kg) 1 day before 
      operation. Resected specimens were inspected under a fluorescent imaging system. 
      Biopsies were taken from tumors and normal tissue. Color signals obtained from 
      ICG fluorescence imaging were compared with biopsies for analysis. RESULTS: 
      Twenty-two patients were recruited for study. The median size of their tumors was 
      2.25 cm. One patient had resection margin involvement. Under ICG fluorescence, 
      the tumors typically lighted up as yellow color, wrapped by a zone of green 
      color. Tumors of 17 patients (77.3%) displayed yellow color and were confirmed 
      malignancy, while tumors of 12 patients (54.5%) displayed green color and were 
      confirmed malignancy. Receiver operating characteristic curve was used to measure 
      the sensitivity and specificity of the green color to look for a clear resection 
      margin. The area under the curve was 85.3% (p = 0.019, 95% confidence interval 
      0.696-1.000), with a sensitivity of 0.706 and specificity of 1.000. CONCLUSION: 
      The use of ICG fluorescence can be helpful in determining resection margins. 
      Resection of tumor should include complete resection of the green zone shown in 
      the fluorescence image.

AB  - Overactivation of the JAK/STAT pathway is one of the drivers for the 
      pathophysiology of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). We propose a Phase Ib study to 
      evaluate the safety and efficacy of itacitinib, a selective JAK1 inhibitor, as a 
      second-line treatment for patients with advanced or metastatic HCC.Twenty-five 
      patients will receive 400 mg itacitinib orally daily, 28-day cycle. Safety will 
      be reviewed prior to each cycle. Tumor response assessed every 2 months until 
      disease progression, death or withdrawal. Tumor biopsies and blood samples will 
      be taken for presence of JAK1 mutations.Activation of JAK/STAT pathway drives HCC 
      development and is associated with immunotherapy resistance. Itacitinib is 
      hypothesized to be safe and effective in HCC patients that have progressed after 
      first-line therapies.Clinical Trial Registration: EudraCT: 2017-004437-81

TI  - A study on prevention of bleeding complications using lusutrombopag for safe RFA 
      in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma with low platelet counts: prospective 
      observational study.
PG  - 250

AB  - BACKGROUND: Platelet (PLT) transfusion was the most practical way to increase 
      patients' PLT counts before invasive hepatic procedures such as radiofrequency 
      ablation (RFA) for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). A novel drug that raises the 
      PLT count by acting on the thrombopoietin receptor has recently become available. 
      METHODS: Lusutrombopag 3 mg was administered daily for 7 days to patients who 
      underwent RFA for liver tumors with low PLT counts (< 50,000 PLT µL(- 1)). We 
      collected demographic data concerning the patients' liver function and PLT 
      counts. RESULTS: Lusutrombopag was administered to 91 patients, with a median age 
      of 71 years (range 51-86). Forty-two patients had hepatitis C, 12 had hepatitis 
      B, 21 had alcoholic liver disease, 11 had nonalcoholic steatohepatitis, and five 
      had other diseases. The median Child-Pugh score was 7 (range 5-11). Thirty-seven 
      patients had stage I tumors, 41 had Stage II, 12 had stage III, and one had stage 
      IV. PLT count was elevated from 4.4 × 10(4) ± 1.4 × 10(4) to 
      8.6 × 10(4) ± 2.5 × 10(4) PLT µL(- 1). Lusutrombopag administration prevented PLT 
      transfusions in 84/91 patients (92%). No patient had bleeding complications after 
      RFA. One had portal thrombosis after lusutrombopag administration. Patients who 
      achieved PLT counts of > 50,000 PLT µL(- 1) had higher PLT counts before 
      lusutrombopag administration. The degree of splenomegaly did not affect the rate 
      of PLT count elevation. There was no specific adverse effect by administrating 
      lusutrombopag for patients with PLT counts of around 50,000 µL(- 1) but > 50,000 
      µL(- 1). CONCLUSIONS: Lusutrombopag administration before RFA was effective and 
      seemed to be relatively safe for hepatocellular carcinoma patients with low PLT 
      counts. TRIAL REGISTRATION: This study was approved by Japanese Red Cross Medical 
      Center Institutional Reseach Comittie (#862, 07/03/2016), and was registered in a 
      publically accessible primary register (#UMIN000046629, registered date: 
      14/01/2022).

AB  - PURPOSE: Detection of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is crucial during 
      surveillance by ultrasound. We previously developed an artificial intelligence 
      (AI) system based on convolutional neural network for detection of focal liver 
      lesions (FLLs) in ultrasound. The primary aim of this study was to evaluate 
      whether the AI system can assist non-expert operators to detect FLLs in 
      real-time, during ultrasound examinations. METHOD: This single-center prospective 
      randomized controlled study evaluated the AI system in assisting non-expert and 
      expert operators. Patients with and without FLLs were enrolled and had ultrasound 
      performed twice, with and without AI assistance. McNemar's test was used to 
      compare paired FLL detection rates and false positives between groups with and 
      without AI assistance. RESULTS: 260 patients with 271 FLLs and 244 patients with 
      240 FLLs were enrolled into the groups of non-expert and expert operators, 
      respectively. In non-experts, FLL detection rate in the AI assistance group was 
      significantly higher than the no AI assistance group (36.9 % vs 21.4 %, 
      p < 0.001). In experts, FLL detection rates were not significantly different 
      between the groups with and without AI assistance (66.7 % vs 63.3 %, p = 0.32). 
      False positive detection rates in the groups with and without AI assistance were 
      not significantly different in both non-experts (14.2 % vs 9.2 %, p = 0.08) and 
      experts (8.6 % vs 9.0 %, p = 0.85). CONCLUSIONS: The AI system resulted in 
      significant increase in detection of FLLs during ultrasound examinations by 
      non-experts. Our findings may support future use of the AI system in 
      resource-limited settings where ultrasound examinations are performed by 
      non-experts. The study protocol was registered under the Thai Clinical Trial 
      Registry (TCTR20201230003), which is part of the WHO ICTRP Registry Network. The 
      registry can be accessed via the following URL:

TI  - Rotational ThromboElastometry-guided blood component administration versus 
      standard of care in patients with Cirrhosis and coagulopathy undergoing Invasive 
      ProcEdures (RECIPE): study protocol for a randomised controlled trial.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Patients with cirrhosis often undergo invasive procedures both for 
      management of complications of their advanced liver disease, including treatment 
      for hepatocellular carcinoma, as well as underlying comorbidities. Despite a 
      current understanding that most patients with cirrhosis are in a rebalanced 
      haemostatic state (despite abnormalities in conventional coagulation tests, 
      namely INR and platelet count), patients with cirrhosis are still often given 
      prophylactic blood components based on these conventional parameters, in an 
      effort to reduce procedure-related bleeding. Viscoelastic tests such as 
      Rotational Thromboelastometry (ROTEM) provide a global measurement of haemostasis 
      and have been shown to predict bleeding risk more accurately than conventional 
      coagulation tests, and better guide blood product transfusion in a number of 
      surgical and trauma-related settings. The aim of this study is to assess the 
      utility of a ROTEM-based algorithm to guide prophylactic blood component delivery 
      in patients with cirrhosis undergoing invasive procedures. We hypothesise that 
      ROTEM-based decision-making will lead to a reduction in pre-procedural blood 
      component usage, particularly fresh frozen plasma (FFP), compared with standard 
      of care, whilst maintaining optimal clinical outcomes. METHODS: This is a 
      multi-centre randomised controlled trial comparing ROTEM-guided prophylactic 
      blood component administration to standard of care in patients with cirrhosis and 
      coagulopathy undergoing invasive procedures. The primary efficacy outcome of the 
      trial is the proportion of procedures requiring prophylactic transfusion, with 
      the primary safety outcome being procedure-related bleeding complications. 
      Secondary outcomes include the amount of blood products (FFP, platelets, 
      cryoprecipitate) transfused, transfusion-related side effects, procedure-related 
      complications other than bleeding, hospital length of stay and survival. 
      DISCUSSION: We anticipate that this project will lead to improved prognostication 
      of patients with cirrhosis, in terms of their peri-procedural bleeding risk. We 
      hope to show that a significant proportion of cirrhotic patients, deemed 
      coagulopathic on the basis of standard coagulation tests such as INR and platelet 
      count, are actually in a haemostatic balance and thus do not require prophylactic 
      blood product, leading to decreased and more efficient blood component use. TRIAL 
      REGISTRATION: RECIPE has been prospectively registered with the Australia and New 
      Zealand Clinical Trials Registry on the 30th April 2019 ( ACTRN12619000644167 ).

TI  - Construction and validation of a nomogram for hepatocellular carcinoma patients 
      based on HCC-GRIm score.
PG  - 12013-12024

AB  - PURPOSE: To construct a nomogram for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients base 
      on HCC-GRIm score. METHODS: Clinical cases of HCC patients diagnosed at Hunan 
      Integrated Traditional Chinese and Western Medicine Hospital were included, and 
      these were randomly divided into the training cohort (n = 219) and the validation 
      cohort (n = 94), and those patients were divided into low GRIm-Score group 
      (scores 0, 1, and 2) and high GRIm-Score group (scores 3, 4, and 5). In the 
      training cohort, independent risk factors were determined by Cox regression 
      analysis, and a nomogram was constructed by independent risk factors. The 
      efficiency and the clinical applicability of nomograms were evaluated using ROC 
      curves, calibration plot, and the decision curve (DCA), and the patients were 
      divided into high-risk, middle-risk, and low-risk groups according to total score 
      of nomogram. RESULTS: Compared to low HCC-GRIm score group, high HCC-GRIm score 
      group with BCLC stage is more advanced (P < 0.001), and fewer patients received 
      TACE (P = 0.005) and surgical treatment (P = 0.001). There was higher rate of the 
      presence of vascular invasion (P < 0.001) and distant metastasis (P < 0.001). 
      Multivariate Cox regression analysis screened 4 independent risk factors to 
      construct a nomogram of HCC patients, including HCC-GRIm score, BCLC stage, 
      albumin-to-globulin ratio (AGR), and glutamyl trans-peptidase (GGT). The 
      consistency index (C-index) of the nomogram of the training was 0.843 
      (0.832-0.854) and the validation was 0.870 (0.856-0.885). The time-dependent 
      parameter showed the AUC values of the training cohort at 1, 3, and 5 years were 
      0.954 (95% CI 0.929-0.980), 0.952 (95% CI 0.919-0.985), and 925 (95% CI 
      0.871-0.979), while the AUC values of validation cohort at 1, 3, and 5 years were 
      0.974 (95% CI 0.950-0.998), 0.965 (95% CI 0.931-0.999), and 0.959 (95% CI 
      0.898-1.021). The calibration plot showed the nomogram fits well onto perfect 
      curves, and the DCA curve showed the net benefit of the nomogram at a certain 
      probability threshold is significantly higher than the net benefit of the BCLC 
      stage at the same threshold probability. Finally, all patients were divided into 
      high-risk, middle-risk, and low-risk groups based on the total score of nomogram, 
      and it showed effectively to identify high-risk patients. CONCLUSION: The 
      nomogram constructed by the independent risk factors can predict the prognosis of 
      HCC patients, providing an effective tool with clinical workers to evaluate the 
      prognosis and survival time of HCC patients.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: To evaluate the role of stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) in 
      hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients with inferior vena cava tumour thrombus 
      (IVCTT) who are not suitable for other loco-regional therapies. METHODS: This is 
      an observational retrospective study done between May 2020 and April 2022. The 
      data of 17 patients who underwent SBRT were collected. Patients of Child-Pugh 
      score (CPS) A5-B7 and along with a liver reserve of ≥700 cc were included. Local 
      control (LC), overall survival (OS) and adverse events including hepatic 
      decompensation were carefully recorded. RESULTS: In the cohort, the tumour 
      thrombus was extended to the right atrium in nine (52.9%) patients, and regional 
      nodal and lung were found in 60% and 31.4% of patients respectively. The median 
      gross tumour volume (GTV) was 745 cc (107-1,650 cc). The median SBRT dose 
      prescription was 35 Gy (25-45 Gy) in 5-10 fractions. At 6 months, LC and OS were 
      80% and 75% respectively. On multivariate analysis, an ALBI score >-2.36 was 
      found to be the predictor for the poor OS. Post-SBRT, a change in CPs by 2 points 
      was observed in one patient (5.9%) which was managed conservatively. 
      Post-radiation, improvement in pain and discomfort was observed in 92.3% and 87% 
      of patients, respectively and bone metastasis related pain was also resolved. 
      CONCLUSION: Stereotactic body radiotherapy is a safe and feasible option for HCC 
      patients with IVC and right atrium tumour thrombosis. It not only improves the 
      quality of life but also results in good LC and OS with acceptable toxicity. SBRT 
      should be considered in a multidisciplinary fashion for patients presenting with 
      tumour thrombosis extending to IVC and the right atrium.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Current predictors are largely unsatisfied for early recurrence (ER) 
      of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) after thermal ablation. We aimed to explore the 
      prognostic value of peripheral immune factors (PIFs) for better ER prediction of 
      HCC after thermal ablation. METHODS: Patients who received peripheral blood 
      mononuclear cells (PBMCs) tests before thermal ablation were included. Clinical 
      parameters and 18 PIFs were selected to construct Model(Clin), Model(PIFs) and 
      the hybrid Model(PIFs-Clin). Model performances were evaluated using area under 
      the curve (AUC), and recurrence-free survival (RFS) were analyzed by Kaplan-Meier 
      analysis and log-rank tests. RESULTS: 244 patients were included and were 
      randomly divided in 3:1 ratio to discovery and validation cohorts. Clinical 
      parameters including tumor size and AFP, and PIFs including neutrophils, 
      platelets, CD3(+)CD16(+)CD56(+) NKT and CD8(+)CD28(-) T lymphocytes were 
      selected. The Model(PIFs-Clin) showed increase in predictive performance compared 
      with Model(Clin), with the AUC improved from 0.664 (95%CI:0.588-0.740) to 0.801 
      (95%CI:0.734-0.867) in discovery cohort (p < 0.0001), and from 0.645 
      (95%CI:0.510-0.781) to 0.737(95%CI:0.608-0.865) in validation cohort 
      (p = 0.1006). Model(PIFs-Clin) enabled ER risk stratification of patients. 
      Patients predicted in Model(PIFs-Clin) high-risk subgroup had a poor RFS compared 
      with those predicted as Model(PIFs-Clin) low-risk subgroup, with the median RFS 
      was 18.00 month versus 100.78 month in discovery cohort (p < 0.0001); and 
      24.00 month versus 60.35 month in validation cohort (p = 0.288). Patients in 
      different risk subgroups exhibited distinct peripheral immune contexture. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Peripheral immune cells aiding clinical parameters boosted the 
      prediction ability for ER of HCC after thermal ablation, which be helpful for 
      pre-ablation ER risk stratification.

AB  - We assess the longitudinal tumor growth inhibition (TGI) metrics and overall 
      survival (OS) predictions applied to patients with advanced biliary tract cancer 
      (BTC) enrolled in IMbrave151 a multicenter randomized phase II, double-blind, 
      placebo-controlled trial evaluating the efficacy and safety of atezolizumab with 
      or without bevacizumab in combination with cisplatin plus gemcitabine. Tumor 
      growth rate (KG) was estimated for patients in IMbrave151. A pre-existing TGI-OS 
      model for patients with hepatocellular carcinoma in IMbrave150 was modified to 
      include available IMbrave151 study covariates and KG estimates and used to 
      simulate IMbrave151 study outcomes. At the interim progression-free survival 
      (PFS) analysis (98 patients, 27 weeks follow-up), clear separation in tumor 
      dynamic profiles with a faster shrinkage rate and slower KG (0.0103 vs. 
      0.0117 week(-1) ; tumor doubling time 67 vs. 59 weeks; KG geometric mean ratio of 
      0.84) favoring the bevacizumab containing arm was observed. At the first interim 
      analysis for PFS, the simulated OS hazard ratio (HR) 95% prediction interval (PI) 
      of 0.74 (95% PI: 0.58-0.94) offered an early prediction of treatment benefit 
      later confirmed at the final analysis, observed HR of 0.76 based on 159 treated 
      patients and 34 weeks of follow-up. This is the first prospective application of 
      a TGI-OS modeling framework supporting gating of a phase III trial. The findings 
      demonstrate the utility for longitudinal TGI and KG geometric mean ratio as 
      relevant end points in oncology studies to support go/no-go decision making and 
      facilitate interpretation of the IMbrave151 results to support future development 
      efforts for novel therapeutics for patients with advanced BTC.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: The feasibility and efficacy of surgical resection following 
      systemic therapy for intermediate-stage hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) beyond the 
      Up-to-7 criteria is unclear. The combination of lenvatinib (LEN) and 
      transcatheter arterial chemoembolisation (TACE), termed LEN-TACE sequential 
      therapy, has shown a high response rate and survival benefit in patients with 
      intermediate-stage HCC. This trial aims to evaluate the efficacy and safety of 
      LEN-TACE sequential therapy and the feasibility of surgical resection for 
      intermediate-stage HCC beyond the Up-to-7 criteria. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: This is 
      a multicentre, single-arm, prospective clinical trial. Thirty patients with 
      intermediate-stage HCC beyond the Up-to-7 criteria will be enrolled. Patients 
      eligible for this study will undergo LEN-TACE sequential therapy in which LEN is 
      administered for 4 weeks, followed by TACE, and then further LEN for another 4 
      weeks. Patients will be assessed for efficacy of LEN-TACE sequential therapy and 
      resectability, and surgical resection will be performed if the HCC is considered 
      radically resectable. The primary outcome of this study is the resection rate 
      after LEN-TACE sequential therapy. The secondary outcomes are the objective 
      response rate of LEN-TACE sequential therapy, safety, curative resection rate, 
      overall survival and recurrence-free survival. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: This 
      trial was approved by the Institutional Review Board of Hiroshima University, 
      Japan (approval no. CRB210003), and has been registered with the Japan Registry 
      of Clinical Trials (jRCTs061220007). The results of this study will be submitted 
      for publication in a peer-reviewed journal and shared with the scientific 
      community at international conferences. TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: jRCTs061220007

TI  - Phase I/II study of PexaVec in combination with immune checkpoint inhibition in 
      refractory metastatic colorectal cancer.
LID - 10.1136/jitc-2022-005640 [doi]
LID - e005640
AB  - BACKGROUND: Oncolytic immunotherapy represents a unique therapeutic platform for 
      the treatment of cancer. Here, we evaluated the safety and efficacy of the 
      combination of pexastimogene devacirepvec (PexaVec) plus durvalumab 
      (anti-programmed death ligand 1) with and without tremelimumab (anti-cytotoxic 
      T-lymphocyte associated protein 4) in patients with standard chemotherapy 
      refractory mismatch repair proficient (pMMR) metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) 
      in a phase I/II trial. METHODS: Adult patients with histologically confirmed 
      advanced pMMR mCRC, who had progressed on at least two prior lines of systemic 
      chemotherapy were studied in four cohorts. Patients received four doses of 
      PexaVec IV at a dose of 3×10(8) plaque forming units (pfu) (dose level 1) or 
      1×10(9) pfu (dose level 2) every 2 weeks. Twelve days after the first PexaVec 
      administration, patients received either 1500 mg of durvalumab every 28 days 
      alone or an additional single dose of 300 mg tremelimumab on day 1. Responses 
      were assessed every 8 weeks by CT or MRI. AEs were recorded. The primary 
      endpoints were safety and feasibility. Secondary endpoints included 
      progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival. Paired tumor samples and 
      peripheral blood were collected to perform immune monitoring. RESULTS: 
      Thirty-four patients with mCRC enrolled on to the study: 16 patients in the 
      PexaVec/durvalumab cohorts and 18 patients in the PexaVec/durvalumab/tremelimumab 
      cohorts. Overall, the combination of PexaVec plus immune checkpoint inhibitors 
      did not result in any unexpected toxicities. Most common toxicities observed were 
      fever and chills after PexaVec infusion. Two cases of grade 3 colitis, one case 
      of a grade 2 myositis and one case of grade 3 hypotension resulted in 
      discontinuation of immune checkpoint inhibitor and PexaVec treatment, 
      respectively. The median PFS in the PexaVec/durvalumab/tremelimumab cohorts was 
      2.3 months (95% CI: 2.2 to 3.2 months) vs 2.1 months (95% CI: 1.7 to 2.8 months; 
      p=0.57) in the PexaVec/durvalumab cohorts. Flow cytometry analysis of peripheral 
      blood mononuclear cells revealed an increase in Ki67(+)CD8(+) T cells on 
      treatment. CONCLUSION: PexaVec in combination with durvalumab and tremelimumab is 
      safe and tolerable. No unexpected toxicities were observed. The combination of 
      PexaVec/durvalumab/tremelimumab demonstrated potential clinical activity in 
      patients with pMMR mCRC, but further studies are needed to identify the 
      predictive biomarkers. TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: NCT03206073.

TI  - Racial Disparities in Treatment Initiation and Outcomes of Chronic Hepatitis B 
      Virus Infection in North America.
PG  - e237018
LID - 10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2023.7018 [doi]
LID - e237018
AB  - IMPORTANCE: Disparities in treatment initiation may affect outcomes, but data on 
      racially diverse populations with chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection are 
      limited. OBJECTIVE: To examine whether HBV treatment initiation and outcomes 
      differ among racial groups. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: From January 14, 
      2011, to January 28, 2018, hepatitis B surface antigen-positive adults (age ≥18 
      years) not receiving anti-HBV therapy were enrolled and followed up at weeks 12, 
      24, and every 24 weeks thereafter in a multicenter longitudinal cohort study 
      (Hepatitis B Research Network [HBRN] adult cohort study) conducted in North 
      America. The last study visit and data collection were completed January 28, 
      2019. Data were analyzed from August 27, 2021, to August 25, 2022. All HBRN 
      participants were included unless they had acute HBV, HIV, hepatitis C or D, less 
      than 24-weeks of follow-up after enrollment, initiated treatment at or 
      immediately after enrollment, or had unknown race. EXPOSURES: Participants had 
      clinical and laboratory assessments and could receive anti-HBV treatment after 
      enrollment. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Hepatitis B virus treatment initiation 
      and major adverse liver outcomes (hepatic decompensation, hepatocellular 
      carcinoma, liver transplant, and death). RESULTS: Of 1550 participants, 193 (12%) 
      were African American or Black, 1157 (75%) were Asian, 157 (10%) were White, and 
      43 (3%) were other races; 789 (51%) were women, and the median age was 41.2 (IQR, 
      32.9-51.6) years. Sociodemographic and virologic parameters differed between 
      groups. During 5727 person-years of follow-up, 504 participants initiated 
      treatment, with incidences of 4.8 per 100 person-years in African American or 
      Black individuals, 9.9 per 100 person-years in Asian individuals, 6.6 per 100 
      person-years in White individuals, and 7.9 per 100 person-years in those of other 
      races (P < .001). A lower proportion (14%) of African American or Black 
      participants met treatment criteria compared with Asian (22%) and White (27%) 
      individuals (P = .01). The cumulative probabilities of treatment initiation after 
      meeting the criteria were not significantly different among racial groups 
      (African American or Black, 0.45; Asian, 0.38; White, 0.40 at 48 weeks and 
      African American or Black, 0.45; Asian, 0.51; White, 0.51 at 72 weeks; P = .68). 
      The incidence of major adverse liver outcomes was 0.1 per 100 person-years and 
      did not differ by race. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this observational study of 
      chronic HBV, African American or Black participants were less likely than 
      individuals of other races to meet treatment criteria, but among those who did, 
      HBV treatment receipt did not differ significantly by race or socioeconomic 
      factors. Not all eligible participants initiated treatment, but adverse liver 
      outcomes were rare. These findings may not be generalizable to patients with 
      chronic HBV receiving care in other settings.

TI  - Efficacy and safety of lenvatinib plus gefitinib in lenvatinib-resistant 
      hepatocellular carcinomas: a prospective, single-arm exploratory trial.
PG  - 359

AB  - Lenvatinib, a multi-kinase inhibitor, has been approved as first-line treatment 
      for advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), but its efficacy is limited. We have 
      shown previously that lenvatinib and epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine 
      kinase inhibitor (EGFR-TKI) combination therapy overcomes lenvatinib resistance 
      in HCC with high level of EGFR expression (EGFR(high)). We present here the 
      results of a single-arm, open-label, exploratory study of lenvatinib plus the 
      EGFR-TKI gefitinib for patients with HCC resistance to lenvatinib (NCT04642547; 
      n = 30). Only patients with EGFR(high) HCC and progressive disease after 
      lenvatinib treatment were recruited in the study. The most frequent adverse 
      events of all grades were fatigue (27 patients; 90%), followed by rash (25 
      patients; 83.3%), diarrhea (24 patients; 80%), and anorexia (12 patients; 40%). 
      Among 30 patients, 9 (30%) achieved a confirmed partial response and 14 (46.7%) 
      had stable disease according to mRECIST criteria. Based on RECIST1.1, 5 (16.7%) 
      achieved a confirmed partial response and 18 (60%) had stable disease. The 
      estimated median progression free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) time 
      were 4.4 months (95% CI: 2.5 to 5.9) and13.7 months (95% CI: 9.0 to NA), 
      respectively. The objective response rate (ORR) of the patients in the present 
      study compares very favorable to that seen for the two approved second line 
      treatments for HCC (cabozantinib ORR of 4%; regorafenib ORR of 11%). Given that 
      this combination was well-tolerated, a further clinical study of this combination 
      is warranted.

TI  - Prognosis Following Sustained Virologic Response in Korean Chronic Hepatitis C 
      Patients Treated with Sofosbuvir-Based Treatment: Data from a Multicenter 
      Prospective Observational Study up to 7 Years.
LID - 10.3390/medicina60071132 [doi]
LID - 1132
AB  - Background and Objectives: Chronic hepatitis C (CHC) can be cured with 
      direct-acting antiviral (DAA) therapy. In Korea, sofosbuvir (SOF) and ledipasvir 
      (LDV)/SOF were launched in 2016. Patients who achieve a sustained virologic 
      response (SVR) following DAA treatment are predicted to have a favorable 
      prognosis. Nevertheless, little is known regarding the prognosis of Korean CHC 
      patients who receive SOF-based treatment and achieve SVR. Therefore, the purpose 
      of this study was to look into the long-term outcomes for these patients. 
      Materials and Methods: This was a prospective, multicenter observational study. 
      CHC patients were enrolled who, following SOF or LDV/SOF treatment, had achieved 
      SVR. The last day for follow-up was December 2023. The primary endpoint was HCC 
      occurrence, which was checked at least once per year. Results: A total of 516 
      patients were included in this analysis, with a median follow-up duration of 39.0 
      months. Among them, 231 were male patients (44.8%), with a median age of 62.0 
      years. Genotypes were 1 (90, 17.4%), 2 (423, 82.0%), and 3 (3, 0.6%). The 
      combination of SOF plus ribavirin was the most common treatment (394, 76.4%). In 
      total, 160 patients were cirrhotic (31.0%), and the mean Child-Pugh score was 
      5.1. Within a maximum of 7 years, 21 patients (4.1%) developed HCC. Patients with 
      HCC were older (69 vs. 61 years, p = 0.013) and had a higher cirrhosis incidence 
      (81.0 vs. 28.9%, p < 0.001), higher AFP (6.0 vs. 3.3, p = 0.003) and higher APRI 
      (0.8 vs. 0.5, p = 0.005). Age over 65 (p = 0.016) and cirrhosis (p = 0.005) were 
      found to be significant risk factors for HCC by Cox regression analysis. 
      Conclusions: Patients who achieved SVR with SOF-based treatment had a relatively 
      favorable prognosis. However, the risk of HCC was not eliminated, especially in 
      older and cirrhotic patients. Therefore, routine follow-up, surveillance, and 
      early treatment are required.

AB  - Bile duct cancer is the second most common primary liver cancer, with most 
      diagnoses occurring in the advanced stages. This leads to a poor survival rate, 
      which means a technique capable of reliably detecting pre-cancer in the bile duct 
      is urgently required. Unfortunately, radiological imaging lacks adequate accuracy 
      for distinguishing dysplastic and benign biliary ducts, while endoscopic 
      techniques, which can directly assess the bile duct lining, often suffer from 
      insufficient sampling. Here, we report an endoscopic optical light scattering 
      technique for clinical evaluation of the malignant potential of the bile duct. 
      This technique employs an ultraminiature spatial gating fiber optic probe 
      compatible with cholangioscopes and endoscopic retrograde 
      cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) catheters. The probe allowed us to investigate 
      the internal cellular composition of the bile duct epithelium with light 
      scattering spectroscopy (LSS) and phenotypic properties of the underlying 
      connective tissue with diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (DRS). In a pilot in vivo 
      double-blind prospective study involving 29 patients undergoing routine ERCP 
      procedures, the technique detected malignant transformation with 97% accuracy, 
      showing that biliary duct pre-cancer can be reliably identified in vivo 
      non-invasively.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study investigates the impact of transvascular antitumor 
      interventional therapies on immune cell dynamics and its correlation with disease 
      control and progression-free survival (PFS) in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) 
      patients. METHODS: A single-center observational case-control study was conducted 
      with 119 HCC patients. Transvascular antitumor interventional therapy were 
      administered based on patient-specific evaluations. Peripheral blood samples were 
      collected before and within 28 days after the first treatment to analyze 
      lymphocyte subsets and other immune cells. RESULTS: Higher counts of total white 
      blood cells (WBCs), lymphocytes, monocytes, and basophils were significantly 
      associated with disease control rate. Subgroup analysis revealed that abnormal 
      BMI, diabetes, infection, and multiple lesions were significantly associated with 
      T cell abnormalities. Age, abnormal BMI, hypertension, and abnormal AFP were 
      linked to total T cell abnormalities. NK cells, B cells, Th cells, Tc/Ts cells, 
      and CD4/CD8 ratios did not show significant differences in PFS probabilities. 
      CONCLUSION: Higher counts of WBCs, lymphocytes, monocytes, and basophils, play a 
      crucial role in the effectiveness of HCC interventional therapy.

AB  - In recent years, direct-acting antivirals (DAAs) have dramatically improved the 
      sustained virological response (SVR) rates in chronic hepatitis C (CHC) patients 
      with their favorable safety and efficacy. However, there is a lack of data on the 
      long-term prognosis of DAA therapy for CHC patients after achieving SVR in the 
      real world. The aim of this study was to evaluate the long-term clinical 
      prognosis of patients with chronic hepatitis C treated by DAA after achieving 
      SVR. This study was a single-center, retrospective, observational study that 
      included 243 CHC patients who reached SVR after DAA treatment in the Third 
      Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University from January 2017 to December 2021, 
      with a median follow-up period (FUP) of 24 months, to assess the long-term 
      prognosis and clinical outcomes of CHC patients who reached SVR by DAA treatment. 
      A total of 243 patients were enrolled in this study, 151 patients were male, the 
      mean age of this study was 46.7 ± 12.3 years old, and 23.0% (n = 56) patients 
      were cirrhosis in the baseline. At the end of follow-up, 9 patients (3.7%) 
      progressed to hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), and patients with cirrhosis at 
      baseline (n = 5) had a significantly higher risk of HCC compared with 
      noncirrhotic patients (n = 4; OR = 4.485, 95% CI: 1.162-17.318, P = .029); 2.9% 
      patients (n = 7) relapsed at the median FUP of 12 months, and patients with 
      genotype 3b had a significantly higher risk of relapsing than those without 
      genotype 3b (OR = 18.48, P = .002, 95% CI: 2.866-119.169). ALT, AST, and ALB all 
      showed improvement at the end of treatment compared with the baseline, remaining 
      at normal levels during FUP meanwhile. The DAA-induced SVR was durable, with 
      conspicuous improvement in clinical outcomes. Nevertheless, patients, especially 
      patients with cirrhosis, still exist the risk of appearance of HCC after reaching 
      SVR. Therefore, regular surveillance and monitoring is necessary even after 
      patients reached SVR.

LID - e2200140
AB  - PURPOSE: To apply target trial emulation to explore the potential impact of 
      eligibility criteria on the primary outcome of a randomized controlled trial. 
      METHODS: Simulations of a real-world explanatory trial of transarterial 
      radioembolization for advanced unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma with portal 
      vein invasion were performed to examine the effects of cohort specification on 
      survival outcomes and patient sample size. Simulations comprised 24 different 
      permutations of the trial varied on three disease nonspecific eligibility 
      parameters. Treatment and control arms for these emulated trials were drawn from 
      the National Cancer Database and matched by treatment propensity. Target trial 
      emulation served as the causal framework for this analysis, allowing the 
      architecture of a true controlled experiment to address forms of bias routinely 
      encountered in comparative effectiveness studies involving real-world 
      observational data. RESULTS: Twenty-four propensity score-matched cohorts 
      comprising a wider clinical spectrum of patients than specified by the original 
      target trial were successfully generated using the National Cancer Database. The 
      arms for each of the emulated trials demonstrated exchangeability across all 
      eligibility criteria and other clinical covariates. Significant treatment 
      benefits were associated with only a narrow range of eligibility criteria, 
      indicating that the original target trial was well specified. CONCLUSION: The 
      impact of patient selection on treatment outcomes can be studied using target 
      trial emulation. This analytical framework can furthermore serve to leverage 
      existing real-world data to inform the task of cohort specification for a 
      randomized controlled trial, facilitating a more data-driven approach for this 
      important step in clinical trial design.

TI  - Nonalcoholic Fatty Liver Disease and Ethnicity: Lessons Learned from the Arab 
      Population in Israel.

AB  - Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is the most common liver disease. We 
      aimed to investigate the potential similarities and differences regarding the 
      disease among Arabs and Jews. Retrospective study included all patients older 
      than 18 years with NAFLD diagnosis according to ICD-10 codes. Data regarding 
      demographics, comorbidities, and outcomes were retrieved using the MdClone 
      platform from "Clalit" in Israel. Data concerning 34,090 Arab patients and 
      173,500 Jewish patients with NAFLD were included. Arab patients were 
      significantly younger at diagnosis (35.0 ± 13 years vs. 43.6 ± 15 years, 
      p < 0.001) and had higher rates of obesity and diabetes mellitus (69.5% vs. 56.5% 
      and 27.0% vs. 22.7%, p < 0.001, respectively). Arab patients had higher rates of 
      cirrhosis and portal hypertension-related complications (2.5% vs. 2.0%, 
      p < 0.001), esophageal varices (0.9% vs. 0.5%, p < 0.001), spontaneous bacterial 
      peritonitis (0.3% vs. 0.1%, p < 0.001), and hepatorenal syndrome (0.3% vs. 0.1%, 
      p < 0.001). There was no significant difference in the prevalence of 
      hepatocellular carcinoma between study groups (0.4% vs. 0.5%, p = 0.156). Liver 
      transplantation was performed in 0.2% of Arab NAFLD patients compared to 0.07% of 
      Jewish NAFLD patients (p < 0.001). Lower rates of all-cause mortality were found 
      among the Arab NAFLD patients versus Jewish NAFLD patients (7.7% versus 11.5%, 
      p < 0.001). According to the Cox regression model, Arab ethnicity is a risk 
      factor for death with OR of 1.36. Significant differences regarding 
      comorbidities, complications, liver transplantations rates, and all-cause 
      mortality were found among NAFLD patients of different ethnicities, hence 
      specific population need specific consideration in prevention, early diagnosis 
      and follow up.

TI  - Prospective Series of Transarterial Chemoembolization of Metastatic Colorectal 
      Cancer to the Liver with 30-60 μm Microspheres Loaded with Irinotecan.
PG  - 880-890
LID - 10.1007/s00270-023-03446-6 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: To describe safety and clinical outcomes among patients with metastatic 
      colorectal cancer (mCRC) to the liver treated with transarterial 
      chemoembolization with HepaSphere™ Microspheres 30-60 μm loaded with irinotecan 
      (ΙRI-HEP-TACE). MATERIAL AND METHODS: In this prospective study (NCT04866290), 
      100 adults with confirmed mCRC to the liver who were ineligible for resection 
      were enrolled and followed up to 24 months or death. Study outcomes among Salvage 
      (patients not tolerating more cycles of chemotherapy) and Non-salvage patients 
      included overall survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS), objective 
      response (OR), objective response rate (ORR), best tumor response (BTR), adverse 
      events (AEs), and pharmacokinetics of irinotecan and its active metabolite, 
      7-ethyl-10-hydroxy-camptothecin (SN38). RESULTS: The median age was 66 years 
      (range: 31-89). Median OS was 15.08 months (95% confidence interval [CI]: 
      12.33-17.25). PFS was 8.52 months (95% CI: 6.0-9.0; p < 0.001). ORR was 42.2% 
      (95% CI: 31.57-53.50) and 35.9% (95% CI: 25.57-47.62) based on modified RECIST 
      (Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors) and RECIST 1.1 criteria. BTR was 
      not significantly different between mRECIST and RECIST (p = 0.745). The 
      Non-salvage group had a statistically significant difference in median OS 
      relative to the Salvage group (15.3 vs. 3 months; p < 0.001). Pharmacokinetic 
      analyses demonstrated no correlation of OS with plasma concentration of 
      irinotecan and SN38 (all p > 0.05). Most AEs were Grade 2 (257/279), the most 
      common AE was right upper abdominal pain (180/279). One major AE (tumor rupture) 
      was reported. CONCLUSION: IRI-HEP-TACE is an alternative treatment for patients 
      with Non-salvage mCRC to the liver.

TI  - Subcentimeter hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) on gadoxetic-acid-enhanced MRI: less 
      frequent typical imaging features compared to 1-2 cm HCC but better prognosis 
      after surgical resection.
PG  - 3391-3400
LID - 10.1007/s00261-023-04024-7 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: To compare the imaging features, pathologic characteristics, and 
      survival outcomes between subcentimeter and 1-2 cm hepatocellular carcinoma 
      (HCC). METHODS: This retrospective observational study evaluated the imaging 
      features and medical records of patients with HCC smaller than 2 cm who underwent 
      surgical resection with preoperative gadoxetic-acid-enhanced MRI (EOB-MRI) from 
      January 2013 to December 2021. The incidence of EOB-MRI features and pathological 
      characteristics between the subcentimeter and 1-2 cm HCC were compared. The 
      recurrence-free survival (RFS), including early and overall tumor recurrence, and 
      overall survival (OS) were assessed. RESULTS: A total of 223 patients (82 with 
      subcentimeter HCC and 141 with 1-2 cm HCC, 179 men) were enrolled. Compared with 
      1-2 cm HCC, subcentimeter HCC showed fewer restricted diffusion (87.8 vs. 95.7%, 
      P = 0.027), portal-phase washout (58.5% vs. 73.8%, P = 0.013), typical 
      enhancement pattern (50.0% vs. 66.7%, P =0.014), and microvascular invasion (4.9% 
      vs. 14.9%, P = 0.022). Patients with subcentimeter HCC had higher RFS (P = 0.027) 
      and better OS (P = 0.029). The estimated RFS rates at 5 years was 83.3% for 
      subcentimeter HCC and 67.3% for 1-2 cm HCC, respectively. The estimated OS rates 
      at 5 years was 97.3% for subcentimeter HCC and 89.5% for 1-2 cm HCC, 
      respectively. CONCLUSION: Subcentimeter HCC showed less frequent EOB-MRI features 
      seen typically in 1-2 cm HCC but better survival outcomes. Therefore, tailored 
      early diagnostic criteria and immediate treatment for subcentimeter HCC may be 
      warranted.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Patients with alcohol-related cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma 
      (HCC) may have reduced survival compared to those with HCC related to other 
      causes. The impact of abstinence in alcohol-related HCC is unknown. We compared 
      access to curative treatment and the prognosis of patients with HCC according to 
      the cause of cirrhosis and evaluated the impact of abstinence on the prognosis of 
      patients with alcohol-related HCC. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Data for patients with 
      cirrhosis and HCC were prospectively collected in a single center. A logistic 
      regression model was used to identify factors associated with access to curative 
      treatment. Multivariate Fine and Gray proportional hazards models were used to 
      identify factors associated with 5-year survival after adjustment for lead-time 
      bias. RESULTS: Two hundred patients were included, 114 (57 %) with 
      non-alcohol-related HCC and 86 (43 %) with alcohol-related HCC (35 abstainers, 51 
      consumers). During follow-up, 21 patients were transplanted and 156 died. The 
      proportion of patients who had access to curative treatment was 65 % in 
      abstainers, 44 % in consumers, and 57 % in patients with non-alcohol-related 
      cirrhosis (p = 0.06). In multivariate analyses, abstinence was not associated 
      with better access to curative treatment. After adjustment for lead-time bias, 
      the 5-year cumulative incidence of overall death was significantly lower in 
      abstainers than in consumers and in patients with non-alcohol-related cirrhosis 
      (52 % vs. 78 % vs. 81 %, respectively, p = 0.04). In multivariate analyses, 
      abstainers had lower risk of death than consumers (SHR: 0.47, 95 % CI: 0.28-0.80, 
      p = 0.005). CONCLUSION: Abstinence improves the outcome of patients with 
      alcohol-related cirrhosis once HCC has occurred.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to investigate the efficacy of decision support 
      intervention on treatment knowledge, decision self-efficacy, decisional conflict, 
      and decision satisfaction in patients with hepatocellular cancer. The study was a 
      randomized controlled trial. In all, 69 patients with hepatocellular carcinoma 
      (HCC) were recruited and randomly assigned to a decision support group or a 
      control group. Data were collected at baseline, post-test, and follow-up using 
      self-report questionnaires. After controlling for baseline scores, the 
      between-group difference (95% confidence interval [CI]) for treatment-related 
      knowledge in post-test scores was 11.9 (6.1, 17.8). After controlling for 
      baseline scores, the between-group difference (95% CI) for decisional conflict 
      was -7.0 (-12.0, -2.0). There was no statistically significant between-group 
      difference in decision self-efficacy and decision satisfaction. Findings 
      supported the efficacy of decision support intervention to improve treatment 
      knowledge and reduce decisional conflict but had no significant effect on 
      decision self-efficacy and decision satisfaction in patients with HCC.

TI  - VIR-2218 (elebsiran) plus pegylated interferon-alfa-2a in participants with 
      chronic hepatitis B virus infection: a phase 2 study.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) remains a global concern, with 
      current treatments achieving low rates of HBsAg seroclearance. VIR-2218 
      (elebsiran), a small interfering RNA agent against HBV transcripts, reduces HBsAg 
      concentrations. We aimed to evaluate the safety and antiviral activity of 
      VIR-2218 with and without pegylated interferon-alpha-2a treatment in participants 
      with chronic HBV. METHODS: This open-label, phase 2 study was conducted at 23 
      sites in six countries (New Zealand, Australia, Hong Kong, Thailand, South Korea, 
      and Malaysia). Adults (aged 18-65 years) with chronic HBV infection without 
      cirrhosis and with HBsAg more than 50 IU/mL and HBV DNA less than 90 IU/mL who 
      were on continued nucleoside or nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI) 
      therapy for 2 months or longer were eligible. Participants were enrolled into one 
      of six cohorts to receive VIR-2218 200 mg subcutaneously every 4 weeks, with or 
      without 180 μg subcutaneous pegylated interferon-alfa-2a once per week. Cohort 1 
      received six doses of VIR-2218 (total 20 weeks); cohort 2 received six doses of 
      VIR-2218 starting at day 1, plus 12 doses of pegylated interferon-alfa-2a 
      starting at week 12 (total 24 weeks); cohort 3 received six doses of VIR-2218 and 
      24 doses of pegylated interferon-alfa-2a (total 24 weeks); cohort 4 received six 
      doses of VIR-2218 and up to 48 doses of pegylated interferon-alfa-2a (total 48 
      weeks); cohort 5 received up to 13 doses of VIR-2218 and up to 44 doses of 
      pegylated interferon-alfa-2a (total 48 weeks); and cohort 6 received three doses 
      of VIR-2218 and 12 doses of pegylated interferon-alfa-2a (total 12 weeks). The 
      primary endpoints were the incidence of adverse events and clinical assessments 
      (including results of laboratory tests). Secondary endpoints were the mean 
      maximum reduction of serum HBsAg at any timepoint; the proportion of participants 
      with serum HBsAg seroclearance at any timepoint and for more than 6 months after 
      the end of treatment; and the proportion of participants with anti-HBs 
      seroconversion at any timepoint. For patients who were HBeAg-positive, we also 
      assessed the proportion with HBeAg seroclearance or anti-HBe seroconversion at 
      any timepoint. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03672188, and 
      is ongoing. FINDINGS: Between July 2, 2020, and Nov 2, 2021, 124 individuals were 
      screened for eligibility, 84 of whom were enrolled (15 in cohort 1, 15 in cohort 
      2, 18 in cohort 3, 18 in cohort 4, 13 in cohort 5, and five in cohort 6). 
      Participants were predominantly HBeAg-negative, Asian, and male (66 [79%] 
      participants were male and 18 [21%] were female). Most treatment emergent adverse 
      events were grades 1-2. Three (20%) participants in cohort 1, four (27%) in 
      cohort 2, eight (44%) in cohort 3, seven (39%) in cohort 4, six (46%) in cohort 
      5, and two (40%) in cohort 6 reported treatment-emergent adverse events related 
      to VIR-2218. 12 (80%) participants in cohort 2, 12 (67%) in cohort 3, 14 (78%) in 
      cohort 4, 13 (100%) in cohort 5, and three (60%) in cohort 6 reported 
      treatment-emergent adverse events related to pegylated interferon-alfa-2a. Two 
      (13%) participants in cohort 1 had elevations in alanine aminotransferase, 
      compared with 13 (87%) participants in cohort 2, 15 (83%) in cohort 3, 17 (94%) 
      in cohort 4, 11 (85%) in cohort 5, and three (60%) in cohort 6. The mean maximum 
      change from baseline at any timepoint in HBsAg concentration was -2·0 log(10) 
      IU/mL (95% CI -2·1 to -1·8) in cohort 1, -2·2 log(10) IU/mL (-2·5 to -1·8) in 
      cohort 2, -2·5 log(10) IU/mL (-2·8 to -2·1) in cohort 3, -2·4 log(10) IU/mL (-3·1 
      to -1·8) in cohort 4, -3·0 log(10) IU/mL (-3·7 to -2·3) in cohort 5, and -1·7 
      log(10) IU/mL (-2·1 to -1·4) in cohort 6. 11 participants (one in cohort 2, one 
      in cohort 3, five in cohort 4, and four in cohort 5) receiving VIR-2218 plus 
      pegylated interferon-alfa-2a had HBsAg seroclearance at any timepoint. Of these, 
      ten (91%; one in cohort 2, five in cohort 4, and four in cohort 5) had anti-HBs 
      seropositivity. Six participants (one in cohort 2, three in cohort 4, and two in 
      cohort 5) had sustained HBsAg seroclearance through to 24 weeks after the end of 
      treatment. No participants receiving VIR-2218 monotherapy (cohort 1) or VIR-2218 
      plus pegylated interferon-alfa-2a 12-week regimen (cohort 6) had HBsAg 
      seroclearance. 12 (42%) of 26 participants (one of four in cohort 1, two of six 
      in cohort 2, four of seven in cohort 3, four of six in cohort 4, and one of three 
      in cohort 5) who were HBeAg positive at baseline had HBeAg seroclearance or 
      anti-HBe seroconversion. INTERPRETATION: The results of this phase 2 study 
      support further development of VIR-2218 as a potential therapy for patients with 
      chronic HBV infection. Additional clinical trials of VIR-2218 with and without 
      pegylated interferon-alfa-2a in combination with an HBsAg-targeting monoclonal 
      antibody are ongoing. FUNDING: Vir Biotechnology.

AB  - Radiofrequency ablation (RFA) offers a minimally invasive treatment for small 
      hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), but it faces challenges such as high local 
      recurrence rates. This prospective study, conducted from January 2020 to July 
      2022, evaluated a novel approach using a three-channel, dual radiofrequency (RF) 
      generator with separable clustered electrodes to improve RFA's efficacy and 
      safety. The study employed a high-power, gradual, stepwise RFA method on HCCs 
      (≤ 4 cm), utilizing real-time ultrasound-computed tomography (CT)/magnetic 
      resonance imaging (MRI) fusion imaging. Involving 110 participants with 116 HCCs, 
      the study reported no major complications. Local tumor progression (LTP) and 
      intrahepatic remote recurrence (IRR) rates were low, with promising cumulative 
      incidences at 1, 2, and 3 years for LTP (0.9%, 3.6%, 7.0%) and IRR (13.9%, 20.5%, 
      31.4%). Recurrence-free survival (RFS) rates were similarly encouraging: LTP 
      (99.1%, 96.4%, 93.0%) and IRR (86.1%, 79.5%, 68.6%). This innovative gradual, 
      incremental high-power RFA technique, featuring a dual switching monopolar mode 
      and three electrodes, represents an effective and safer management option for 
      small HCCs. TRIAL REGISTRATION: clinicaltrial.gov identifier: NCT05397860, first 
      registered on 26/05/2022.

AB  - BACKGROUND: This study aims to construct and verify a nomogram model for 
      microvascular invasion (MVI) based on hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) tumor 
      characteristics and differential protein expressions, and explore the clinical 
      application value of the prediction model. METHODS: The clinicopathological data 
      of 200 HCC patients were collected and randomly divided into training set and 
      validation set according to the ratio of 7:3. The correlation between MVI 
      occurrence and primary disease, age, gender, tumor size, tumor stage, and 
      immunohistochemical characteristics of 13 proteins, including GPC3, CK19 and 
      vimentin, were statistically analyzed. Univariate and multivariate analyzes 
      identified risk factors and independent risk factors, respectively. A nomogram 
      model that can be used to predict the presence of MVI was subsequently 
      constructed. Then, receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve, calibration 
      curve, and decision curve analysis (DCA) were conducted to assess the performance 
      of the model. RESULTS: Multivariate logistic regression analysis indicated that 
      tumor size, GPC3, P53, RRM1, BRCA1, and ARG were independent risk factors for 
      MVI. A nomogram was constructed based on the above six predictors. ROC curve, 
      calibration, and DCA analysis demonstrated the good performance and the clinical 
      application potential of the nomogram model. CONCLUSIONS: The predictive model 
      constructed based on the clinical characteristics of HCC tumors and differential 
      protein expression patterns could be helpful to improve the accuracy of MVI 
      diagnosis in HCC patients.

TI  - Non-hypervascular hepatobiliary phase hypointense lesions detected in patients 
      with hepatocellular carcinoma: a post hoc analysis of SORAMIC trial to identify 
      risk factors for progression.
PG  - 493-500
LID - 10.1007/s00330-022-09000-1 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To identify clinical and imaging parameters associated with 
      progression of non-hypervascular hepatobiliary phase hypointense lesions during 
      follow-up in patients who received treatment for hepatocellular carcinoma. 
      METHODS: A total of 67 patients with 106 lesions were identified after screening 
      538 patients who underwent gadoxetic acid-enhanced MRI within the SORAMIC trial. 
      All patients were allocated to the trial treatment according to the trial scheme, 
      and 61 of 67 patients received systemic treatment with sorafenib (either alone or 
      combined with locoregional therapies) during the trial period. Follow-up images 
      after treatment according to trial scheme were reviewed for subsequent 
      hypervascularization or > 1 cm size increase. The correlation between progression 
      and several imaging and clinical parameters was assessed using univariable and 
      multivariable analyses. RESULTS: On a median 178 (range, 48-1072) days follow-up 
      period, progression was encountered in 18 (16.9%) lesions in 12 (17.9%) patients. 
      In univariable analysis size > 12.6 mm (p = 0.070), ECOG-PS (p = 0.025), 
      hypointensity at T1-weighted imaging (p = 0.028), hyperintensity at T2-weighted 
      imaging (p < 0.001), hyperintensity at DWI images (p = 0.007), and cirrhosis (p = 
      0.065) were correlated with progression during follow-up. Hyperintensity at T2 
      images (p = 0.011) was an independent risk factor for progression in 
      multivariable analysis, as well as cirrhosis (p = 0.033) and ECOG-PS (p = 0.030). 
      CONCLUSIONS: Non-hypervascular hepatobiliary phase hypointense lesions are 
      associated with subsequent progression after treatment in patients with HCC. T2 
      hyperintensity, diffusion restriction, cirrhosis, and higher ECOG-PS could 
      identify lesions with increased risk. These factors should be considered for 
      further diagnostic evaluation or treatment of such lesions. KEY POINTS: • 
      Non-hypervascular hepatobiliary phase hypointense lesions have considerable risk 
      of progression in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma receiving treatment. • 
      T2 hyperintensity, cirrhosis, ECOG-PS, and hyperintensity at DWI are associated 
      with increased risk of progression. • Non-hypervascular hepatobiliary phase 
      hypointense lesions should be considered in the decision-making process of 
      locoregional therapies, especially in the presence of these risk factors.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Accurate detection of Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) feeding vessels 
      during transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (TACE) is important for an 
      effective treatment, while limiting non-target embolization. This study aimed to 
      investigate the feasibility and accuracy of pre-TACE three dimensional (3D) CT 
      angiography for tumor-feeding vessels detection compared to DSA. METHODS: 
      Sixty-nine consecutive patients referred for TACE from May 2022 to May 2023 were 
      included. (3D) CT images were reconstructed from the pre-TACE diagnostic 
      multiphasic contrast enhanced CT images and compared with non-selective digital 
      subtraction angiography (DSA) images obtained during TACE for detection of HCC 
      feeding vessels. A "Ground truth" made by consensus between observers after 
      reviewing all available pre-TACE CT images, and DSA and CBCT images during TACE 
      to detect the true feeding vessels was the gold standard. Sensitivity, 
      specificity, negative predictive value (NPV), positive predictive value (PPV), 
      accuracy and ROC curve with AUC were calculated for each modality and compared. 
      RESULTS: A total of 136 active HCCs were detected in the 69 consecutive patients 
      included in the study. 185 feeding arteries were detected by 3D CT and DSA and 
      included in the analysis. 3D CT detection of feeding arteries revealed mean 
      sensitivity, specificity, PPV, NPV and accuracy of 91%, 71%, 98%, 36%, and 90%, 
      respectively, with mean AUC = 0.81. DSA detection of feeding arteries revealed 
      mean sensitivity, specificity, PPV, NPV, and accuracy of 80%, 58%, 96.5%, 16.5% 
      and 78%, respectively, with mean AUC = 0.69. CONCLUSIONS: Pre-TACE 3D CT 
      angiography has shown promise in improving the detection of HCC feeding vessels 
      compared to DSA. However, further studies are required to confirm these findings 
      across different clinical settings and patient populations. TRIAL REGISTRATION: 
      This study was prospectively registered at Clinicaltrials.gov with ID 
      NCT05304572; Date of registration: 2-4-2022.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to evaluate the feasibility, safety, and 
      short-term effectiveness of a high-power (150 W) microwave ablation (MWA) device 
      for tumor ablation in the lung, liver, and kidney. METHODS: Between December 2021 
      and June 2022, patients underwent high-power MWA for liver, lung, and kidney 
      tumors. A retrospective observational study was conducted in accordance with the 
      Declaration of Helsinki. The MWA system utilized a 150-W, 2.45-GHz microwave 
      generator (Emprint™ HP Ablation System, Medtronic). The study assessed technical 
      success, safety, and effectiveness, considering pre- and post-treatment diameter 
      and volume, lesion location, biopsy and/or cone beam computed tomography (CBCT) 
      usage, MWA ablation time, MWA power, and dose-area product (DAP). RESULTS: From 
      December 2021 to June 2022, 16 patients were enrolled for high-power MWA. Treated 
      lesions included hepatocellular carcinoma (10), liver metastasis from colon 
      cancer (1), liver metastasis from pancreatic cancer (1), squamous cell lung 
      carcinoma (2), renal cell carcinoma (1), and renal oncocytoma (1). Technical 
      success rate was 100%. One grade 1 complication (6.25%) was reported according to 
      CIRSE classification. Overall effectiveness was 92.8%. Pre- and post-treatment 
      mean diameters for liver lesions were 19.9 mm and 37.5 mm, respectively; for 
      kidney lesions, 34 mm and 35 mm; for lung lesions, 29.5 mm and 31.5 mm. Pre- and 
      post-treatment mean volumes for liver lesions were 3.4 ml and 24 ml, 
      respectively; for kidney lesions, 8.2 ml and 20.5 ml; for lung lesions, 10.2 ml 
      and 32.7 ml. The mean ablation time was 48 minutes for liver, 42.5 minutes for 
      lung, and 42.5 minutes for renal ablation. The mean DAP for all procedures was 
      40.83 Gcm(2). CONCLUSION: This preliminary study demonstrates the feasibility, 
      safety, and effectiveness of the new 150 W MWA device. Additionally, it shows 
      reduced ablation times for large lesions.

TI  - Preoperative Chemotherapy Followed by Hepatectomy for Potentially Resectable 
      UICC7 Stage IIIA, IIIB Hepatocellular Carcinoma; A Phase II Clinical Trial.
PG  - 239-245
LID - 10.2739/kurumemedj.MS6834010 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The Japanese guideline for therapeutic strategy in HCC does not 
      recognize any benefit of preoperative chemotherapy for potentially resectable 
      hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), and only upfront resec tion is recommended even 
      for an advanced HCC. Data on preoperative chemotherapy for advanced HCC is still 
      limited. Poor prognostic factors of HCC after resection are tumor more than 5 cm 
      in diameter, multiple lesions, and gross tumor thrombosis, which constitute UICC7 
      Stage IIIA and IIIB HCC. There are no prospective studies about preoperative 
      chemotherapy in these patients. AIM: To evaluate the benefit of preoperative 
      chemotherapy for UICC7 Stage IIIA and IIIB potentially resectable HCC. 
      DISCUSSION: Our recent study demonstrated that the 5-year overall survival rate 
      (OS) of patients diagnosed as UICC7 Stage IIIA and IIIB who had received upfront 
      resection was only 16.5%. In contrast, the 5-year OS of UICC7 Stage IIIA and IIIB 
      initially unresectable patients who had achieved conversion from unresectable to 
      resect able status under successful hepatic infusion chemotherapy prior to 
      resection was as high as 61.3%. Additionally, recent studies reported 
      transarterial chemoembolization achieved outcomes comparable with those of 
      resection. Therefore, we believe that patients with UICC7 Stage IIIA and IIIB 
      should be considered borderline resectable. To evaluate this hypothesis we 
      registered the present phase II clinical trial to assess the benefit of 
      preoperative chemo therapy followed by hepatectomy in potentially resectable 
      UICC7 Stage IIIA and IIIB HCC patients.

TI  - Predictive factors of 90-day mortality after curative hepatic resection for 
      hepatocellular carcinoma: a western single-center observational study.
PG  - 149
LID - 10.1007/s00423-024-03337-5 [doi]
LID - 149
AB  - PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to identify predictive risk factors associated 
      with 90-day mortality after hepatic resection (HR) in hepatocellular carcinoma 
      (HCC). METHODS: All patients undergoing elective resection for HCC from a single- 
      institutional and prospectively maintained database were included. Multivariate 
      regression analysis was conducted to identify pre- and intraoperative as well as 
      histopathological predictive factors of 90-day mortality after elective HR. 
      RESULTS: Between August 2004 and October 2021, 196 patients were enrolled (148 
      male /48 female). The median age of the study cohort was 68.5 years 
      (range19-84 years). The rate of major hepatectomy (≥ 3 segments) was 43.88%. 
      Multivariate analysis revealed patient age ≥ 70 years [HR 2.798; (95% CI 
      1.263-6.198); p = 0.011], preoperative chronic renal insufficiency [HR 3.673; 
      (95% CI 1.598-8.443); p = 0.002], Child-Pugh Score [HR 2.240; (95% CI 
      1.188-4.224); p = 0.013], V-Stage [HR 2.420; (95% CI 1.187-4.936); p = 0.015], 
      and resected segments ≥ 3 [HR 4.700; (95% 1.926-11.467); p = 0.001] as the major 
      significant determinants of the 90-day mortality. CONCLUSION: Advanced patient 
      age, pre-existing chronic renal insufficiency, Child-Pugh Score, extended hepatic 
      resection, and vascular tumor involvement were identified as significant 
      predictive factors of 90-day mortality. Proper patient selection and adjustment 
      of treatment strategies could potentially reduce short-term mortality.

      undergoing invasive procedures.
PG  - 180-189
LID - 10.1007/s12072-022-10421-9 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Probing efficacy and safety of lusutrombopag in Chinese chronic liver 
      disease (CLD) and severe thrombocytopenia (PLT < 50 × 10(9)/L) patients 
      undergoing elective invasive procedures. METHODS: In this double-blind, 
      parallel-group phase 3 study, 66 patients with CLD and severe thrombocytopenia 
      were randomized 2:1 to lusutrombopag or placebo arm treatment regimens for seven 
      days at 9 centers in China. Responders (PLT ≥ 50 × 10(9)/L that increased 
      to ≥ 20 × 10(9)/L from the baseline and not received rescue therapy for bleeding) 
      on Day 8 (the day after seven-day treatment) were assessed. PLT ≥ 50 × 10(9)/L on 
      or after Day 8 and within 2 days before invasive procedure (alternative criteria 
      for not requiring platelet transfusion) were also analyzed. Adverse events (AEs) 
      were recorded. RESULTS: The proportion of responders on Day 8 was evidently 
      higher (p = 0.0011) in the lusutrombopag group (43.2%, 19/44) versus placebo 
      (4.5%, 1/22). And 72.7% (32/44) patients receiving lusutrombopag met the 
      alternative criteria for not requiring platelet transfusion, while 18.2% (4/22) 
      in the placebo group. The median maximum PLT in lusutrombopag group increased to 
      80.5 × 10(9)/L, and median time to reach maximum was 14.5 days. Compared with 
      placebo, the lusutrombopag group had a lower incidence of bleeding events (6.8% 
      versus 13.6%), and only one patient had thrombotic-related AE. Overall, the 
      incidence of treatment-emergent AEs was comparable between two groups. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Lusutrombopag was effective in raising PLT, diminishing platelet 
      transfusion requirement, and documented a safety profile like the placebo in CLD 
      and severe thrombocytopenia patients in a Chinese cohort undergoing elective 
      invasive procedures. Chinese clinical trial registration number: CTR20192384.

AB  - AIM: We analyzed the association between the modified albumin-bilirubin (mALBI) 
      grade and therapeutic efficacy of atezolizumab plus bevacizumab (Atezo+Bev) for 
      the treatment of unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (u-HCC). METHODS: In this 
      retrospective observational study, we included 71 u-HCC patients treated with 
      Atezo+Bev between September 2020 and September 2021. Patients were grouped 
      corresponding to the mALBI grade at the start of treatment (mALBI 1+2a or mALBI 
      2b+3) and analyzed for therapeutic effect and the transition rate to secondary 
      treatment. RESULTS: According to the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid 
      Tumors, the overall response rate was significantly higher for the mALBI 1+2a 
      group, than for the mALBI 2b+3 group, with 26.2% and 3.4%, respectively. The 
      progression-free survival (PFS) was significantly longer in the mALBI 1+2a group 
      (10.5 months) than in the mALBI 2b+3 group (3.0 months). In the multivariate 
      analysis, an mALBI of 1+2a was found to be an independent factor of PFS. The rate 
      of second-line treatment with multi-targeted agents was also significantly higher 
      in the mALBI 1+2a group. CONCLUSIONS: In real-world practice, Atezo+Bev treatment 
      might have higher therapeutic efficacy in u-HCC patients with mALBI 1+2a.

TI  - Impact of cisplatin-induced acute kidney injury on long-term renal function in 
      patients with solid tumors.
PG  - 506-518
LID - 10.1007/s10157-023-02324-2 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The reality of cisplatin-induced acute kidney injury (CIA) and its 
      effects on long-term renal function remain unclear. The aim of this study was to 
      investigate the incidence and risk factors for CIA development, and if CIA is a 
      useful predictor of long-term renal dysfunction after cisplatin treatment. 
      METHODS: This was a retrospective, single-center, observational, longitudinal 
      follow-up, large cohort study in adult patients with solid tumors treated with 
      cisplatin-based systematic chemotherapy. Electronic medical records were used for 
      all demographic and medical data. AKI was defined by Kidney Disease Improving 
      Global Outcomes (KDIGO) criteria. We assessed long-term renal dysfunction using 
      %ΔeGFR/Y; (the last eGFR value during follow-up)-(the baseline eGFR)/(the 
      baseline eGFR)/year of follow-up × 100. RESULTS: A total of 2191 patients 
      received 8,482 cycles of cisplatin. CIA was observed 359 times (4.2%). 
      Significant risk factors for developing CIA, using multiple linear regression 
      analysis, included: cisplatin administration immediately before the onset of CIA 
      (p < 0.01), liver cancer (p = 0.02), colon cancer (p = 0.04), hypertension 
      (p = 0.03), high estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) (p < 0.01), and high 
      C-reactive protein (CRP) (p = 0.04). Significant risk factors for %ΔeGFR/Y, using 
      multivariate linear regression analysis, included: esophageal cancer (p < 0.01), 
      lung cancer (p < 0.01), pharyngeal cancer (p = 0.02), Head and neck cancer 
      (p < 0.01), liver cancer (p = 0.02), potassium (p < 0.01), and CIA (p < 0.01). 
      CONCLUSIONS: To our knowledge, this is the first study to show that CIA is a 
      significant predictive risk factor for long-term renal dysfunction after 
      cisplatin administration. Effective strategies are needed to prevent CIA in 
      cancer patients.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The efficacy of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccines in 
      preventing SARS-CoV-2 infection in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) 
      is not clear. METHODS: From January 2022 to October 2022, patients diagnosed with 
      HCC in a prospective, multicenter, observational cohort were analyzed. RESULTS: 
      One hundred and forty-one patients with (n = 107) or without COVID-19 vaccination 
      (n = 34) were included. The number of patients with severe or very severe 
      infection was relatively lower in the vaccinated group (3.7% vs. 11.8%, 
      p = 0.096). Median infection-free survival in the vaccinated group (14.0 vs. 
      8.3 months, p = 0.010) was significantly longer than that in the unvaccinated 
      group. COVID-19 vaccination (hazard ratio (HR) HR = 0.47), European Cooperative 
      Oncology Group performance score = 0 (HR = 2.06), and extrahepatic spread 
      (HR = 0.28) were found to be the independent predictive factors for 
      infection-free survival. CONCLUSION: COVID-19 vaccines could effectively reduce 
      the SARS-Cov-2 infection in patients with HCC.

AB  - PURPOSE: To compare the therapeutic response and clinical outcome of CT-guided 
      percutaneous microwave (MWA) and radiofrequency ablation (RFA) for the treatment 
      of small- and medium-sized HCC. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this prospective trial, 
      50 patients with HCC were randomly assigned to MWA or RFA treatment. MRI was 
      performed 24 h before and after ablation and subsequently in 3-month intervals. 
      Ablation volumes, ablation durations, adverse events (AE), technique efficacy, 
      technical success, local tumor progression (LTP), disease-free survival (DFS), 
      intrahepatic distant recurrence (IDR), and overall survival (OS) rates were 
      evaluated. RESULTS: The mean ablation volume was 66.5 cm³ for MWA and 29.2  cm³ 
      for RFA (p < 0.01). The mean ablation durations for MWA and RFA were 
      11.2 ± 4.0 min and 16.3 ± 4.7 min, respectively (p < 0.01). Six mild AEs were 
      documented (p > 0.05). All treatments had a technical success rate and a 
      technique efficacy rate of 100 % (50/50, p = 1.00). LTP within 2 years occurred 
      in 1/25 (4 %) in the MWA group and in 4/25 (16 %) in the RFA group (p = 0.06). 
      IDR within 2 years was 8/25 (32 %) for MWA and 14/25 (56 %) for RFA (p < 0.05). 
      The median DFS was 24.5 months and 13.4 months for MWA and RFA, respectively 
      (p = 0.02). The 1-, 2-, 3-year OS rates were 100 %, 80 %, 72 % in the MWA group 
      and 72 %, 64 %, 60 % in the RFA group, respectively (p ≥ 0.14). CONCLUSION: The 
      clinical outcome after MWA or RFA for HCC treatment was very similar with no 
      significant differences in LTP or OS. However, MWA shows a trend toward better 
      DFS with fewer IDRs than RFA. KEY POINTS: · MWA allows for larger ablation 
      volumes and a shorter treatment duration compared to RFA in patients with HCC.. · 
      MWA shows a trend toward better disease-free survival and fewer intrahepatic 
      distant recurrences compared to RFA.. · The three-year survival rates show no 
      significant difference between the two methods..

TI  - Outcomes of patients with hepatorenal syndrome undergoing liver transplantation 
      in the era of terlipressin.
PG  - 881-888
LID - 10.1097/MEG.0000000000002584 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The efficacy of terlipressin in improving pre-liver transplant renal 
      function in hepatorenal syndrome (HRS) has been well documented, however, its 
      impact on post-transplant renal function remains poorly described. This study 
      aims to describe the impact of HRS and terlipressin on post-liver transplant 
      renal function and survival. METHODS: A single-centre, retrospective, 
      observational study was conducted to identify post-transplant outcomes of 
      patients diagnosed with HRS undergoing liver transplant (HRS cohort) and those 
      undergoing transplant for non-HRS, non-hepatocellular carcinoma cirrhotic 
      indications (comparator cohort) between January 1997 and March 2020. The primary 
      outcome was serum creatinine at 180 days post-liver transplant. Other renal 
      outcomes and overall survival were secondary outcomes. RESULTS: 109 patients with 
      HRS and 502 comparator patients underwent liver transplant. The comparator cohort 
      was younger than the HRS cohort (53 vs. 57 years, P < 0.001). The median 
      creatinine at day 180 post-transplant was higher in the HRS transplant group (119 
      µmol/L vs. 103 µmol/L, P < 0.001), however, this association lost significance 
      following multivariate analysis. Seven patients (7%) in the HRS cohort received a 
      combined liver-kidney transplant. There was no significant difference in the 
      12-month post-transplant survival between the two groups (94% vs. 94%, P = 0.5). 
      CONCLUSION: Patients with HRS treated with terlipressin who subsequently undergo 
      liver transplantation have post-transplant renal and survival outcomes comparable 
      to patients transplanted for cirrhosis without HRS. This study supports the 
      practice of liver-only transplant in this cohort and the reservation of renal 
      allografts for those who have primary renal disease.

TI  - Chemoembolization combined radiofrequency ablation vs. chemoembolization alone

      (CERFA): study protocol for a randomized controlled trial.
PG  - 234
LID - 10.1186/s13063-023-07266-4 [doi]
LID - 234
AB  - BACKGROUND: Many previous studies evaluated a combination of transcatheter 
      arterial chemoembolization (TACE) and radiofrequency ablation (RFA) for treating 
      early hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC); however, studies evaluating combination 
      therapy for beyond-the-Milan criteria HCC are scarce. METHODS: A total of 120 
      patients with beyond-the-Milan criteria HCC who have viable tumour after first 
      TACE will be enrolled in this multi-institutional, parallel, pragmatic, 
      randomized controlled trial. Patients with metastasis, vascular invasion, or a 
      sum of tumour diameter > 8 cm will be excluded. Eligible patients will be 
      randomly assigned to combination TACE and RFA therapy or TACE monotherapy groups. 
      Patients in the combination therapy group will receive a second TACE and 
      subsequent RFA at the viable tumour. Patients in the TACE monotherapy group will 
      receive only second TACE. Patients in both groups will undergo magnetic resonance 
      imaging 4-6 weeks after second TACE. The primary endpoint is 1-month tumour 
      response, and secondary endpoints are progression-free survival, overall response 
      rate, number of treatments until CR, overall survival, and change in liver 
      function. DISCUSSION: Although TACE can be used to treat intermediate-stage HCC, 
      it is difficult to achieve CR by first TACE in most intermediate-stage patients. 
      Recent studies show a survival advantage of combination therapy over monotherapy. 
      However, most studies evaluating combination therapy included patients with a 
      single tumour sized < 5 cm, and no studies included patients with 
      intermediate-stage but more advanced (i.e., beyond-the-Milan criteria) HCC. This 
      study will evaluate the efficacy of combined TACE and RFA therapy for patients 
      with advanced HCC within the intermediate stage. TRIAL REGISTRATION: Clinical

TI  - Short-term efficacy assessment of transarterial chemoembolization combined with 
      radioactive iodine therapy in primary hepatocellular carcinoma.
PG  - 105-113
LID - 10.4240/wjgs.v15.i1.105 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) is an effective treatment for 
      primary hepatocellular carcinoma (PHC). Radioactive iodine therapy has been used 
      in the treatment of advanced PHC, especially in patients with portal vein tumor 
      thrombosis. However, data on the therapeutic effect of TACE combined with 
      radioactive iodine therapy in PHC are scarce. AIM: To investigate the clinical 
      efficacy of TACE combined with radioactive iodine implantation therapy in 
      advanced PHC via perfusion computed tomography (CT). METHODS: For this study, 98 
      advanced PHC patients were recruited and divided randomly into the study and 
      control groups. Patients in the study group were treated with TACE combined 
      radioactive iodine implantation therapy. Patients in the control group were 
      treated with only TACE. The tumor lesion length, clinical effect, serum 
      alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) and CT perfusion parameters were compared before and 
      after therapy, and statistical analysis was performed. RESULTS: There was no 
      significant difference in tumor length and serum AFP between the study and 
      control groups (P > 0.05) before treatment. However, the tumor length and serum 
      AFP in the study group were lower than those in the control group 1 mo and 3 mo 
      after therapy. After 3 mo of treatment, the complete and partial remission rate 
      of the study group was 93.88%, which was significantly higher than the control 
      group (77.55%) (P < 0.05). Before treatment, there were no significant 
      differences between the two groups on the perfusion CT variables, including the 
      lesion blood volume, permeability surface, blood flow, hepatic artery flow and 
      mean transit time (P > 0.05). After 3 mo of treatment, all perfusion CT variables 
      were lower in the study group compared to the control group (P < 0.05). The 
      survival time of patients in the study group was 22 mo compared to 18 mo in the 
      control group, which was significantly different [log rank (Mantel-Cox) = 4.318, 
      P = 0.038]. CONCLUSION: TACE combined with radioactive iodine implantation in the 
      treatment of advanced PHC can inhibit the formation of blood vessels in tumor 
      tissue and reduce the perfusion level of tumor lesions, thereby improving the 
      clinical efficacy and prolonging the survival time of patients.

LID - 10.1097/RCT.0000000000001448 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: This study aimed to explore the predictive performance of 
      diffusion-weighted imaging with apparent diffusion coefficient map in predicting 
      the proliferation rate of hepatocellular carcinoma and to develop a 
      radiomics-based nomogram. METHODS: This was a single-center retrospective study. 
      A total of 110 patients were enrolled. The sample included 38 patients with low 
      Ki67 expression (Ki67 ≤10%) and 72 with high Ki67 expression (Ki67 >10%) as 
      demonstrated by surgical pathology. Patients were randomly divided into either a 
      training (n = 77) or validation (n = 33) cohort. Diffusion-weighted imaging with 
      apparent diffusion coefficient maps was used to extract radiomic features and the 
      signal intensity values of tumor (SI tumor ), normal liver (SI liver ), and 
      background noise (SI background ) from all samples. Subsequently, the clinical 
      model, radiomic model, and fusion model (with clinical data and radiomic 
      signature) were developed and validated. RESULTS: The area under the curve (AUC) 
      of the clinical model for predicting the Ki67 expression including serum 
      α-fetoprotein level ( P = 0.010), age ( P = 0.015), and signal noise ratio ( P = 
      0.026) was 0.799 and 0.715 in training and validation cohorts, respectively. The 
      AUC of the radiomic model constructed by 9 selected radiomic features was 0.833 
      and 0.772 in training and validation cohorts, respectively. The AUC of the fusion 
      model containing serum α-fetoprotein level ( P = 0.011), age ( P = 0.019), and 
      rad score ( P < 0.001) was 0.901 and 0.781 in training and validation cohorts, 
      respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Diffusion-weighted imaging as a quantitative imaging 
      biomarker can predict Ki67 expression level in hepatocellular carcinoma across 
      various models.

AB  - BACKGROUND: We aimed to prospectively compare the diagnostic performance of 
      gadoxetic acid-enhanced MRI (EOB-MRI) and contrast-enhanced Computed Tomography 
      (CECT) for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) detection and liver transplant (LT) 
      eligibility assessment in cirrhotic patients with explant histopathology 
      correlation. METHODS: In this prospective, single-institution ethics-approved 
      study, 101 cirrhotic patients were enrolled consecutively from the pre-LT clinic 
      with written informed consent. Patients underwent CECT and EOB-MRI alternately 
      every 3 months until LT or study exclusion. Two blinded radiologists 
      independently scored hepatic lesions on CECT and EOB-MRI utilizing the liver 
      imaging reporting and data system (LI-RADS) version 2018. Liver explant 
      histopathology was the reference standard. Pre-LT eligibility accuracies with 
      EOB-MRI and CECT as per Milan criteria (MC) were assessed in reference to post-LT 
      explant histopathology. Lesion-level and patient-level statistical analyses were 
      performed. RESULTS: Sixty patients (49 men; age 33-72 years) underwent LT 
      successfully. One hundred four non-treated HCC and 42 viable HCC in previously 
      treated HCC were identified at explant histopathology. For LR-4/5 category 
      lesions, EOB-MRI had a higher pooled sensitivity (86.7% versus 75.3%, p <  0.001) 
      but lower specificity (84.6% versus 100%, p <  0.001) compared to CECT. EOB-MRI 
      had a sensitivity twice that of CECT (65.9% versus 32.2%, p <  0.001) when all 
      HCC identified at explant histopathology were included in the analysis instead of 
      imaging visible lesions only. Disregarding the hepatobiliary phase resulted in a 
      significant drop in EOB-MRI performance (86.7 to 72.8%, p <  0.001). EOB-MRI had 
      significantly lower pooled sensitivity and specificity versus CECT in the LR5 
      category with lesion size < 2 cm (50% versus 79%, p = 0.002 and 88.9% versus 
      100%, p = 0.002). EOB-MRI had higher sensitivity (84.8% versus 75%, p <  0.037) 
      compared to CECT for detecting < 2 cm viable HCC in treated lesions. Accuracies 
      of LT eligibility assessment were comparable between EOB-MRI (90-91.7%, 
      p = 0.156) and CECT (90-95%, p = 0.158). CONCLUSION: EOB-MRI had superior 
      sensitivity for HCC detection; however, with lower specificity compared to CECT 
      in LR4/5 category lesions while it was inferior to CECT in the LR5 category under 
      2 cm. The accuracy for LT eligibility assessment based on MC was not 
      significantly different between EOB-MRI and CECT. TRIAL REGISTRATION: 
      ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT03342677 , Registered: November 17, 2017.

TI  - Carbon ion radiotherapy with pencil beam scanning for hepatocellular carcinoma: 
      Long-term outcomes from a phase I trial.
PG  - 976-983
LID - 10.1111/cas.15633 [doi]
AB  - This study evaluates the feasibility of the pencil beam scanning technique of 
      carbon ion radiotherapy (CIRT) in the setting of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) 
      and establishes the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) calculated by the Local Effect 
      Model version I (LEM-I) with a dose escalation plan. The escalated relative 
      biological effectiveness-weighted dose levels included 55, 60, 65, and 70 Gy in 
      10 fractions. Active motion management techniques were employed, and several 
      measures were applied to mitigate the interplay effect induced by a moving 
      target. CIRT was planned with the LEM-I-based treatment planning system and 
      delivered by raster scanning. Offline PET/CT imaging was used to verify the beam 
      range. Offline adaptive replanning was performed whenever required. Twenty-three 
      patients with a median tumor size of 4.3 cm (range, 1.7-8.5 cm) were enrolled in 
      the present study. The median follow-up time was 56.1 months (range, 
      5.7-74.4 months). No dose limiting toxicity was observed until 70 Gy, and MTD had 
      not been reached. No patients experienced radiation-induced liver disease within 
      6 months after the completion of CIRT. The overall survival rates at 1, 3, and 
      5 years were 91.3%, 81.9%, and 67.1% after CIRT, respectively. The local 
      progression-free survival and progression-free survival rates at 1, 3 and 5 years 
      were 100%, 94.4%, and 94.4% and 73.6%, 59.2%, and 37.0%, respectively. The raster 
      scanning technique could be used to treat HCC. However, caution should be 
      exercised to mitigate the interplay effect. CIRT up to 70 Gy in 10 fractions over 
      2 weeks was safe and effective for HCC.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: We evaluated the postoperative radiotherapy (PORT) 
      effects on hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) prognosis and recurrence in patients 
      who underwent narrow-margin (<1.0 cm) hepatectomy (NH). MATERIALS AND METHODS: 
      This two-arm cohort study based on the phase II study compared NH with or without 
      PORT in patients with HCC. All patients underwent NH; 76 patients who received 
      PORT following NH in the phase II study were assigned to the NH + RT group, and 
      171 who underwent NH alone were assigned to the NH group. Propensity score 
      matching (PSM) was used to balance clinicopathological characteristic differences 
      between groups. RESULTS: Before PSM, the 5-year overall survival (OS) rates 
      between groups differed significantly (72.2 % vs 60.7 %, P = 0.017). Moreover, 
      the 5-year disease-free survival (DFS) rate was significantly higher in the 
      NH + RT group (51.4 % vs 35.7 %, P = 0.002). After PSM, the between-group 
      difference in OS rates remained high (P = 0.045); the 5-year OS rates were 74.7 % 
      and 63.6 % in the NH + RT and NH groups, respectively. Similarly, the DFS rate 
      remained significantly higher in the NH + RT group (P = 0.001); the 5-year DFS 
      rates were 56.3 % and 31.6 %, respectively. Furthermore, both before and after 
      PSM, patients in the NH + RT group showed significantly lower early, 
      intrahepatic, and extrahepatic recurrence rates than those in the NH group. 
      CONCLUSIONS: PORT may have significant OS and DFS benefits in patients with HCC 
      undergoing NH.

TI  - 3D-CEUS/MRI-CEUS fusion imaging vs 2D-CEUS after locoregional therapies for 
      hepatocellular carcinoma: a multicenter prospective study of therapeutic 
      response evaluation.
PG  - 453-462
LID - 10.1007/s00330-024-10915-0 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To compare the diagnostic accuracy of 3D contrast-enhanced ultrasound 
      (CEUS)/MRI-CEUS fusion imaging with 2D-CEUS in assessing the response of 
      hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) to locoregional therapies in a multicenter 
      prospective study. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A consecutive series of patients with 
      HCC scheduled for locoregional treatment were enrolled between April 2021 and 
      March 2023. Patients were randomly divided into 3D-CEUS/MRI-CEUS fusion imaging 
      group (3D/fusion group) or 2D-CEUS group (2D group). CEUS was performed 1 week 
      before and 4-6 weeks after locoregional treatment. Contrast-enhanced MRI (CE-MRI) 
      4-6 weeks after treatment was set as the reference standard. CEUS images were 
      evaluated for the presence or absence of viable tumors. Diagnostic performance 
      criteria, including sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, and area under the curve 
      (AUC), were determined for each modality. RESULTS: A total of 140 patients were 
      included, 70 patients in the 2D group (mean age, 60.2 ± 10.4 years) and 70 
      patients in the 3D/fusion group (mean age, 59.8 ± 10.6 years). The sensitivity of 
      the 3D/fusion group was 100.0% (95% CI: 75.9, 100.0), higher than that of the 2D 
      group (55.6%, 95% CI: 22.7, 84.7; p = 0.019). The specificity of the 3D/fusion 
      group was 96.3% (95% CI: 86.2, 99.4), which was comparable to that of the 2D 
      group (98.4%, 95% CI: 90.0, 99.9; p = 0.915). The AUC of the 3D/fusion group was 
      0.98 (95% CI: 0.95, 1.00), higher than that of the 2D group (0.77, 95% CI: 0.56, 
      0.98; p = 0.020). CONCLUSION: 3D-CEUS/MRI-CEUS fusion imaging exhibits superior 
      diagnostic accuracy in evaluating the treatment response to locoregional 
      therapies for HCC. CLINICAL RELEVANCE STATEMENT: 3D-CEUS/MRI-CEUS fusion imaging 
      can be applied for post-treatment assessment of residual tumors in HCC undergoing 
      locoregional treatment, offering potential benefits in terms of accurate 
      diagnosis and clinical management. KEY POINTS: Evaluating for HCC recurrence 
      following locoregional therapy is important. 3D-CEUS/MRI-CEUS fusion imaging 
      achieved a higher sensitivity than 2D-CEUS in assessing residual tumors after 
      locoregional therapies. 3D-CEUS/MRI-CEUS fusion imaging can help clinicians 
      intervene early in residual HCC lesions after locoregional treatment.

TI  - Proposed carbohydrate antigen 19-9 (CA19-9) cut-off values for the detection of 
      pancreatic cancer in patients with poorly controlled diabetes: a real-world 
      study.
PG  - 1069-1075
LID - 10.1507/endocrj.EJ23-0186 [doi]
AB  - CA19-9 is a tumor marker for pancreatic cancer (PC), and the nondiabetic cut-off 
      level is 37 U/mL. CA19-9 levels are said to rise in patients with tumors like PC 
      and intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm (IPMN). CA19-9 levels have also been 
      shown to be related to HbA1c levels. We hypothesized that the CA19-9 cut-off 
      levels would differ between patients with poorly controlled diabetes. This 
      real-world trial was designed to test our hypotheses. This was a retrospective 
      cohort study. All inpatients with poorly controlled diabetes had mean HbA1c 
      levels of 10.0% and were divided into three groups: those with pancreatic cancer 
      (PC group, N = 20), those with IPMN (IPMN group, N = 55), and those with neither 
      (NC group, N = 985). Serum CA19-9 levels in the PC group were significantly 
      higher than in the IPMN and NC groups (p < 0.001). CA19-9 levels did not differ 
      statistically between the IPMN and NC groups. According to the receiver operating 
      characteristic (ROC) analysis, serum CA19-9 levels of 98.4 U/mL had the highest 
      sensitivity and specificity to detect PC, when comparing PC to IPMN + NC groups. 
      Using this cut-off, the sensitivity and specificity of CA19-9 for PC were 70.0% 
      and 96.5%, respectively, with a 0.81 area under the ROC curve. CA19-9 levels in 
      two inpatients were >98.4 U/mL, most likely due to hepatocellular carcinoma and 
      esophageal cancer. CA19-9 cut-off levels were thought to be 98.4 U/mL. However, 
      we should keep in mind that the sensitivity and specificity were not 100%.

TI  - Experience with direct-acting antivirals in genotype 1-5 infected chronic 
      hepatitis C patients in Turkey.
PG  - 308-314

AB  - BACKGROUND: Hepatitis C virus (HCV) can cause chronic liver disease, hepatic 
      cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma, liver transplantation, and death. Early 
      diagnosis and treatment are thus vital. OBJECTIVES: We aimed to investigate the 
      sustained virological response (SVR) rates in chronic hepatitis C patients 
      infected with different genotypes, receiving different direct-acting antiviral 
      treatments (DAAs). DESIGN: Retrospective, observational SETTING: Clinic for 
      infectious diseases and clinical microbiology PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients 
      diagnosed with chronic hepatitis C who applied to our outpatient clinic between 
      January 2016 and November 2022 and were treated with a DAA were included in the 
      study. Treatment responses were evaluated after each patient was treated with 
      either ledipasvir plus sofosbuvir (LDV/SOF), LDV/SOF + ribavirin (RBV), SOF+RBV, 
      ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir plus dasabuvir (OBV/PTV/r±DSV) ±RBV, or 
      glecaprevir plus pibrentasvir (GLE/PIB). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Sustained 
      virological response (SVR) rates at 12 weeks (SVR12) post-treatment. SAMPLE SIZE: 
      360 patients. RESULTS: Of 360 patients who met the inclusion criteria, 218 
      (60.6%) were male and 142 (39.4%) were female with no statistically significant 
      differences in SVR between sexes (P=.252). Nearly all had a SVR (n=353, 98.1%). 
      The median (IQR) age of the patients was 56 (30.3) years. There were 42 (11.7%), 
      199 (55.3%), 4 (1.1%), 106 (29.4%), 8 (2.2%) and 1 (0.3%) patient with genotypes 
      1a, 1b, 2, 3, 4 and 5, respectively, and SVR12 did not differ significantly 
      between genotypes (P=.066). SVR12 response was higher in 246 (68.3%) 
      non-injecting drug users compared to 114 (31.7%) injecting drug users (P=.005). 
      The SVR12 response was achieved in 100% of patients with genotypes 1a, 2, 4, and 
      5. SVR12 response could not be obtained in 1 of 199 genotype 1b patients and 6 of 
      106 genotype 3 patients. The common feature of 6 reinfection patients with 
      genotype 3 was that they were using intravenous drugs. These 6 patients were 
      reinfected due to their continued intravenous drug use. CONCLUSION: In 
      conclusion, DAAs provide high SVR12 rates in cirrhotic/non-cirrhotic, pegylated 
      interferon-naive/experienced patient groups and in patients infected with all 
      genotypes. DAAs have a high SVR12 rate in patients with chronic hepatitis C. 
      LIMITATIONS: Retrospective, single-center.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Liver transplantation (LT) is the best treatment for patients with 
      hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). However, the surgical technique needs to be 
      improved. The present study aimed to evaluate the "no-touch" technique in LT. 
      METHODS: From January 2018 to December 2019, we performed a prospective 
      randomized controlled trial on HCC patients who underwent LT. The patients were 
      randomized into two groups: a no-touch technique LT group (NT group, n = 38) and 
      a conventional LT technique group (CT group, n = 46). Operative outcomes and 
      survival in the two groups were analyzed. RESULTS: The perioperative parameters 
      were comparable between the two groups (P > 0.05). There was no significant 
      difference between the two groups in disease-free survival (DFS) (P = 0.732) or 
      overall survival (OS) (P = 0.891). Of 36 patients who were beyond the Hangzhou 
      criteria for LT, the DFS of the patients in the NT group was significantly longer 
      than that in the CT group (median 402 vs. 126 days, P = 0.025). In 31 patients 
      who had portal vein tumor thrombosis (PVTT), DFS and OS in the NT group were 
      significantly better than those in the CT group (median DFS 420 vs. 167 days, 
      P = 0.022; 2-year OS rate 93.8% vs. 66.7%, P = 0.043). In 14 patients who had 
      diffuse-type HCCs, DFS and OS were significantly better in the NT group than 
      those in the CT group (median DFS 141 vs. 56 days, P = 0.008; 2-year OS rate 
      75.0% vs. 33.3%, P = 0.034). Multivariate analysis showed that for patients with 
      PVTT and diffuse-type HCCs, the no-touch technique was an independent favorable 
      factor for OS (PVTT: HR = 0.018, 95% CI: 0.001-0.408, P = 0.012; diffuse-type 
      HCCs: HR = 0.034, 95% CI: 0.002-0.634, P = 0.024). CONCLUSIONS: The no-touch 
      technique improved the survival of patients with advanced HCC compared with the 
      conventional technique. The no-touch technique may provide a new and effective LT 
      technique for advanced HCCs.

TI  - Clinical characteristics and management of patients with nonalcoholic 
      steatohepatitis in a real-world setting: analysis of the Ipsos NASH therapy 
      monitor database.
PG  - 160

AB  - BACKGROUND: Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is the more severe, inflammatory 
      type of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). NASH, a leading indication for 
      liver transplantation, is growing in prevalence. The extent of liver fibrosis, 
      ranging from fibrosis stage (FS) of none (F0) to cirrhosis (F4), is a strong 
      predictor of health outcomes. There is little information on patient demographics 
      and clinical characteristics by fibrosis stage and NASH treatment outside of 
      academic medical centers. METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional observational 
      study using Ipsos' syndicated NASH Therapy Monitor database, consisting of 
      medical chart audits provided by sampled NASH-treating physicians in the United 
      States in 2016 (n = 174) and 2017 (n = 164). Data was collected online. RESULTS: 
      Of 2,366 patients reported on by participating physicians and included in the 
      analysis, 68% had FS F0-F2, 21% had bridging fibrosis (F3), and 9% had cirrhosis 
      (F4). Common comorbidities were type 2 diabetes (56%), hyperlipidemia (44%), 
      hypertension (46%), and obesity (42%). Patients with more advanced fibrosis 
      scores (F3-F4) had higher comorbidity rates than patients with F0-F2. Commonly 
      used diagnostic tests included ultrasound (80%), liver biopsy (78%), AST/ALT 
      ratio (43%), NAFLD fibrosis score (25%), transient elastography (23%), NAFLD 
      liver fat score (22%), and Fatty Liver Index (19%). Most commonly prescribed 
      medications were vitamin E (53%), statins (51%), metformin (47%), angiotensin 
      converting enzyme inhibitors (28%), and beta blockers (22%). Medications were 
      commonly prescribed for reasons other than their known effects. CONCLUSION: 
      Physicians in this study, drawn from a spectrum of practice settings, relied on 
      ultrasound and liver biopsy for diagnosis and vitamin E, statins, and metformin 
      for pharmacological treatment of NASH. These findings imply poor adherence to 
      guidelines in the diagnosis and management of NAFLD and NASH. Nonalcoholic 
      steatohepatitis (NASH) is a liver disease caused by excess fat in the liver which 
      can lead to liver inflammation and scarring (fibrosis), ranging from stage F0 (no 
      scarring) to F4 (advanced scarring). The stage of liver scarring can predict the 
      likelihood of future health problems, including liver failure and liver cancer. 
      However, we do not fully understand how patient characteristics may vary at 
      different stages of liver scarring. We looked at medical information from 
      physicians treating patients diagnosed with NASH to understand how patient 
      characteristics might differ based on the severity of their liver scarring. The 
      majority (68%) of patients were stage F0-F2, with 30% having advanced scarring 
      (F3-F4). In addition to NASH, many patients also had type 2 diabetes, high 
      cholesterol, high blood pressure, and obesity. Patients with more advanced 
      scarring (F3-F4) were more likely to have these diseases than patients with less 
      severe disease (F0-F2). Diagnosis of NASH by participating physicians was based 
      on tests including imaging (ultrasound, CT scan, MRI), liver biopsy, blood tests, 
      and whether patients had other conditions that would put them at risk for NASH. 
      The medications that the doctors prescribed most often to their patients included 
      vitamin E and drugs to treat high cholesterol, high blood pressure, or diabetes. 
      Medications were frequently prescribed for reasons other than their known 
      effects. By understanding how patient characteristics vary by stages of liver 
      scarring and how NASH is currently managed may help guide the evaluation and 
      treatment of NASH when NASH-specific therapies become available.

TI  - Intermittent Pringle maneuver combined with controlled low Central venous 
      pressure prolongs hepatic hilum occlusion time in patients with hepatocellular 
      carcinoma complicated by post hepatitis B cirrhosis: a randomized controlled 
      trial.
PG  - 497-504
LID - 10.1080/00365521.2022.2147802 [doi]
AB  - Background: The optimal occlusion and reperfusion time to balance blood loss and 
      ischemia-reperfusion injury to the remnant liver remains unclear. The aim was to 
      explore the clinical impact of prolonging the hepatic hilum occlusion time from 
      15 to 20 min using the intermittent Pringle maneuver (IPM) combined with 
      controlled low central venous pressure (CLCVP).Methods: A total of 151 patients 
      were included and divided into an experimental group (Group 20,75 cases) and a 
      control group (Group 15,76 cases). In both groups, the hepatic hilum was blocked 
      by the IPM combined with CLCVP to control intraoperative hepatic cross-sectional 
      bleeding. The preoperative, intraoperative and postoperative parameters and 
      safety were compared between the two groups.Results: There were no significant 
      differences between the two groups in the postoperative aminotransferase serum 
      levels (p > 0.05). However, the operation time in Group 20 was significantly 
      lower than that in Group 15 (222.4 ± 87.8 vs. 250.7 ± 94.5 min, p < 0.05). The 
      procalcitonin at 1 day after operation in Group 20 was lower than that at 1 day 
      after operation in Group 15 (0.78 ± 0.66 vs. 1.45 ± 1.33 ng/mL, p < 0.05). There 
      was no significant difference in the incidence of postoperative bleeding, 
      postoperative bile leakage and postoperative infection between the two groups 
      (p > 0.05).Conclusions: For patients with hepatocellular carcinoma after 
      hepatitis B cirrhosis, it is feasible and safe to prolong the hepatic hilum 
      occlusion time from 15 to 20 min using the IPM combined with CLCVP.

TI  - Enlargement of the Spleen Index Is a Predictor of the Occurrence of Esophageal

PG  - 2597-2606

AB  - Objective Direct-acting antiviral agents (DAAs) can eliminate hepatitis C virus 
      at a high rate, although the long-term incidence of portal hypertension and 
      hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) has not yet been elucidated. In this observational 
      study, we clarified the predictors associated with the incidence of esophageal 
      varices (EVs) and HCC after DAAs treatment based on ultrasound findings and blood 
      examinations. Methods A total of 78 patients treated with DAAs were enrolled in 
      this study. The primary endpoint was to identify the predictors associated with 
      EVs and HCC occurrence using univariate and multivariate analyses. Secondary 
      endpoints were to extract the cutoff values for EVs and HCC occurrence and 
      clarify the changes in liver stiffness (LS), spleen stiffness (SS), spleen index 
      (SI), portal venous flow volume (PVF), and blood examination at 12 weeks after 
      the end of DAAs treatment. Results The mean observation period was 1,402±546 
      days. SI change (SI after DAAs-SI before DAAs) was a predictor of EVs occurrence 
      in multivariate analysis (p=0.045). The treatment history of HCC, albumin value 
      before DAAs, and SI change were predictors of HCC occurrence in multivariate 
      analysis (p=0.002, p=0.032, and p=0.009, respectively). LS, SS, PVF, SI, and 
      liver function significantly improved after DAAs treatment. Conclusion Portal 
      hypertension seems to improve after DAAs treatment over a long period. Patients 
      with splenomegaly deterioration after DAAs treatment need to be carefully 
      monitored for the occurrence of EVs and HCC.

TI  - IOP Injection, A Novel Superparamagnetic Iron Oxide Particle MRI Contrast Agent 
      for the Detection of Hepatocellular Carcinoma: A Phase II Clinical Trial.
PG  - 1177-1188
LID - 10.1002/jmri.28645 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: MRI is crucial in diagnosing hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). 
      Superparamagnetic iron oxide particles (SPIO) are liver-specific contrast agents 
      which enhance lesions in T(2) -weighted images. Iron oxide nano-particle 
      m-PEG-silane (IOP) Injection, a newly developed SPIO, showed promising imaging 
      effects and good safety profile in preclinical studies and in phase I clinical 
      trial. PURPOSE: To evaluate the safety and clinical validity of IOP Injection as 
      MRI contrast agent in diagnosing HCC. STUDY TYPE: Prospective. SUBJECTS: A total 
      of 52 subjects (61.6 ± 11.05 years, 45 males/7 females) with suspected HCC. FIELD 
      STRENGTH/SEQUENCE: 1.5 T, T(1) -weighted in/opposed phase, T(2) *-weighted 
      gradient echo, T(2) -weighted fast spin echo, true fast imaging with steady-state 
      free precession. ASSESSMENT: Adverse effects and clinical monitoring were 
      recorded throughout the 5-day study. Two independent readers (M.G.H. with 
      30 years of experience, S.P.K. with 26 years of experience) made the diagnosis. 
      The diagnostic performance of IOP-enhanced MRI was evaluated with sensitivity and 
      positive predictive value by comparing to the pathology reports from subsequent 
      hepatic resection. The number of lesions with various sizes and degrees of 
      differentiation detected by IOP-enhanced MRI was assessed. The relative change in 
      signal intensities over time was indirectly measured from acquired images. 
      STATISTICAL TESTS: Sensitivity and positive predictive value were used to 
      evaluate the diagnostic performance of IOP-enhanced MRI. Prevalence-adjusted and 
      bias-adjusted 𝜅 coefficient was used to assess the interreader variability. 
      RESULTS: No serious adverse event related to IOP Injection was found. IOP 
      Injection enhanced the lesion-to-liver contrast ratio in T(2) *-weighted images 
      by 50.1% ± 4.8%. IOP-enhanced MRI detected HCC with 100% sensitivity by subject 
      and 96% sensitivity by lesion. IOP Injection visualized subtle vascular invasion 
      as filling defect within vessels in true fast imaging with steady-state free 
      precession (TrueFISP) images. DATA CONCLUSION: IOP Injection was safe and 
      efficacious as MRI contrast agent in diagnosing HCC in a limited group of 
      subjects. EVIDENCE LEVEL: 2. TECHNICAL EFFICACY: Stage 2.

TI  - Efficacy of Invariant Natural Killer T Cell Infusion Plus Transarterial 
      Embolization vs Transarterial Embolization Alone for Hepatocellular Carcinoma 
      Patients: A Phase 2 Randomized Clinical Trial.
PG  - 1379-1388
LID - 10.2147/JHC.S416933 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Invariant NKT cells (iNKT) are CD1d-restricted T cells with the capacity 
      of antitumor immunity. The safety of autologous iNKT cell treatment in 
      hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) has been verified. This study aimed to investigate 
      its efficacy in advanced HCC after transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) 
      failure. PATIENTS AND METHODS: This open-label, randomized, controlled, trial 
      enrolled 60 patients with unresectable HCC after TACE failure at three centers. 
      Transarterial embolization (TAE) was used instead of TACE to protect iNKT cell 
      function. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive TAE therapy with 
      (TAE-iNKT) or without (TAE) biweekly iNKT cell infusion. The primary endpoint was 
      progression-free survival (PFS). Secondary endpoints included overall survival 
      (OS), objective response rate (ORR), disease control rate (DCR), quality of life 
      (QoL), peripheral blood cell count, and safety. RESULTS: Fifty-four patients 
      completed the study. Median PFS was significantly higher in TAE-iNKT patients 
      (5.7 months [95% CI, 4.3-7.0 months]) compared with TAE patients (2.7 months [95% 
      CI, 2.3-3.2 months]; hazard ratio 0.32 [95% CI, 0.16-0.63]; P<0.001). Higher ORR 
      and DCR were observed in TAE-iNKT patients (52% and 85%, respectively) compared 
      with TAE patients (11% and 33%; respectively). Five TAE-iNKT patients and 1 TAE 
      patient achieved completed response. The median time to deterioration in QoL was 
      longer in TAE-iNKT patients (9.2 months [95% CI, 6.0-13.3 months]) compared with 
      TAE patients (3.0 months [95% CI, 2.9-3.0 months]). The mean lymphocytes were 
      higher in the TAE-iNKT group than in the TAE group at 8 (1.48 vs 0.95×10(9)/L, P 
      = 0.007) and 12 (1.49 vs 0.89×10(9)/L, P = 0.001) weeks. Grade 3 adverse events 
      occurred in 1 TAE-iNKT patient (4%) and 5 TAE patients (19%). All the other 
      adverse events were grade 1-2. CONCLUSION: iNKT cell infusion significantly 
      improved PFS, ORR, DCR, and QoL with manageable toxicity during TAE therapy in 
      patients with HCC. Trial Registration ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT04011033.

TI  - Sustained virological response to antiviral drugs in treatment of different 
      genotypes of HCV cirrhotic patients.
PG  - 1009-1015
AB  - Cirrhosis and liver cancer are both caused by hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection 
      of the liver. Patients with HCV cirrhosis may be treated with one of many 
      antiviral medications, depending on their specific genotype. Samples of cirrhotic 
      HCV were obtained from 190 people at the Khyber Teaching Hospital and the 
      Hayatabad Medical Complex in Peshawar, Pakistan. Multiplex and real-time PCR were 
      used to assess the genotypes and viral loads of the samples, respectively. Sixty 
      patients were given sofosbuvir plus daclatasvir with ribavirin, while the 
      remaining 56 patients were given sofosbuvir with ribavirin for a period of 12-24 
      weeks. LFTs were also tracked both before and after therapy. Group I (sofosbuvir 
      + daclatasvir) had a sustained virological response of 82.70 percent. Group II 
      (sofosbuvir + daclatasvir with ribavirin) had an 86% sustained virological 
      response, whereas group III (84% sustained virological response) received only 
      ribavirin. When compared to other genotypes, genotype 3 showed the most 
      impressive sustained virologic response (SVR) to the antiviral medicines. Based 
      on the results of this trial, we propose sofosbuvir + daclatasvir ribavirin for 
      the treatment of cirrhotic patients with various HCV genotypes since it produces 
      the greatest sustained virological response.

TI  - Construction of a novel disulfidptosis-related signature for improving outcomes 
      in hepatocellular carcinoma: Observational study.
PG  - e35423

LID - e35423
AB  - Disulfidptosis is a novel form of metabolic-related regulated cell death (RCD) 
      that is caused by disulfide stress caused by the accumulation of excess cystine 
      in the cell. Targeting disulfide metabolism imbalance is an emerging strategy for 
      the treatment of cancer. However, it is undetermined how disulfidptosis-related 
      genes (DRGs) influence hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Unsupervised clustering 
      analysis was performed on the TCGA-LIHC cohort to identify various phenotypes of 
      disulfidptosis. GSVA was used to measure the activation of characteristic gene 
      sets, while CIBERSORT was employed to estimate the infiltration of immune cells. 
      Disulfidptosis-related signature was generated to quantify the phenotype of 
      disulfidptosis in HCC patients. Next, we examined the disparities among the high 
      and low disulfidptosis score categories by considering clinical characteristics, 
      infiltration of immune cells, functions related to the immune system, sensitivity 
      to chemotherapeutic drugs, and effectiveness of immunotherapy. Two different 
      disulfidptosis phenotypes with different prognoses, clinical traits, biological 
      pathways, and immune cell infiltration were identified. Based on differently 
      expressed genes (DEGs) among 2 disulfidptosis phenotypes, a 
      disulfidptosis-related signature was built. The prognostic value of this 
      signature was then evaluated in the TCGA and GEO datasets. Low disulfidptosis 
      score indicated favorable clinical outcomes, higher levels of immune cell 
      infiltration, lower tumor purity, and enhanced immune responses. Furthermore, we 
      noticed a clear disparity in tumor mutation load and drug responsiveness when 
      comparing the high and low disulfidptosis score categories. Finally, a 
      quantitative nomogram was built with disulfidptosis score and several clinical 
      characteristics. The disulfidptosis-related signature provides new insights into 
      the tumor immune microenvironment and complexity in HCC. The disulfidptosis score 
      can serve as a promising tool for personalized prognostic prediction of HCC 
      patients and for customizing more effective immunotherapeutic strategies.

AB  - Portal vein thrombosis (PVT) is a common thrombotic complication of cirrhosis. It 
      can lead to variceal bleeding and bowel ischemia and also complicate liver 
      transplantation. Identifying the possible risk factors associated with PVT can 
      aid in identifying patients at high risk, enabling their screening and 
      potentially preventing PVT through the rational use of anticoagulants. This study 
      focuses on examining the clinical characteristics of PVT in cirrhotic patients 
      and identifying the clinical and biochemical factors that are linked to the 
      development of PVT. Consecutive hospitalized cirrhotic patients between 2015 and 
      2023 were identified through the hospital's computerized medical records based on 
      the Tenth Revision of the International Statistical Classification of Diseases 
      and Related Health Problems (ICD-10) coding system and retrospectively analyzed. 
      928 individuals were included in this study; 783 (84.3%) without PVT and 145 
      (15.7%) with benign PVT. Hepatitis B virus (HBV) was significantly more common in 
      the PVT group (P-value = .02), while alcohol and primary sclerosing cholangitis 
      (PSC) were less common in this group (P-value = .01 and .02, respectively). 
      Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) (P-value < .01), ascites (P-value = .01), and 
      spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) (P-value = .02) were more common in the 
      PVT group. Patients with PVT had a higher international normalized ratio (INR) 
      level (P-value = .042) and lower plasma albumin (P-value = .01). No differences 
      were identified in white blood cell, hemoglobin, platelet, and bilirubin levels. 
      However, patients with PVT had higher model for end-stage liver disease (MELD) 
      (P-value = .01) and Child-Pugh scores (P-value = .03). This study demonstrated a 
      higher likelihood of PVT presence in cirrhotic patients with advanced age, HBV, 
      and HCC, along with ascites, SBP, splenomegaly, hypoalbuminemia, elevated INR, 
      and a higher MELD score. Nevertheless, additional research endeavors are 
      necessary to accurately ascertain and validate supplementary risk factors within 
      a broader demographic.

TI  - Effect of a High-Fat Meal on Single-Dose Rencofilstat (CRV431) Oral 
      Bioavailability in Healthy Human Subjects.
PG  - 287-293
LID - 10.1002/cpdd.1179 [doi]
AB  - Rencofilstat (RCF) is a novel cyclophilin inhibitor under development for the 
      treatment of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis and hepatocellular carcinoma. This 
      phase 1, randomized, open-label study in healthy participants assessed the 
      relative bioavailability of a single dose of RCF 225-mg soft gelatin capsules in 
      both fasted and high-fat conditions. Forty-four participants were enrolled to 
      either the fasted (n = 24) or the high-fat fed (n = 20) arm. Noncompartmental 
      pharmacokinetics were evaluated following a single 225-mg oral dose. 
      Administration of RCF with a high-fat meal led to increases in maximum 
      concentration, area under the concentration-time curve (AUC) from time 0 to 
      24 hours, and AUC from time 0 to infinity fed-to-fasted geometric mean ratios of 
      102.2%, 114.5%, and 132.9%, respectively. All AUC geometric mean ratios were 
      outside of the 80% to 125% range, suggesting that a high-fat meal can increase 
      the extent of RCF exposure. Time to maximum concentration increased from 1.5 to 
      1.8 hours in the fasted and high-fat groups, respectively, suggesting slightly 
      delayed absorption. High fat intake may delay gastric emptying while increasing 
      the absorption and bioavailability of RCF. No treatment-emergent adverse events 
      were observed in the fasted group, and 1 treatment-emergent adverse event 
      occurred in the high-fat meal group. The differences in observed whole-blood 
      concentrations are unlikely to have clinically relevant effects given the wide 
      therapeutic index of RCF demonstrated in previous phase 1 studies.

TI  - Effect of aerobic exercise training on the fat fraction of the liver in persons 
      with chronic hepatitis B and hepatic steatosis: Trial protocol for a randomized 
      controlled intervention trial- The FitLiver study.
PG  - 398
LID - 10.1186/s13063-023-07385-y [doi]
LID - 398
AB  - BACKGROUND: The global prevalence of chronic hepatitis B is more than 300 million 
      people, and in Denmark, 17,000 people are estimated to have chronic hepatitis B. 
      Untreated, chronic hepatitis B can lead to the development of liver cirrhosis and 
      liver cancer. There is no curable therapy. In persons with obesity and chronic 
      hepatitis B infection, the development of hepatic steatosis imposes a double 
      burden on the liver, leading to an increased risk of cirrhosis and liver cancer. 
      In patients without chronic hepatitis B, exercise interventions have shown 
      beneficial effects on hepatic steatosis through improvements in fat fraction of 
      the liver, insulin resistance, fatty acid metabolism, and glucose metabolism, as 
      well as activation of liver-induced regulatory protein secretion (hepatokines) 
      after the exercise intervention. OBJECTIVE: To investigate in persons with 
      chronic hepatitis B and hepatic steatosis: Primary: Whether exercise will 
      decrease the fat fraction of the liver. Secondary: If exercise will affect 
      hepatokine secretion and if it will improve lipid- and glucose metabolism, liver 
      status, markers of inflammation, body composition, and blood pressure. METHODS: A 
      randomized, controlled, clinical intervention trial consisting of 12 weeks of 
      aerobic exercise training or no intervention. Thirty persons with chronic 
      hepatitis B and hepatic steatosis will be randomized 1:1. Before and after the 
      intervention, participants will undergo an MRI scan of the liver, blood sampling, 
      oral glucose tolerance test, fibroscan, VO2(max) test, DXA scan, blood pressure 
      measurements, and optional liver biopsy. Lastly, a hormone infusion test with 
      somatostatin and glucagon to increase the glucagon/insulin ratio for stimulating 
      secretion of circulating hepatokines will be performed. The training program 
      includes three weekly training sessions of 40 min/session over 12 weeks. 
      DISCUSSION: This trial, investigating high-intensity interval training in persons 
      with chronic hepatitis B and hepatic steatosis, is the first exercise 
      intervention trial performed on this group of patients. If exercise reduces 
      hepatic steatosis and induces other beneficial effects of clinical markers in 
      this group of patients, there might be an indication to recommend exercise as 
      part of treatment. Furthermore, the investigation of the effect of exercise on 
      hepatokine secretion will provide more knowledge on the effects of exercise on 
      the liver. TRIAL REGISTRATION: Danish Capital Regions committee on health

TI  - A Phase 1a/1b Dose Escalation/Expansion Study of the Anti-PD-1 Monoclonal 
      Antibody Nofazinlimab in Chinese Patients with Solid Tumors or Lymphoma.
PG  - 723-733
LID - 10.1007/s11523-024-01091-8 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Immune checkpoint blockade with anti-programmed cell death 1 (PD-1) 
      antibodies has demonstrated efficacy in multiple tumor types. Nofazinlimab is a 
      humanized rat antibody targeting PD-1. A first-in-human study of nofazinlimab 
      conducted in Australia found no dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) and the maximum 
      tolerated dose (MTD) was not reached in the range of 1-10 mg/kg. OBJECTIVE: We 
      evaluated nofazinlimab for multiple advanced malignancies in Chinese patients. 
      PATIENTS AND METHODS: This was a phase 1a/1b, open-label, multicenter, 
      dose-escalation/expansion trial. In phase 1a, patients received an abbreviated 
      dose escalation of nofazinlimab at 60 mg and 200 mg every 3 weeks (Q3W) to 
      determine DLTs and the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D). In phase 1b, patients 
      received the RP2D (monotherapy/combination) in six arms by tumor type; DLTs were 
      evaluated for nofazinlimab plus lenvatinib in the unresectable hepatocellular 
      carcinoma (uHCC) arm. Safety (continuously monitored in patients who received 
      nofazinlimab) and efficacy (patients with measurable baseline disease) were 
      assessed. RESULTS: Overall, 107 patients were eligible and received nofazinlimab. 
      In phase 1a, no DLTs were observed; the RP2D was 200mg Q3W. In phase 1b, no DLTs 
      were observed with nofazinlimab plus lenvatinib. The safety profile was 
      consistent with that observed in the first-in-human study (NCT03475251). In phase 
      1b, 21/88 (23.9%) patients achieved confirmed objective responses, 26 (29.5%) had 
      stable disease, and 9/20 (45.0%) patients with uHCC achieved confirmed objective 
      responses to nofazinlimab plus lenvatinib. CONCLUSIONS: Nofazinlimab was well 
      tolerated in Chinese patients. Preliminary efficacy was encouraging, particularly 
      for nofazinlimab plus lenvatinib in uHCC, which is being studied in an ongoing 
      phase 3 trial. CLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRATION: NCT03809767; registered 18 January

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Management of elderly patients with cancer has become a global 
      issue. We investigated the safety and tolerability of lenvatinib in 
      hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients ≥80 years old. METHODS: We 
      retrospectively evaluated 61 HCC patients and divided them into 2 groups: an 
      elderly group (n = 13, ≥80 years old) and a younger group (n = 48, <80 years 
      old). We compared the adverse events (AEs), administration period, dose 
      intensity, objective response, and progression-free survival (PFS) between the 
      two groups. RESULTS: The discontinuation of lenvatinib due to AEs was more 
      frequent in the elderly group (8/13, 61.5%) than in the younger group (10/48, 
      20.8%) (P = 0.0043). Fatigue and appetite loss accounted for half of the cases 
      discontinued due to AEs in the elderly group. The elderly group had a 
      significantly lower 8-week-delivered dose intensity/body surface area ratio 
      (147.2) and 8-week-relative dose intensity (50.0%) than those in the younger 
      group (267.4, 67%) (P = 0.003, 0.029). The objective response rate was 
      significantly lower in the elderly group (15.4%) than in the younger group 
      (61.5%) (P = 0.021). The PFS in the elderly group tended to be shorter than that 
      in the younger group (P = 0.058, hazard ratio [HR] 1.98). The modified 
      albumin-bilirubin (mALBI) grade (hepatic function) (HR, 2.60; P = 0.01) and 
      objective response (HR, 0.41; P = 0.011) were independently associated with the 
      PFS in the multivariate analysis. CONCLUSION: The management of AEs is crucial 
      for adherence and maintaining the dose intensity of lenvatinib in elderly HCC 
      patients.

TI  - Managing Postembolization Syndrome Through a Machine Learning-Based Clinical 
      Decision Support System: A Randomized Controlled Trial.

AB  - Although transarterial chemoembolization has improved as an interventional method 
      for hepatocellular carcinoma, subsequent postembolization syndrome is a threat to 
      the patients' quality of life. This study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of 
      a clinical decision support system in postembolization syndrome management across 
      nurses and patient outcomes. This study is a randomized controlled trial. We 
      included 40 RNs and 51 hospitalized patients in the study. For nurses in the 
      experimental group, a clinical decision support system and a handbook were 
      provided for 6 weeks, and for nurses in the control group, only a handbook was 
      provided. Notably, the experimental group exhibited statistically significant 
      improvements in patient-centered caring attitude, pain management barrier 
      identification, and comfort care competence after clinical decision support 
      system implementation. Moreover, patients' symptom interference during the 
      experimental period significantly decreased compared with before the 
      intervention. This study offers insights into the potential of clinical decision 
      support system in refining nursing practices and nurturing patient well-being, 
      presenting prospects for advancing patient-centered care and nursing competence. 
      The clinical decision support system contents, encompassing postembolization 
      syndrome risk prediction and care recommendations, should underscore its role in 
      fostering a patient-centered care attitude and bolster nurses' comfort care 
      competence.

TI  - Renal protection CT protocol using low-dose and low-concentration iodine contrast 
      medium in at-risk patients of HCC and with chronic kidney disease: a randomized 
      controlled non-inferiority trial.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Although efforts have been made to reduce the dose of Contrast Medium 
      (CM) to improve patient safety, there are ongoing concerns regarding its 
      potential effects on image quality and diagnostic performance. Moreover, research 
      is lacking to establish a lower limit for safe and effective CM dose reduction. 
      To determine whether the image quality of contrast-enhanced liver computed 
      tomography (CT) using a reduced amount of iodinated CM was similar to that of 
      standard liver CT. METHODS: We enrolled participants at risk for hepatocellular 
      carcinoma with decreased estimated glomerular filtration rates (< 60 
      mL/min/1.73m(2)). Participants were randomly assigned to the standard group or 
      the renal protection protocol (RPP) group. In the standard group, images were 
      reconstructed using hybrid iterative reconstruction (iDose), while in the RPP 
      group, low monoenergetic (50-keV) images and deep learning (DL)-based 
      iodine-boosting reconstruction were used. Four radiologists independently 
      assessed image quality and lesion conspicuity. RESULTS: Fifty-two participants 
      were assigned to the standard (n = 25) or RPP (n = 27) groups. The iodine load 
      was significantly lower in the RPP group than in the standard group (301.5 ± 1.71 
      vs. 524 ± 7.37 mgI/kg, P < 0.001). The 50-keV and DL-based iodine-boosting images 
      from the RPP group exhibited higher image contrast than those from the standard 
      group during arterial (3.60 ± 0.65, 3.75 ± 0.60, and 3.09 ± 0.43, respectively) 
      and portal venous phases (4.01 ± 0.49, 3.86 ± 0.42, and 3.21 ± 0.31, 
      respectively) (P < 0.05 for all). Overall image quality was superior in the RPP 
      group (P < 0.05 for all). No significant difference in lesion conspicuity was 
      observed (P > 0.017). CONCLUSIONS: The reduction in image contrast and overall 
      image quality caused by decreased CM can be restored using either low 
      monoenergetic imaging or DL-based iodine-boosting reconstruction. TRIAL

TI  - Respiratory muscle training with electronic devices in the postoperative period 
      of hepatectomy: A randomized study.
PG  - 688-698
LID - 10.4254/wjh.v15.i5.688 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Many studies have been developed with a focus on surgical techniques 
      and drugs, but few that address the importance of rehabilitation in the pre and 
      postoperative period, and the specific benefits for each surgical procedure or 
      type of neoplasm, aiming to minimize respiratory complications in the 
      postoperative period. AIM: To compare the strength of the respiratory muscles in 
      the pre and postoperative periods of hepatectomy by laparotomy and to verify the 
      incidence of postoperative pulmonary complications among the groups studied. 
      METHODS: Prospective, randomized, clinical trial study that compared the 
      inspiratory muscle training group (GTMI) with the control group (CG). After the 
      collection of sociodemographic and clinical data, in both groups, preoperatively, 
      on the first and fifth postoperative days, vital signs and pulmonary mechanics 
      were evaluated and recorded. Albumin and bilirubin values were recorded for the 
      albumin-bilirubin (ALBI) score. After randomization and allocation of 
      participants, those in the CG underwent conventional physical therapy and those 
      in the GTMI underwent conventional physical therapy plus inspiratory muscle, in 
      both groups for five postoperative days. RESULTS: Of 76 subjects met eligibility 
      criteria. The collection of 41 participants was completed: 20 in the CG and 21 in 
      the GTMI. The most frequent diagnosis was 41.5% with liver metastasis, followed 
      by 26.8% with hepatocellular carcinoma. As for respiratory complications in the 
      GTMI, there was no incidence. In the CG, there were three respiratory 
      complications. Patients in the CG classified as ALBI score 3 presented, 
      statistically, a higher energy value compared to patients classified as ALBI 
      score 1 and 2 (P = 0.0187). Respiratory variables, measured preoperatively and on 
      the first postoperative day, had a significant drop in both groups from the 
      preoperative to the first postoperative day (P ≤ 0.0001). When comparing the 
      preoperative period and the fifth postoperative day between the GTMI and the CG, 
      the maximal inspiratory pressure variable in the GTMI was statistically 
      significant (P = 0.0131). CONCLUSION: All respiratory measures showed a reduction 
      in the postoperative period. Respiratory muscle training using the 
      Powerbreathe(®) device increased maximal inspiratory pressure and this may have 
      contributed to a shorter hospital stay and better clinical outcome.

TI  - Progression patterns and therapeutic sequencing following immune checkpoint 
      inhibition for hepatocellular carcinoma: An international observational study.
PG  - 695-707
LID - 10.1111/liv.15502 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Different approaches are available after the progression of 
      disease (PD) to immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) for hepatocellular carcinoma 
      (HCC), including the continuation of ICI, treatment switching to tyrosine kinase 
      inhibitors (TKIs) and cessation of anticancer therapy. We sought to characterise 
      the relationship between radiological patterns of progression and survival 
      post-ICI, also appraising treatment strategies. METHODS: We screened 604 HCC 
      patients treated with ICIs, including only those who experienced PD by data 
      cut-off. We evaluated post-progression survival (PPS) according to the treatment 
      strategy at PD and verified its relationship with radiological patterns of 
      progression: intrahepatic growth (IHG), new intrahepatic lesion (NIH), 
      extrahepatic growth (EHG), new extrahepatic lesion (NEH) and new vascular 
      invasion (nVI). RESULTS: Of 604 patients, 364 (60.3%) experienced PD during 
      observation. Median PPS was 5.3 months (95% CI: 4.4-6.9; 271 events). At the data 
      cut-off, 165 patients (45%) received no post-progression anticancer therapy; 64 
      patients (17.6%) continued ICI beyond PD. IHG (HR 1.64 [95% CI: 1.21-2.22]; 
      p = .0013) and nVI (HR 2.15 [95% CI: 1.38-3.35]; p = .0007) were associated with 
      shorter PPS. Multivariate models adjusted for progression patterns, treatment 
      line and albumin-bilirubin grade and Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group 
      performance status at PD confirmed receipt of ICI beyond PD with (HR 0.17, 95% 
      CI: 0.09-0.32; p < .0001) or without subsequent TKI (HR 0.39, 95% CI: 0.26-0.58; 
      p < .0001) as predictors of prolonged PPS versus no anticancer therapy. 
      CONCLUSIONS: ICI-TKI sequencing is a consolidated option in advanced HCC. nVI and 
      IHG predict a poorer prognosis. Despite lack of recommendation, the continuation 
      of ICI beyond progression in HCC is adopted clinically: future efforts should 
      appraise which patients benefit from this approach.

AB  - Objective: To explore the biological role and clinical significance of 
      ubiquitin-specific protease 7 (USP7) in the carcinogenesis of scar ulcer. 
      Methods: A retrospective observational study combined with bioinformatics 
      analysis was used. The RNA expression profile data of USP7 in tumor and/or its 
      corresponding paracancular normal tissue were obtained from The Cancer Genome 
      Atlas (TCGA) database and the Gene Expression Omnibus database, and the RNA 
      sequencing data were transformed by log(2). The variations of USP7 gene were 
      analyzed by cBioPortal database. The USP7 mRNA expression in tumor and adjacent 
      normal tissue in TCGA database were obtained by using the "Gene_DE" module in 
      TIMER 2.0 database. The survival rates of patients with high and low USP7 
      expression in cutaneous melanoma (SKCM), cervical squamous cell carcinoma (CESC), 
      lung squamous cell carcinoma (LUSC), and head and neck squamous cell carcinoma 
      (HNSC) were analyzed using the Gene Expression Profile Interactive Analysis 2 
      (GEPIA2) database, and the Kaplan-Meier survival curves were drawn. Sangerbox 
      database was used to analyze the correlation of USP7 expression in pan-cancer 
      with microsatellite instability (MSI) or tumor mutation burden (TMB) pan-cancer. 
      Through the "correlation analysis" module in the GEPIA2 database, the correlation 
      of USP7 expression in pan-cancer with the expression levels of five DNA mismatch 
      repair genes (MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, PMS2, and EPCAM) and three essential DNA 
      methyltransferases (DNMT)--DNMT1, DNMT3A, and DNMT3B were evaluated. The USP7 
      expression in CESC, HNSC, LUSC, and SKCM and its correlation with infiltration of 
      immune cells (B cells, CD4(+) T cells, CD8(+) T cells, neutrophils, macrophages, 
      and dendritic cells) were analyzed by the "Immune-Gene" module in TIMER 2.0 
      database. The "Similar Genes Detection" module of GEPIA2 database was used to 
      obtain the top 100 protein sets with similar expression patterns to USP7. 
      Intersection analysis was performed between the aforementioned protein sets and 
      the top 50 protein sets that were directly physically bound to USP7 obtained by 
      using the STRING database. Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) and 
      Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment analysis were performed for the two protein sets 
      mentioned above using the DAVID database. The samples of normal skin, 
      hypertrophic scar, scar ulcer, and scar carcinoma with corresponding 
      clinicopathologic features were collected from the Department of Pathology of 
      Tongren Hospital of Wuhan University & Wuhan Third Hospital from October 2018 to 
      October 2022, and the USP7 expression in tissue was detected by 
      immunohistochemical method, with the number of samples of 6. Data were 
      statistically analyzed with Log-rank test, one-way analysis of variance, and 
      Bonferroni test. Results: In pan-cancer, the main gene variations of USP7 were 
      mutation and amplification, and the top 3 tumors with the highest variation 
      frequency (>6%) were bladder urothelial carcinoma, SKCM, and endometrial 
      carcinoma. The main mutation of USP7 gene in pan-cancer was missense mutation. In 
      SKCM with the highest mutation frequency, the main type of mutation was missense 
      mutation in USP7_ICP0_bdg domain. USP7 mRNA expression in breast invasive 
      carcinoma, bile duct carcinoma, colon carcinoma, esophageal carcinoma, HNSC, 
      renal chromophobe cell carcinoma, hepatocellular carcinoma, lung adenocarcinoma, 
      LUSC, prostate carcinoma, and gastric carcinoma was significantly higher than 
      that in corresponding paracancer normal tissue (P<0.05). USP7 mRNA expression in 
      glioblastoma multiforme, renal clear cell carcinoma, renal papillary cell 
      carcinoma, and thyroid carcinoma was significantly lower than that in 
      corresponding paracancular normal tissue (P<0.05). In addition, USP7 mRNA 
      expression in SKCM metastases was much higher than that in primary tumor tissue 
      (P<0.05). Survival curves showed no significant difference in survival rate 
      between patients with high USP7 expression and patients with low USP7 expression 
      in CESC, HNSC, LUSC, and SKCM (Log-rank P>0.05, with hazard ratios of 1.00, 0.99, 
      1.00, and 1.30, respectively). USP7 expression in colon cancer, colorectal 
      cancer, thymic cancer, and thyroid cancer was negatively correlated with TMB 
      (with Pearson correlation coefficients of -0.26, -0.19, -0.19, and 0.11, 
      respectively, P<0.05). USP7 expression in glioma, CESC, lung adenocarcinoma, 
      mixed renal carcinoma, and LUSC was positively correlated with MSI expression 
      (with Pearson correlation coefficients of 0.22, 0.14, 0.15, 0.08, and 0.14, 
      respectively, P<0.05), and USP7 expression in colon cancer, colorectal cancer, 
      invasive breast cancer, prostate cancer, HNSC, thyroid cancer, and diffuse large 
      B-cell lymphoma were significantly negatively correlated with MSI expression 
      (with Pearson correlation coefficients of -0.31, -0.27, -0.13, -0.19, -0.16, 
      -0.18, and -0.53, respectively, P<0.05). The expression of USP7 in CESC was 
      positively correlated with that of both MSH2 and MSH6 (with Spearman correlation 
      coefficients of 0.51 and 0.44, respectively, P<0.05), and the expression of USP7 
      in HNSC was positively correlated with the expression of EPCAM, MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, 
      and PMS2 (with Spearman correlation coefficients of 0.39, 0.14, 0.49, 0.54, and 
      0.41, respectively, P<0.05), and the expression of USP7 in LUSC was positively 
      correlated with the expression of EPCAM, MSH2, MSH6, and PMS2 (with Spearman 
      correlation coefficients of 0.20, 0.36, 0.40, and 0.34, respectively, P<0.05), 
      and the expression of USP7 in SKCM was positively correlated with the expression 
      of EPCAM, MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, and PMS2 (with Spearman correlation coefficients of 
      0.11, 0.33, 0.42, 0.55, and 0.34, respectively, P<0.05). The expression of USP7 
      in CESC, HNSC, LUSC, and SKCM was significantly positively correlated with the 
      expression of DNMT1, DNMT3A, and DNMT3B (with Spearman correlation coefficients 
      of 0.42, 0.34, 0.22, 0.45, 0.52, 0.22, 0.36, 0.36, 0.22, 0.38, 0.46, and 0.21, 
      respectively, P<0.05). The expression of USP7 in CESC, HNSC, LUSC, and SKCM was 
      positively correlated with CD4(+) T cell infiltration (with Partial correlation 
      coefficients of 0.14, 0.22, 0.13, and 0.16, respectively, P<0.05). Being similar 
      to the pattern of USP7 expression and ranked among top 100 protein sets, the top 
      5 proteins were C16orf72, BCLAF1, UBN, GSPT1, ERI2 (with Spearman correlation 
      coefficients of 0.83, 0.74, 0.73, and 0.72, respectively, all P values<0.05). The 
      top 50 protein sets that directly physically bind to USP7 overlapped with the 
      aforementioned protein set by only one protein, thyroid hormone receptor 
      interaction factor 12. KEGG enrichment analysis showed that USP7 related genes 
      were involved in cell cycle, spliceosome, cell senescence, and p53 signal 
      pathway. GO enrichment analysis showed that USP7 related genes were involved in 
      transcriptional regulation, protein ubiquitination, DNA repair, and cytoplasmic 
      pattern recognition receptor signal pathways. Analysis of clinical samples showed 
      that USP7 expression was significantly higher in hypertrophic scars (0.35±0.05), 
      scar ulcers (0.43±0.04), and scar cancers (0.61±0.03) than in normal skin 
      (0.18±0.04), P<0.05. Conclusions: USP7 may be a clinical biomarker for the 
      progression of cicatricial ulcer cancer.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: This study aimed to update the epidemiology, clinical, and 
      economic outcomes of patients diagnosed with chronic hepatitis B (CHB) infection 
      in Taiwan. METHODS: This is a retrospective observational study using claims data 
      from the National Health Insurance Research Database. Cases were identified 
      between 2010 and 2019 using CHB diagnosis codes and claims for alanine 
      aminotransferase laboratory tests or CHB treatment within one year of the first 
      CHB diagnosis. Patient characteristics, epidemiology, clinical, and economic 
      outcomes were described. RESULTS: A total of 730 154 CHB-diagnosed cases were 
      identified. The prevalence of diagnosed CHB increased from 1.13% in 2010 to 2.43% 
      in 2019, with the highest occurring among those aged 55-64 years (4.76%) and 
      45-54 years (4.37%) and being higher in men (2.98%) than in women (2.21%). The 
      majority of newly diagnosed CHB patients were 35 years of age or older (86.6%), 
      with a median age of 49 years. After a median follow-up period of 6.42 years, 
      12.5%, 7.9%, 2.8%, and 0.35% were diagnosed with cirrhosis, decompensated 
      cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma, and liver transplantation respectively. 
      Among 456 706 incident CHB-diagnosed patients, 17.4% had received at least one 
      CHB medication, with the majority taking entecavir (67.9%). Patients with 
      increasing disease severity had higher healthcare resource utilization, and 
      inpatient costs accounted for 48.9%-65.5% of the overall medical cost in 
      different health states. CONCLUSION: Despite the decreasing incidence of newly 
      diagnosed CHB, the prevalence of diagnosed CHB remains high and poses a 
      significant healthcare challenge owing to the high economic burden associated 
      with the complications of CHB.

TI  - Comparative efficacy and safety of atezolizumab and bevacizumab between 
      hepatocellular carcinoma patients with viral and non-viral infection: A Japanese 
      multicenter observational study.
PG  - 5293-5303

AB  - AIM: This study compared the efficacy and safety of atezolizumab and bevacizumab 
      (Atez/Bev) in patients with viral and non-viral infection in clinical settings. 
      METHODS: We conducted the retrospective cohort study of 323 BCLC stage B or C 
      hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients with Child-Pugh class A, and a 
      performance status of 0 or 1 who started Atez/Bev from September 2020 to December 
      2021 at 22 institutions in Japan. Patients with viral infection was defined as 
      those who were either serum anti-HCV- Ab or HBs-Ag-positive, while patients with 
      non-viral infection was defined as those who were both serum anti-HCV Ab- and 
      HBs-Ag-negative. We constructed a propensity-score-matched cohort to minimize the 
      risk of observable potential confounders. RESULTS: Propensity score matching 
      produced 126 matched pairs for patients with viral versus non-viral infection. 
      After matching, the significant differences in baseline demographic features did 
      not exist between the two groups. The objective response rate was 20.6% and 24.6% 
      in viral- and non-viral-related HCC patients, respectively, without a significant 
      difference (p = 0.55). The disease control rate was not also significantly 
      different (68.3% vs 69.0%, p = 1.00). The median progression-free survival was 
      7.0 months (95% confidence interval [CI] 6.0-9.6) and 6.2 months (95% CI 5.1-7.8) 
      in patients with viral and non-viral infection, and the 12-month survival rates 
      were 65.5% (95% CI 50.8-76.8) and 71.7% (95% CI 57.3-81.9) in those with viral 
      and non-viral infection, respectively, which were not significantly different 
      (p = 0.33, p = 0.38). No significant difference in treatment-related adverse 
      events was found between the two groups. CONCLUSIONS: Our etiology-based study 
      demonstrated that Atez/Bev showed good efficacy and safety for HCC patient with 
      non-viral infection as well as those with viral infection.

TI  - Construction and validation of a SEER-based prognostic nomogram for young and 
      middle-aged males patients with hepatocellular carcinoma.
PG  - 10099-10108

AB  - BACKGROUND: Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the most common digestive tumor, 
      and we aimed to develop and validate nomogram models, predicting the overall 
      survival (OS) of young and middle-aged male patients with HCC. METHODS: We 
      extracted eligible data from relevant patients between 2000 and 2017 from the 
      Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database. In addition, 
      randomly divided all patients into two groups (training and validation = 7:3). 
      The nomogram was established using effective risk factors based on univariate and 
      multivariate analysis. The area under the time-dependent curve, calibration 
      plots, and decision curve analysis (DCA) were used to evaluate the effective 
      performance of the nomogram. The risk stratifications of the nomogram and the 
      AJCC criteria-based tumor stage were compared. RESULTS: 11 variables were 
      selected by univariate and multivariate analysis to establish the nomogram of 
      HCC. The AUC values of 3, 4, and 5 years of the time-ROC curve are 0.858, 0.862 
      and 0.859 for the training cohort, and 0.858, 0.877 and 0.869 for the validation 
      cohort, respectively, indicating that the nomogram has a good ability of 
      discrimination. The calibration plots showed favorable consistency between the 
      prediction of the nomogram and actual observations in both the training and 
      validation cohorts. In addition, the decision curve DCA showed that the nomogram 
      was clinically useful and had better discriminative ability to recognize patients 
      at high risk than the AJCC criteria-based tumor stage. CONCLUSION: Prognostic 
      nomogram of young and middle-aged male patients with HCC was developed and 
      validated to help clinicians evaluate the prognosis of patients.

TI  - Sorafenib for 9,923 Patients with Hepatocellular Carcinoma: An Analysis from 
      National Health Insurance Claim Data in South Korea.
PG  - 116-124
LID - 10.5009/gnl220406 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND/AIMS: Sorafenib is the standard of care in the management of advanced 
      hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The purpose of this study was to investigate the 
      characteristics, treatment patterns and outcomes of sorafenib among HCC patients 
      in South Korea. METHODS: This population-based retrospective, single-arm, 
      observational study used the Korean National Health Insurance database to 
      identify patients with HCC who received sorafenib between July 1, 2008, and 
      December 31, 2014. A total of 9,923 patients were recruited in this study. 
      RESULTS: Among 9,923 patients, 6,669 patients (68.2%) received loco-regional 
      therapy prior to sorafenib, and 1,565 patients (15.8%) received combination 
      therapy with concomitant sorafenib; 2,591 patients (26.1%) received rescue 
      therapy after sorafenib, and transarterial chemoembolization was the most common 
      modality applied in 1,498 patients (15.1%). A total of 3,591 patients underwent 
      rescue therapy after sorafenib, and the median overall survival was 14.5 months 
      compared to 4.6 months in 7,332 patients who received supportive care after 
      sorafenib. The mean duration of sorafenib administration in all patients was 
      105.7 days; 7,023 patients (70.8%) received an initial dose of 600 to 800 mg. The 
      longest survival was shown in patients who received the recommended dose of 800 
      mg, subsequently reduced to 400 mg (15.0 months). The second longest survival was 
      demonstrated in patients with a starting dose of 800 mg, followed by a dose 
      reduction to 400-600 mg (9.6 months). CONCLUSIONS: Real-life data show that the 
      efficacy of sorafenib seems similar to that observed in clinical trials, 
      suggesting that appropriate subsequent therapy after sorafenib might prolong 
      patient survival.

TI  - Comparing the accuracy of positive and negative indocyanine green staining in 
      guiding laparoscopic anatomical liver resection: protocol for a randomised 
      controlled trial.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Knowledge of the clinical liver anatomy has evolved with advanced 
      imaging modalities and laparoscopic surgery. Therefore, precise anatomical 
      resection knowledge has become the standard treatment for primary and secondary 
      liver cancer. Segmentectomy, a parenchymal-preserving approach, is regarded as an 
      option for anatomical resections in patients with impaired liver. Indocyanine 
      green (ICG) staining is a promising method for understanding the anatomical 
      borders of the liver segments. There are two methods of ICG staining (positive 
      and negative), and the superiority of either approach has not been determined to 
      date. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: This is a prospective randomised controlled 
      superiority clinical trial performed in a single centre tertiary hospital in 
      Japan. A comparison between the accuracy of positive and negative ICG staining in 
      guiding laparoscopic anatomical liver resection is planned in this study. 
      Possible candidates are patients with liver malignant tumours in whom 
      laparoscopic monosegmentectomy or subsegmentectomy is planned. Fifty patients 
      will be prospectively allocated into the following two groups: group A, 
      ICG-negative staining group, and group B, ICG-positive staining group. The 
      optimal dose of ICG for positive staining will be determined during the 
      preparation phase. To assess the ability of the ICG fluorescence guidance in 
      anatomical resection, the primary endpoint is the success rate of ICG staining, 
      which consists of a SOS based on three components: superficial demarcation in the 
      liver surface, visualisation of the parenchymal borders and consistency with the 
      preoperative three-dimensional simulation. The secondary endpoints are the 
      evaluation of short-term surgical outcomes and recurrence-free survival. ETHICS 
      AND DISSEMINATION: The study was approved by Ageo Central General Hospital 
      Clinical Research Ethical Committee (No: 1044) and it carried out following the 
      Declaration of Helsinki (2013 revision). Informed consent will be taken from the 
      patients before participating. The findings will be disseminated through 
      peer-reviewed publications, scientific meetings and conferences. TRIAL

TI  - A Phase I Study to Investigate the Safety, Tolerability and Pharmacokinetics of 
      Napabucasin Combined with Sorafenib in Japanese Patients with Unresectable 
      Hepatocellular Carcinoma.
PG  - 99-107
LID - 10.1007/s40268-023-00416-8 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: For patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma 
      (HCC), the standard of care for many years has been sorafenib. Preliminary data 
      have suggested that the combination of the NAD(P)H:quinone oxidoreductase 1 
      bioactivatable agent napabucasin plus sorafenib may improve clinical outcomes in 
      patients with HCC. In this phase I, multicenter, uncontrolled, open-label study, 
      we evaluated napabucasin (480 mg/day) plus sorafenib (800 mg/day) in Japanese 
      patients with unresectable HCC. METHODS: Adults with unresectable HCC and an 
      Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0 or 1 were enrolled in 
      a 3 + 3 trial design. The occurrence of dose-limiting toxicities was assessed 
      through 29 days from the start of napabucasin administration. Additional 
      endpoints included safety, pharmacokinetics, and preliminary antitumor efficacy. 
      RESULTS: In the six patients who initiated treatment with napabucasin, no 
      dose-limiting toxicities occurred. The most frequently reported adverse events 
      were diarrhea (83.3%) and palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia syndrome (66.7%), all 
      of which were grade 1 or 2. The pharmacokinetic results for napabucasin were 
      consistent with prior publications. The best overall response (per Response 
      Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors [RECIST] version 1.1) was stable disease in 
      four patients. Using Kaplan-Meier methodology, the 6-month progression-free 
      survival rate was 16.7% per RECIST 1.1 and 20.0% per modified RECIST for HCC. The 
      12-month overall survival rate was 50.0%. CONCLUSIONS: These findings confirm the 
      viability of napabucasin plus sorafenib treatment, and there were no safety or 
      tolerability concerns in Japanese patients with unresectable HCC. CLINICAL TRIAL

PG  - 1272-1281
LID - 10.1097/LVT.0000000000000227 [doi]
AB  - Considerable controversy exists regarding the superiority of tenofovir disoproxil 
      fumarate (TDF) over entecavir (ETV) for reducing the risk of HCC. This study 
      aimed to compare outcomes of ETV versus TDF after liver transplantation (LT) in 
      patients with HBV-related HCC. We performed a multicenter observational study 
      using data from the Korean Organ Transplantation Registry. A total of 845 
      patients who underwent LT for HBV-related HCC were divided into 2 groups 
      according to oral nucleos(t)ide analogue used for HBV prophylaxis post-LT: ETV 
      group (n = 393) and TDF group (n = 452). HCC recurrence and overall death were 
      compared in naïve and propensity score (PS)-weighted populations, and the 
      likelihood of these outcomes according to the use of ETV or TDF were analyzed 
      with various Cox models. At 1, 3, and 5 years, the ETV and TDF groups had similar 
      HCC recurrence-free survival (90.7%, 85.6%, and 84.1% vs. 90.9%, 84.6%, and 
      84.2%, respectively, p = 0.98) and overall survival (98.4%, 94.7%, and 93.5% vs. 
      99.3%, 95.8%, and 94.9%, respectively, p = 0.48). The propensity score-weighted 
      population showed similar results. In Cox models involving covariates adjustment, 
      propensity score-weighting, competing risk regression, and time-dependent 
      covariates adjustment, both groups showed a similar risk of HCC recurrence and 
      overall death. In subgroup analyses stratified according to HCC burden (Milan 
      criteria, Up-to-7 criteria, French alpha-fetoprotein risk score), 
      pretransplantation locoregional therapy, and salvage LT, neither ETV nor TDF was 
      superior. In conclusion, ETV and TDF showed mutual noninferiority for HCC 
      outcomes when used for HBV prophylaxis after LT.

AB  - BACKGROUND: At present, the main clinical application of local ablation therapy, 
      such as radiofrequency ablation (RFA), is to heat the tissue to a certain 
      temperature. However, high temperature will cause thermal damage. Irreversible 
      electroporation (IRE) is a novel minimally invasive local ablation technology for 
      tumors. By high-frequency pulse, the tumor cell membrane can be irretrievably 
      perforated, resulting in the destruction of the intracellular environment, which 
      can preserve important structures in the treatment area. However, there are no 
      randomized controlled clinical trials comparing the efficacy of IRE with 
      traditional local ablation in the treatment of liver cancer. AIMS: This study 
      aims to conduct a randomized controlled clinical trial comparing the efficacy of 
      IRE with RFA in the treatment of liver cancer. METHODS: We will conduct a 
      multicenter, randomized, parallel-controlled non-inferiority clinical trial to 
      compare the efficacy and safety of IRE and RFA for hepatocellular carcinoma 
      (HCC). One hundred and ninety patients with HCC from five academic medical 
      centers will be enrolled. The patients will be randomized into treatment arm 
      (IRE) and control arm (RFA). The primary outcome is the progress -free survival 
      (PFS) and the key secondary outcome is the Overall survival (OS). RESULTS: 
      Forty-eight patients had been recruited from 5 centers, of which, 33 patients 
      (median age, 59.1 years) with 38 tumors had completed the 1-month follow-up and 
      21 patients have complete the 3-month follow up, with 2.3 months median follow up 
      period. The mean largest tumor diameter is 3.9 cm. No end point was observed for 
      PFS or OS in both groups, and the complete ablation rate was 100% in both groups. 
      The lesions in the IRE group showed obvious shrinkage 1 month after procedure. 
      One major adverse event (AE) was occurred in the control group. CONCLUSION: This 
      is the first randomized controlled clinical trial to compare the clinical effects 
      of IRE and RFA. The preliminary results suggest that both RFA and IRE are 
      effective in the treatment of HCC, which can provide strong evidence for the use 
      of IRE in HCC and provide more options for the treatment of patients with HCC.

TI  - Efficacy and safety of hepatic arterial infusion chemotherapy combined with

AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study aimed at ascertaining the efficacy and safety of hepatic 
      arterial infusion chemotherapy (HAIC) combined with donafenib versus HAIC alone 
      in the treatment of unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). METHODS: Seventy 
      HCC patients were enrolled for our study, and they were randomized by simple 
      randomization using computer-generated random numbers into two groups: control 
      group and observation group. Regular follow-up reviews were conducted to assess 
      the efficacy of treatments. The levels of apoptotic factors, the levels of 
      hepatic fibrosis indices, the levels of serum tumor vascular factors and tumor 
      markers, and the occurrence of adverse reactions in the two groups were recorded 
      and compared. RESULTS: Disease control rate, objective response rate, and 
      progression-free survival (PFS) of patients in the observation group were higher 
      in contrast to the control group. After 12 weeks of treatment, lower mRNA 
      expression of c-mesenchymal-epithelial transition factor, telomerase, and Fas 
      Ligand and higher mRNA expression of Fas and Caspase-3 were observed in HCC 
      tissues of the observation group versus the control group (p < 0.05); lower 
      detection values of serum laminin, hyaluronic acid, collage type IV, vascular 
      endothelial growth factor receptor 2, and alpha-fetal protein (AFP) were noted in 
      HCC patients of the observation group in comparison to the control group 
      (p < 0.05); there was no difference in the incidence of adverse reactions between 
      the two groups. CONCLUSION: Donafenib combined with HAIC in the treatment of 
      unresectable HCC patients can notably reduce serum AFP levels, improve hepatic 
      fibrosis, enhance short-term efficacy, prolong PFS, and have a favorable safety 
      profile.

TI  - Prevention of radiation-induced liver toxicity after interstitial HDR 
      brachytherapy by pentoxifylline and ursodeoxycholic acid: patient compliance and 
      outcome in a randomized trial.
PG  - 9043-9049
LID - 10.1007/s00432-023-04832-w [doi]
AB  - AIM: To investigate the impact of pentoxifylline (PTX, 3 × 400 mg per day) and 
      ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA, 3 × 250 mg per day) administered for 12 weeks on 
      radiation-induced liver toxicity. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Inclusion criteria were 
      liver metastases of extrahepatic malignancies undergoing HDR-BT. 36 patients were 
      prospectively randomized to the medication (N = 18) or control arm (N = 18) and 
      follow-up by hepatobiliary magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was scheduled 6 and 
      12 weeks after local ablation by HDR-BT. We determined the threshold doses of 
      fRILI by image fusion of MRI with the dosimetry data. RESULTS: 32 patients 
      completed the study schedule. Per-protocol treatment was limited to 8 patients in 
      the medication group and 16 patients in the control group. 22 adverse events of 
      any grade likely or certainly related to PTX were recorded in 12 patients leading 
      to the discontinuation of the study medication in 7 patients and to a dose 
      reduction of PTX in 2 patients. In the per-protocol population, statistical 
      analysis failed to prove a reduction of fRILI 6 and 12 weeks after HDR-BT. The 
      incidence of adverse effects attributed to PTX (70.6%) was well above the data 
      found in the literature for its approved indication. CONCLUSION: The study 
      endpoint was not met mainly attributed to the low statistical power of the small 
      per-protocol cohort. Independently, PTX cannot be recommended for the reduction 
      of radiation-induced liver toxicity in oncologic patients undergoing HDR-BT of 
      liver metastases. Further studies might focus on a combination of UDCA with other 
      potential drugs to help establish a preventive and tolerable regimen.

TI  - Efficacy of doxorubicin and lipiodol therapy by trans-arterial chemoembolization 
      in hepatocellular carcinoma Egyptian patients and relation to genetic 
      polymorphisms.
PG  - 1009-1020

AB  - BACKGROUND: Genetic polymorphisms play a crucial role in predicting treatment 
      efficacy in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). This study aims to 
      evaluate the response to Transarterial Chemoembolization (TACE) in relation to 
      the genetic polymorphisms of interleukin 28B (IL28B) and angiopoietin-2 (ANGPT2) 
      in HCC patients. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Prospective cohort study conducted 
      on 104 eligible HCC Egyptian patients who underwent TACE using doxorubicin and 
      lipiodol. Genotyping of the IL28B and ANGPT2 genes was performed with laboratory 
      data analysis. RESULTS: At baseline IL28B rs12979860 genotypes C/T, C/C and T/T 
      appeared in 43.9%, 34.6% and 21.5% while ANGPT2 rs55633437 genotypes C/C, C/A and 
      A/A found in 71.03%, 28.04% and 0.93% of patients respectively. After one month 
      of therapy, 51.4% of patients achieved a complete response. There was a 
      significant difference in relation to IL28B rs12979860 genotypes (p = 0.017) 
      whereas ANGPT2 rs55633437 genotypes (p = 0.432) showed no significant difference 
      in patient response after one month of TACE. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates 
      the effectiveness of TACE in Egyptian HCC patients, as evidenced by low 
      recurrence rates. Furthermore, the IL28B rs12979860 (C/T) gene may be associated 
      with the efficacy and prognosis of TACE treatment in HCC Egyptian patients. TRIAL 
      REGISTRATION: The trial is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (CT.gov identifier: 
      NCT05291338).

TI  - Eight versus twelve weeks of sofosbuvir-velpatasvir in treatment-naïve 
      non-cirrhotic patients with chronic hepatitis C virus infection: Study protocol 
      for a multicentric, open labelled, randomized, non-inferiority trial (RESOLVE 
      trial).
PG  - e0285725

AB  - BACKGROUND: Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is a common cause of liver cirrhosis and 
      hepatocellular carcinoma. Globally, nearly 71 million people have chronic HCV 
      infection, and approximately 399,000 dies annually. In patients without 
      cirrhosis, HCV infection is treated with 12 weeks of sofosbuvir/velpatasvir 
      combination. Results from available small, single-centre observational studies 
      suggest that the sofosbuvir/velpatasvir combination given for 8 weeks may be as 
      effective as the standard 12 weeks of treatment. We propose to compare the 
      treatment response of 12 weeks versus 8 weeks of sofosbuvir/velpatasvir in 
      non-cirrhotic people with chronic HCV infection. METHODS: This multicentric, 
      randomized, open-label, non-inferiority trial will include 880 (2 arms x 440) 
      treatment naïve, viraemic (HCV RNA >10,000 IU/mL), non-cirrhotic adults (age >18 
      years) with chronic hepatitis C. People who are at high-risk for HCV reinfection 
      such as haemophiliacs, people who inject drugs, those on maintenance hemodialysis 
      or having HIV will be excluded. The presence or absence of cirrhosis will be 
      determined with a combination of history, examination, ultrasound, liver 
      stiffness measured with transient elastography, APRI, FIB-4, and 
      esophagogastroduodenoscopy. Participants will be randomized to receive either 8- 
      or 12-week sofosbuvir/velpatasvir treatment. A blood specimen will be collected 
      before starting the treatment (to determine the HCV genotype), after 4 weeks of 
      treatment (for early virological response), and at 12 weeks after treatment 
      discontinuation for SVR12. DISCUSSION: The study will provide data on the 
      efficacy of 8 weeks of treatment as compared to the standard of care (12 weeks) 
      in non-cirrhotic patients with chronic HCV infection. Treatment for a shorter 
      duration may improve treatment compliance, reduce the cost of treatment, and ease 
      the treatment implementation from a public health perspective. TRIAL

AB  - Purpose: The purpose of this prospective observational study was to investigate 
      the relationship between pretreatment neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) and 
      posttreatment early tumor shrinkage (ETS), and clinical outcomes in patients with 
      unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (uHCC) who received lenvatinib, programmed 
      death-1 inhibitors plus transcatheter arterial chemoembolization. Patients and 
      Methods: A total of 63 uHCC patients were treated with this triple combination. 
      Multivariate analyses to determine the independent factors associated with 
      overall survival (OS) were employed. The link between NLR and clinical results 
      was further analyzed. Furthermore, the predictive value of combining NLR with ETS 
      should be investigated to stratify patients receiving treatment for survival 
      benefits. Results: Progression-free survival and OS were 9.8 and 23.0 months, 
      respectively, with a median follow-up of 20.8 months. On a multivariate analysis 
      of OS, NLR was the only independent prognostic factor. Patients with NLR low 
      (NLR < 3.2) had longer progression-free survival (19.3 vs 7.3 months, P < 0.001) 
      and OS (28.9 vs 16.9 months, P < 0.001), higher objective response rate (86.7% vs 
      39.4%, P < 0.001), and a higher chance of achieving ETS ≥ 10% (ETS high) (73.3% 
      vs 21.1%, P < 0.001) compared with patients with NLR high (NLR ≥ 3.2). The 
      Spearman correlation analysis also showed the strong consistency between NLR and 
      ETS (R(2) = 0.6751). In the subgroup analysis, greater OS benefit was found in 
      the NLR low/ETS high group than the NLR high/ETS low group (χ(2) = 31.258, 
      P < 0.001), while there was no survival difference for patients in the NLR 
      low/ETS low group compared with in the NLR high/ETS high group (χ(2) = 0.046, 
      P = 0.830). Conclusion: NLR has the potential to identify which patients would 
      benefit from this triple therapy, and when combined with ETS, it has the 
      potential to provide greater predictive power in selecting the appropriate 
      candidates for this combination treatment.

AB  - Alterations in signaling pathways and modulation of cell metabolism are 
      associated with the pathogenesis of cancers, including hepatocellular carcinoma 
      (HCC). Small ubiquitin-like modifier (SUMO) proteins and NF-κB family play major 
      roles in various cellular processes. The current study aims to determine the 
      expression profile of SUMO and NF-κB genes in HCC tumors and investigate their 
      association with the clinical outcome of HCC. The expression of 5 genes - SUMO1, 
      SUMO2, SUMO3, NF-κB p65, and NF-κB p50 - was quantified in tumor and adjacent 
      non-tumor tissues of 58 HBV-related HCC patients by real-time quantitative PCR 
      and was analyzed for the possible association with clinical parameters of HCC. 
      The expression of SUMO2 was significantly higher in HCC tumor tissues compared to 
      the adjacent non-tumor tissues (P = .01), while no significant difference in 
      SUMO1, SUMO3, NF-κB p65, and NF-κB p50 expression was observed between HCC tumor 
      and non-tumor tissues (P > .05). In HCC tissues, a strong correlation was 
      observed between the expression of SUMO2 and NF-κB p50, between SUMO3 and NF-κB 
      p50, between SUMO3 and NF-κB p65 (Spearman rho = 0.83; 0.82; 0.772 respectively; 
      P < .001). The expression of SUMO1, SUMO2, SUMO3, NF-κB p65, and NF-κB p50 was 
      decreased in grade 3 compared to grades 1 and 2 in HCC tumors according to the 
      World Health Organization grades system. Our results highlighted that the SUMO2 
      gene is upregulated in tumor tissues of patients with HCC, and is related to the 
      development of HCC, thus it may be associated with the pathogenesis of HCC.

AB  - The objective of this study was to evaluate unidimensional (mm), bidimensional 
      (mm(2)), or tridimensional (mL) computed tomography (CT) tumor measurements for 
      ability to discriminate changes in lesion size and predict survival in dogs with 
      nonresectable hepatic carcinoma treated with drug-eluting bead 
      transarterial-chemoembolization (DEB-TACE) and to compare CT response via 
      Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors 1.1 (mm), World Health Organization 
      (mm(2)), ellipsoid and spherical volume (mL), and percent necrosis, for their 
      ability to differentiate treatment responders. This was a prospective, single-arm 
      clinical trial. DEB-TACE was performed to varying levels of blood flow stasis in 
      16 client-owned dogs with nonresectable hepatic carcinoma. Computed tomography 
      imaging responses were assessed and compared to median survival time. Results 
      revealed that initial, follow-up, or changes in unidimensional, bidimensional, or 
      tridimensional tumor measurements were not associated with survival. Larger 
      bidimensional and tridimensional tumor measurements/body weight on initial and 
      follow-up CT were significantly associated with a shorter median survival time 
      [bidimensional (P = 0.04, 0.016) and tridimensional (P = 0.025, 0.015), 
      respectively]. A higher percent necrosis on initial CT was significantly 
      associated with a shorter median survival time (P = 0.038). Ellipsoid volumetric 
      criteria detected treatment response most frequently; however, response 
      classification was not associated with median survival time. Computed tomography 
      bidimensional and tridimensional tumor measurements/body weight before and after 
      DEB-TACE may help to predict median survival time for dogs undergoing DEB-TACE 
      for hepatic carcinoma.

      Developing a Risk Stratification for Hypervascular Transformation Based on a 
      Real-World Observational Cohort Study.

AB  - PURPOSE: To develop a risk stratification based on MRI features to predict 
      hypervascular transformation for hepatobiliary-phase (HBP) hypointense nodules 
      without arterial-phase hyperenhancement (APHE). MATERIALS AND METHODS: This 
      retrospective observational cohort study included 55 HBP hypointense nodules 
      without APHE in 35 patients with chronic liver disease, cirrhosis, or current 
      hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) who underwent gadoxetic acid-enhanced MRI. The 
      hypervascular transformation during the follow-up MRI(s) was the primary endpoint 
      analyzed for the nodules. Univariable and multivariable Cox proportional hazard 
      regression analyses were performed to identify risk features predicting 
      transformation and assess their predictive value. RESULTS: Among the 55 nodules, 
      27 developed hypervascular transformation, while 28 did not. Diffusion-weighted 
      imaging (DWI) hyperintensity (hazard ratio [HR], 4.98; 95% confidence interval 
      [CI]: 1.60, 15.54; p = 0.006) and portal venous phase (PVP) hypointensity (HR, 
      4.08; 95% CI: 1.43, 11.64; p = 0.009) were associated with hypervascular 
      transformation. DWI hyperintensity and PVP hypointensity had 44.4% (95% CI: 
      26.0%, 64.4%) and 81.9% (95% CI: 61.3%, 93.0%) sensitivity, while their 
      specificity was 78.2% (95% CI: 64.6%, 87.8%) and 67.9 (95% CI: 47.6%, 83.4%), 
      respectively. The specificity of the combination of two features was 100% (95% 
      CI: 85.0%, 100%). The hypervascular transformation rates for nodules with both, 
      either and neither of the risk MRI findings were 100% (10/10), 60.9% (14/23), and 
      13.6% (3/22), respectively; the median intervals for transformation were 312 
      (range: 73-838), 409 (range: 50-1643) and 555 (range: 423-968) days, 
      respectively. CONCLUSION: The combination of DWI hyperintensity and PVP 
      hypointensity may be used as a high-risk indicator for the hypervascular 
      transformation of HBP hypointense nodules without APHE; nodules without either 
      feature may be treated as low-risk nodules and could adopt an extended interval 
      follow-up schedule.

TI  - HCCs lacking arterial phase hyperenhancement (APHE) on contrast-enhanced 
      ultrasound (CEUS) - a diagnostic challenge. Findings from the prospective 
      multicenter DEGUM CEUS HCC trial.
PG  - 606-613
LID - 10.1055/a-2034-1911 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) upon contrast-enhanced ultrasound 
      (CEUS) typically shows arterial phase hyperenhancement (APHE), followed by late 
      (> 60 seconds) and mild contrast washout (WO). Although APHE is considered as the 
      hallmark of HCC, it can be absent in some HCCs. Thus, we explored which 
      sonomorphological and histopathological features of HCC are associated with a 
      lack of APHE upon CEUS. METHODS: Focal liver lesions in high-risk patients for 
      HCC were assessed with CEUS following a standardized protocol in a prospective 
      multi-center real-life setting. CEUS patterns in HCC were assessed, and tumour 
      and patient characteristics were compared for HCCs with and without APHE. 
      RESULTS: 316 patients with HCC were recruited (cirrhosis, 76.9%). APHE occurred 
      in 271/316 HCCs (85.8%). A lack of APHE was associated with portal vein 
      thrombosis, tumour infiltration of the liver vessels (p<0.001), larger size, 
      multilocularity, and higher depth location upon ultrasound (p<0.01). Histological 
      grading did not differ between HCCs with and without APHE (p=0.39). 
      Histopathological features of HCCs without APHE included cirrhotic stromal 
      reaction, marked tumour cell steatosis and absence of the typical surrounding 
      dilated sinusoidal vascular channels. CONCLUSION: Correlation with 
      histopathological findings support the fact that HCCs with a lack of APHE in CEUS 
      are a heterogeneous group. The examiner has to be aware that particularly HCCs 
      with portal vein thrombosis or macro-invasion of the liver vessels may lack APHE.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To explore the clinical characteristics and prognosis of multiple 
      myeloma(MM) patients with secondary primary malignancies. METHODS: The clinical 
      data of newly diagnosed MM patients admitted to the First Affiliated Hospital of 
      Zhengzhou University from January 2011 to December 2019 were retrospectively 
      analyzed. The patients with secondary primary malignancies were retrieved, and 
      their clinical features and prognosis were evaluated. RESULTS: A total of 1 935 
      patients with newly diagnosed MM were admitted in this period, with a median age 
      of 62 (18-94) years old, of which 1 049 cases were hospitalized twice or more. 
      There were eleven cases with secondary primary malignancies (the incidence rate 
      was 1.05%), including three cases of hematological malignancies (2 cases of acute 
      myelomonocytic leukemia and 1 case of acute promyelocytic leukemia) and eight 
      cases of solid tumors (2 cases of lung adenocarcinoma, and 1 case each of 
      endometrial cancer, esophageal squamous cell carcinoma, primary liver cancer, 
      bladder cancer, cervical squamous cell carcinoma, and meningioma). The median age 
      of onset was 57 years old. The median time between diagnosis of secondary primary 
      malignancies and diagnosis of MM was 39.4 months. There were seven cases with 
      primary or secondary plasma cell leukemia, the incidence rate was 0.67%, and the 
      median age of onset was 52 years old. Compared with the randomized control group, 
      the β2-microglobulin level in the secondary primary malignancies group was lower 
      (P=0.028), and more patients were in stage I/II of ISS (P=0.029). Among the 11 
      patients with secondary primary malignancies, one survived, ten died, and the 
      median survival time was 40 months. The median survival time of MM patients after 
      the secondary primary malignancies was only seven months. All seven patients with 
      primary or secondary plasma cell leukemia died, with a median survival time of 14 
      months. The median overall survival time of MM patients with secondary primary 
      malignancies was longer than that of the patients with plasma cell leukemia 
      (P=0.027). CONCLUSION: The incidence rate of MM with secondary primary 
      malignancies is 1.05%. MM patients with secondary primary malignancies have poor 
      prognosis and short median survival time, but the median survival time is longer 
      than that of patients with plasma cell leukemia.

AB  - BACKGROUND/AIM: Extreme hyperbilirubinemia is occasionally observed in intensive 
      care unit (ICU) and non-ICU settings. This study examined the etiologies of 
      extreme hyperbilirubinemia (bilirubin level ≥12 mg/dL) and the factors associated 
      with the 30-day mortality. METHODS: This retrospective observational cohort study 
      identified 439 patients with extreme hyperbilirubinemia at the Gyeongsang 
      National University Changwon Hospital between 2016 and 2020. The patients were 
      classified into three groups and 11 diseases according to their etiology. The 
      risk factors associated with 30-day mortality at the baseline were investigated 
      using the Cox proportional hazards model. RESULTS: Of 439 patients with extreme 
      hyperbilirubinemia, 287, 78, and 74 were in the liver cirrhosis/malignancy group, 
      the ischemic injury group, and the benign hepatobiliary-pancreatic etiological 
      group, respectively, with corresponding 30-day mortality rates of 42.9%, 76.9%, 
      and 17.6%. The most common disease leading to hyperbilirubinemia was a 
      pancreatobiliary malignancy (28.7%), followed by liver cirrhosis (17.3%), 
      hepatocellular carcinoma (10.9%), and liver metastases (8.4%). The etiologies of 
      hyperbilirubinemia, obstructive jaundice, infection, albumin level, creatinine 
      level, and prothrombin time-international normalized ratio were independently 
      associated with the 30-day mortality. CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests three 
      etiologies of extreme hyperbilirubinemia in the ICU and non-ICU settings. The 
      prognosis of patients with extreme hyperbilirubinemia depends largely on the 
      etiology and the presence of obstructive jaundice.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The incidence of non-hepatitis B virus, non-hepatitis C virus 
      hepatocellular carcinoma (non-B non-C-HCC) is increasing worldwide. We assessed 
      the clinical characteristics and surgical outcomes of non-B non-C-HCC, versus 
      hepatitis B (HBV-HCC) and hepatitis C (HCV-HCC). METHODS: Etiologies, fibrosis 
      stages, and survival outcomes were analyzed of 789 consecutive patients who 
      underwent surgery from 1990 to 2020 (HBV-HCC, n = 149; HCV-HCC, n = 424; non-B 
      non-C-HCC, n = 216). RESULTS: The incidence of hypertension and diabetes mellitus 
      was significantly higher in patients with NON-B NON-C-HCC than in those with 
      HBV-HCC and HCV-HCC. Significantly more advanced tumor stages were observed in 
      patients with non-B non-C-HCC; however, better liver function and lower fibrosis 
      stages were observed. Patients with non-B non-C-HCC had significantly worse 
      5-year overall survival than patients with HBV-HCC; overall survival was 
      comparable between patients with non-B non-C-HCC and HCV-HCC. Patients with 
      HCV-HCC had significantly worse 5-year recurrence-free survival than patients 
      with HBV-HCC and non-B non-C-HCC. In patients with non-B non-C-HCC, overall 
      survival was comparable among three periods (1990-2000, 2001-2010, and 2011-2020) 
      despite significant improvement in patients with HBV-HCC and HCV-HCC. CONCLUSION: 
      The prognosis of non-B non-C-HCC was similar to that of HBV-HCC and HCV-HCC 
      regardless of tumor progression at surgery. Patients with hypertension, diabetes 
      mellitus, and dyslipidemia require careful systematic follow-up and treatment.

TI  - Dynamic Changes in Non-Invasive Markers of Liver Fibrosis Are Predictors of Liver 
      Events after SVR in HCV Patients.
LID - 10.3390/v15061251 [doi]
LID - 1251
AB  - Objectives: The course of progressive liver damage after achieving sustained 
      virological response (SVR) with direct-acting antivirals (DAAs) remains 
      undetermined. We aimed to determine risk factors associated with the development 
      of liver-related events (LREs) after SVR, focusing on the utility of non-invasive 
      markers. Methods: An observational, retrospective study that included patients 
      with advanced chronic liver disease (ACLD) caused by hepatitis C virus (HCV), who 
      achieved SVR with DAAs between 2014 and 2017. Patients were followed-up until 
      December 2020. LREs were defined as the development of portal hypertension 
      decompensation and the occurrence of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Serological 
      markers of fibrosis were calculated before treatment and one and two years after 
      SVR. Results: The study included 321 patients, with a median follow-up of 48 
      months. LREs occurred in 13.7% of patients (10% portal hypertension 
      decompensation and 3.7% HCC). Child-Pugh [HR 4.13 (CI 95% 1.74; 9.81)], baseline 
      FIB-4 [HR 1.12 (CI 95% 1.03; 1.21)], FIB-4 one year post-SVR [HR 1.31 (CI 95% 
      1.15; 1.48)] and FIB-4 two years post-SVR [HR 1.42 (CI 95% 1.23; 1.64)] were 
      associated with portal hypertension decompensation. Older age, genotype 3, 
      diabetes mellitus and FIB-4 before and after SVR were associated with the 
      development of HCC. FIB-4 cut-off values one and two years post-SVR to predict 
      portal hypertension decompensation were 2.03 and 2.21, respectively, and to 
      predict HCC were 2.42 and 2.70, respectively. Conclusions: HCV patients with ACLD 
      remain at risk of developing liver complications after having achieved SVR. FIB-4 
      evaluation before and after SVR may help to predict this risk, selecting patients 
      who will benefit from surveillance.

TI  - All-cause and cause-specific mortality in individuals with an alcohol-related 
      emergency or hospital inpatient presentation: A retrospective data linkage cohort 
      study.
PG  - 1751-1762
LID - 10.1111/add.16218 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Alcohol consumption is a leading risk factor for premature 
      mortality globally, but there are limited studies of broader cohorts of people 
      presenting with alcohol-related problems outside of alcohol treatment services. 
      We used linked health administrative data to estimate all-cause and 
      cause-specific mortality among individuals who had an alcohol-related hospital 
      inpatient or emergency department presentation. DESIGN: Observational study using 
      data from the Data linkage Alcohol Cohort Study (DACS), a state-wide 
      retrospective cohort of individuals with an alcohol-related hospital inpatient or 
      emergency department presentation. SETTING: Hospital inpatient or emergency 
      department presentation in New South Wales, Australia, between 2005 and 2014. 
      PARTICIPANTS: Participants comprised 188 770 individuals aged 12 and above, 66% 
      males, median age 39 years at index presentation. MEASUREMENTS: All-cause 
      mortality was estimated up to 2015 and cause-specific mortality (by those 
      attributable to alcohol and by specific cause of death groups) up to 2013 due to 
      data availability. Age-specific and age-sex-specific crude mortality rates (CMRs) 
      were estimated, and standardized mortality ratios (SMRs) were calculated using 
      sex and age-specific deaths rates from the NSW population. FINDINGS: There were 
      188 770 individuals in the cohort (1 079 249 person-years of observation); 27 855 
      deaths were recorded (14.8% of the cohort), with a CMR of 25.8 [95% confidence 
      interval (CI) = 25.5, 26.1] per 1000 person-years and SMR of 6.2 (95% CI = 5.4, 
      7.2). Mortality in the cohort was consistently higher than the general population 
      in all adult age groups and in both sexes. The greatest excess mortality was from 
      mental and behavioural disorders due to alcohol use (SMR = 46.7, 95% CI = 41.4, 
      52.7), liver cirrhosis (SMR = 39.0, 95% CI = 35.5, 42.9), viral hepatitis 
      (SMR = 29.4, 95% CI = 24.6, 35.2), pancreatic diseases (SMR = 23.8, 95% 
      CI = 17.9, 31.5) and liver cancer (SMR = 18.3, 95% CI = 14.8, 22.5). There were 
      distinct differences between the sexes in causes of excess mortality (all causes 
      fully attributable to alcohol female versus male risk ratio = 2.5 (95% CI = 2.0, 
      3.1). CONCLUSIONS: In New South Wales, Australia, people who came in contact with 
      an emergency department or hospital for an alcohol-related presentation between 
      2005 and 2014 were at higher risk of mortality than the general New South Wales 
      population during the same period.

TI  - Effect of side guide marks of ultrasound transducer on the success rate of 
      ultrasound transducer-guided radial artery puncture: A randomized trial.
PG  - 1421-1427
LID - 10.1177/11297298221091415 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Compared with blind technique, ultrasound (US) transducer-guided 
      technique for radial artery puncture can improve the success rate. However, 
      difficulty in handling US transducer-guided technology is a key limitation to its 
      wider use. The aim of the study was to explore the effect of guide marks on the 
      side of US transducer on the success rate of US transducer-guided radial artery 
      puncture. METHODS: In this parallel-group trial, 127 patients undergoing elective 
      liver cancer resection and splenectomy under general anesthesia were randomly 
      allocated to the traditional group or the Intervention group. The traditional 
      group used the conventional US transducer-guided radial artery puncture 
      technology, while the Intervention group used the US transducer-guided radial 
      artery puncture technology with the guide marks on the side of the US transducer 
      probe. The primary observation index was success rate of radial artery 
      cannulation at the first attempt; the secondary observation indices were failure 
      rate of cannulation, location time, and total time for successful cannulation. 
      RESULTS: The successful rate of cannulation in the Intervention group (59 out of 
      63, 93.6%) was greater than that in the traditional group (50 out of 64, 78.1%, 
      p = 0.01). The posterior wall puncture rate in the Intervention group was lower 
      than that in the traditional group (11.1% vs 32.8%, p = 0.005). The location time 
      in the Intervention group was longer than that in the traditional group 
      (20.1 ± 3.8 vs 16.6 ± 4.0 s, p < .001), while the total cannulation time was 
      significantly shorter (20.7 ± 4.3 vs 32.4 ± 7.4 s, p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: Using 
      guide marks on the side of US transducer can help improve success rate of US 
      transducer-guided radial artery puncture at the first attempt and reduce the risk 
      of puncture-related complications.

TI  - First-in-Human Study of INCB062079, a Fibroblast Growth Factor Receptor 4 
      Inhibitor, in Patients with Advanced Solid Tumors.
PG  - 181-193
LID - 10.1007/s11523-023-00948-8 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR)-4/FGF19 pathway 
      dysregulation is implicated in hepatobiliary and other solid tumors. INCB062079, 
      an oral, selective, FGFR4 inhibitor, inhibits growth in FGF19/FGFR4-driven liver 
      cancer models. METHODS: This was a two-part, phase I study (NCT03144661) in 
      previously treated patients with advanced solid tumors. The primary objective was 
      to determine safety, tolerability, and maximum tolerated dose (MTD), while 
      secondary objectives included pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics (plasma FGF19; 
      bile acid salts/7α-hydroxy-4-cholesten-3-one [C4] levels), and preliminary 
      efficacy. In Part 1, patients received INCB062079 starting at 10 mg once daily, 
      with 3 + 3 dose escalation. Part 2 (dose expansion) was not conducted because of 
      study termination. RESULTS: Twenty-three patients were treated (hepatobiliary, 
      n = 11; ovarian, n = 9; other, n = 3). Among six patients receiving 15 mg twice 
      daily, two patients had dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs; grade 3 diarrhea, grade 3 
      transaminitis). Both had high pretreatment C4 concentrations, prompting a 
      protocol amendment requiring pretreatment C4 concentrations < 40.9 ng/mL and 
      concomitant prophylactic bile acid sequestrant treatment. No additional DLTs were 
      reported at 10 and 15 mg twice daily; higher doses were not assessed. The most 
      common toxicity was diarrhea (60.9%). INCB062079 exposure was dose-proportional; 
      FGF19 and bile acid/C4 concentrations increased with exposure. One partial 
      response was achieved (15 mg twice daily; ovarian cancer; FGF/FGFR status 
      unknown; duration of response, 7.5 months); two patients had stable disease. 
      CONCLUSIONS: With C4 cut-off and prophylactic bile acid sequestrant 
      implementation, INCB062079 demonstrated a manageable safety profile and evidence 
      of target inhibition. In view of the rarity of FGF19/FGFR4 alterations and slow 
      patient accrual, the study was terminated before establishing an MTD.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: The exact role of hepatic arterial infusion chemotherapy (HAIC) in 
      advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (aHCC) is still unknown. The combination of 
      HAIC and sorafenib has been proven to be more effective than sorafenib alone in 
      the first-line treatment of aHCC. The aim of the study is to evaluate the 
      efficacy and safety of HAIC plus regorafenib in the second-line treatment of 
      aHCC. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: This is a multicenter, open-label, randomised 
      controlled phase III trial. A total of 294 patients with aHCC, who are unable to 
      tolerate the first-line systemic therapy or progress after the first-line 
      systemic therapy, will be enrolled in the study. The patients will be randomly 
      (2:1) assigned into the combination treatment group (HAIC plus regorafenib, 
      n=196) and the control group (regorafenib alone, n=98). HAIC and regorafenib 
      (160 mg/day) will be given in a 4-week cycle. The primary endpoint is overall 
      survival in the intention-to-treat population. The second endpoints include 
      progression-free survival, overall response rate, time to progression, etc. The 
      radiological assessments will be based on the criteria of Response Evaluation 
      Criteria in Solid Tumors 1.1. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: This study is approved by 
      the ethics committee of Cancer Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences. All 
      participants are required to provide written informed consent. The results of 
      this study will be disseminated through peer-reviewed publications and esteemed 
      academic conferences. TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: Chinese Clinical Trial Registry 
      (ChiCTR2300073075).

TI  - Virtual monitoring for stable chronic hepatitis B patients does not reduce 
      adherence to medications: A randomised controlled study.
PG  - 261-270

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Chronic hepatitis B (CHB) remains common in endemic regions, 
      causing significant healthcare burden. Patients with CHB may need to be adherent 
      to nucleoside analogue (NA) for a long period of time to prevent complications. 
      This study aims to investigate the safety, efficacy and patient experience of a 
      virtual monitoring clinic (VMC) in monitoring stable patients taking NA for CHB. 
      METHODS: Patients on NA and regular follow-up were randomised to either VMC 
      alternating with doctors' clinic visit or to a control group in which they 
      continued standard follow-up by doctors. Therapy adherence was measured by 
      medication possession ratio (MPR) for NA therapy, incidence of virological 
      breakthrough and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) development at two years of 
      follow-up. Patient acceptance was measured on a Likert scale of 1-10. RESULTS: A 
      total 192 patients completed follow-up: 94 and 98 patients in the VMC and control 
      groups, respectively. Mean age was 60.6 ± 10.8 years, with 95.3% Chinese 
      ethnicity and 64.1% males. Age, gender, race, educational, employment and 
      financial status were similar in both groups. Upon study completion, the majority 
      of patients - 76 (80.9%) in VMC group and 74 (75.5%) in control group - had MPR 
      ≥0.8; 88.8% were satisfied and rated VMC better than a traditional follow-up 
      clinic with doctors only. More than 85% of patients rated ≥8/10 on the Likert 
      scale for VMC, and preferred VMC over traditional clinic visits. Clinical 
      outcomes observed were HCC development in one (1.1%) in the VMC group and four 
      (4.1%) in the control group (p = 0.369). Two (2.1%) and one (1.0%) virological 
      breakthroughs were observed in the VMC and control groups, respectively 
      (p = 0.615). No incidence of HCC or abnormal blood tests were missed in the VMC 
      arm. DISCUSSION: VMC is a viable and safe clinical model for monitoring stable 
      CHB patients on NA therapy without compromising patients' adherence to 
      medications and is preferred by patients.

TI  - Evaluating the burden of illness of metabolic dysfunction-associated 
      steatohepatitis in a large managed care population: The ETHEREAL Study.
PG  - 1414-1430
LID - 10.18553/jmcp.2024.24106 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH; formerly 
      nonalcoholic steatohepatitis) is the inflammatory form of metabolic 
      dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (formerly nonalcoholic fatty liver 
      disease). MASH is a progressive disease associated with increased risk for many 
      hepatic and extra-hepatic complications such as cirrhosis, hepatocellular 
      carcinoma, the requirement for liver transplantation, and cardiovascular 
      (CV)-related and kidney-related complications. It is important to understand the 
      clinical and economic burden of MASH. OBJECTIVES: To assess and compare the 
      clinical and economic burdens of MASH in adults with the non-MASH population in a 
      real-world setting. METHODS: This observational, retrospective study used the 
      Healthcare Integrated Research Database (HIRD), which contains health care claims 
      data for commercially insured and Medicare Advantage health plan members across 
      the United States. All-cause, CV-related, and liver-related medical costs and 
      health care resource utilization were evaluated in patients with at least 2 
      diagnoses of MASH during the patient identification period (October 1, 2016, to 
      April 30, 2022) and compared with a non-MASH cohort 1:1 matched on age, Quan 
      Charlson Comorbidity Index, region of residence, and health plan type and length 
      of enrollment. Generalized linear regression with negative binomial and γ 
      distribution models were used to compare health care resource utilization and 
      medical costs, respectively, while controlling for confounders. 
      Covariate-adjusted all-cause, CV-related, and liver-related hospitalization rate 
      ratios and medical cost ratios were assessed and compared for the MASH and 
      matched non-MASH cohorts. RESULTS: A total of 18,549 patients with MASH were 
      compared with 18,549 matched patients in the non-MASH cohort. After adjusting for 
      covariates, MASH was associated with significantly higher rates of 
      hospitalization and higher medical costs compared with the non-MASH cohort. When 
      compared with the non-MASH cohort, patients with MASH had 1.22 (95% CI = 
      1.15-1.30; P < 0.0001) times higher rates of all-cause hospitalization, 1.13 (95% 
      CI = 1.03-1.24; P = 0.008) times higher rates of CV-related hospitalization, and 
      7.22 (95% CI = 4.91-10.61; P < 0.0001) times higher rates of liver-related 
      hospitalization. Similarly, all-cause medical costs were 1.26 (95% CI = 
      1.22-1.30; P < 0.0001) times higher, CV-related medical costs were 1.66 (95% CI = 
      1.59-1.73; P < 0.0001) times higher, and liver-related medical costs were 7.79 
      (95% CI = 7.42-8.17; P < 0.0001) times higher among patients with MASH. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Compared with those of the non-MASH cohort with similar age, Quan 
      Charlson Comorbidity Index, health plan, region of residence, and duration of 
      enrollment, patients with MASH had significantly higher all-cause, CV-related, 
      and liver-related hospitalizations and medical costs.

TI  - Suspected focal nodular hyperplasia in male adults: 10-year experience from a 
      large liver centre.
PG  - 2292-2301
LID - 10.1007/s00261-023-03896-z [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Focal nodular hyperplasia (FNH) is commonly found in females of 
      reproductive age. In males, the diagnosis is made more cautiously due to its 
      lower incidence and higher incidence of hepatocellular carcinoma, which can have 
      overlapping imaging features. Follow-up or biopsy is sometimes required. This 
      retrospective study aims to assess management of suspected FNH in male adult 
      patients at our institution over a 10-year period. METHODS: Male adults 
      (≥ 18 years) suspected of having FNH from January 2010-June 2020 were identified 
      using a departmental radiology information system search. Data was collected from 
      radiology reports and patient pathway manager. RESULTS: Of 342 patients with 
      suspected FNH, 62 were male (18.1%; F:M of 4.5:1). We only included patients 
      investigated and followed up by MRI, total of 57 patients. Median age was 
      40 years (range 18-74 years). Background liver disease present in 21/57 (36.8%), 
      majority with hepatic steatosis. Average number of lesions per patient 1.7. 22/57 
      (38.6%) had at least one MRI follow-up using liver-specific contrast with 7 
      lesions demonstrating variation in size (range growth: -3.27 mm/year 
      to + 4 mm/year). In 7 cases, MRI was not definitive; 6 required biopsy and 1 
      resection. Only 2/7 demonstrated malignancy. Of the total 57 patients, 6 have 
      deceased and none due to a misdiagnosed or mismanaged hepatic lesion. CONCLUSION: 
      FNH is relatively uncommon in males, however, our data suggests that lesions with 
      typical MRI characteristics do not require follow-up and diagnosis can be made 
      confidently, similar to females. Any atypical features should prompt a biopsy.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study assessed the cost-effectiveness of radiofrequency ablation 
      compared with percutaneous ethanol injection in patients with early 
      hepatocellular carcinoma in relation to the objective response rate and costs 
      related to the procedure. METHODS: This was a prospective single-center 
      randomized trial. The primary outcome was cost-effectiveness. Secondary outcomes 
      were the complete response rate according to the modified response evaluation 
      criteria in solid tumors 60 days after randomization and the complication rate 
      within 180 60 days. RESULTS: Fifty patients were placed into the following 
      groups: percutaneous ethanol injection (n=23) and radiofrequency ablation (n=27). 
      Fifty-four nodules were randomized (mean follow-up: 205.37 days). The estimated 
      mean hospital cost was US$ 1854.11 and US$ 2770.96 for the Radiofrequency 
      Ablation and Percutaneous Ethanol Injection Groups, respectively. The incremental 
      cost-effectiveness ratio was US$ -2674.59, which is advantageous for 
      radiofrequency ablation. After 60 d, 28 of 29 nodules in the Radiofrequency 
      Ablation Group achieved complete response versus 12 of 22 in the Percutaneous 
      Ethanol Injection Group (RD, 42.01 [95%CI= 20.55-63.24]; p<0.001). Only four 
      early complications were observed among patients treated by percutaneous ethanol 
      injection (p<0.05). Late complications occurred in two and one patient(s) in the 
      Radiofrequency Ablation and Percutaneous Ethanol Injection Groups (p>0.05), 
      respectively. CONCLUSION: Radiofrequency ablation was more cost-effective and 
      achieved higher complete response and lower complication rates than the 
      Percutaneous Ethanol Injection Group within this cohort. REGISTRY OF CLINICAL

TI  - Comparison Between the Efficacy of Spinal Cord Stimulation and of Endovascular 
      Revascularization in the Treatment of Diabetic Foot Ulcers: A Retrospective 
      Observational Study.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: We aimed to compare the effects of spinal cord stimulation (SCS) with 
      those of endovascular revascularization on the treatment of diabetic foot ulcers. 
      MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 104 patients with diabetic foot ulcers who met 
      the inclusion criteria were retrospectively analyzed and classified to the SCS 
      treatment group (n = 46) and endovascular revascularization treatment group (n = 
      46). The quality-of-life scores (Quality of Life Scale for Patients with Liver 
      Cancer v2.0), visual pain analog scale score, lower limb skin temperature, lower 
      limb arterial ultrasound results, and lower extremity electromyography results 
      were analyzed to compare the efficacy of the two treatments for diabetic foot 
      ulcers in the two groups before surgery and six months after surgery. RESULTS: A 
      total of 92 patients (men: 73.9%, mean age: 66.51 ± 11.67 years) completed the 
      six-month postoperative follow-up period. The patients in the SCS treatment group 
      had a higher quality-of-life score (25.54% vs 13.77%, p < 0.05), a larger 
      reduction in pain scores (69.18% vs 37.21%, p < 0.05), and a larger reduction in 
      foot temperature (18.56% vs 7.24%, p < 0.05) than those of the endovascular 
      revascularization treatment group at six months after surgery. The degree of 
      vasodilation in the lower limbs on color Doppler arterial ultrasound and the 
      nerve conduction velocity were higher in the SCS treatment group than in the 
      endovascular revascularization treatment group at six months after surgery (p < 
      0.05). CONCLUSION: SCS was more effective than endovascular revascularization in 
      improving quality of life, relieving pain, improving lower limb skin temperature, 
      increasing lower limb blood flow, and improving nerve conduction in patients with 
      diabetic foot ulcers at six months after surgery.

TI  - Comparative Real Life Egyptian Experience of the Combination of Sofosbuvir Plus 
      Daclatasvir or Simeprevir for 12 Weeks in Naïve Cirrhotic Patients Infected with 
      HCV Genotype 4.
PG  - 207-213

AB  - BACKGROUND: Chronic infection with HCV is progressive worldwide health problem 
      and the core reason for liver cirrhosis, portal hypertension, or hepatocellular 
      carcinoma. HCV-G4 represents the most common threat to transplantation of the 
      liver in Egypt. New interferon-free regimens have been started consuming 
      direct-acting antiviral oral tablets for HCV cure. OBJECTIVES: In the current 
      study, comparing the safety and efficacy of DAAs combination regimens including 
      sofosbuvir with daclatasvir or sofosbuvir with simeprevir plus ribavirin for 
      naïve cirrhotic Egyptian patients infected with HCV-G4 was our main goal. 
      METHODS: We recruited 150 naïve cirrhotic HCV patients from the Tropical 
      patients' clinic at Fayoum General Hospital. They were classified randomly into 
      two groups, group one (n=75 patients) were administrated Sofosbuvir plus 
      simeprevir (400 mg and 150 mg once daily respectively ) for twelve weeks, and 
      group two (n=75 patients) were administrated Sofosbuvir plus Daclatasvir (400 mg 
      and 60 mg once daily respectively) with ribavirin (1-1.2 gm daily weight-based) 
      for twelve weeks. Clinical follow-up, laboratory investigations, and viral PCR 
      were measured to detect treatment efficacy, safety, and any adverse events. 
      RESULTS: Sustained virological response rates (SVR12) were 92%and 90.7% in the 
      first and second groups, respectively. The major unfavorable events were fatigue, 
      arthralgia, and weight loss without statistically meaningful differences between 
      study groups. However, anemia and headache were significantly widespread in the 
      second group (P=0.0161 and 0.0495, respectively). We observed four patients with 
      photosensitivity in group I and not observed in the second group. CONCLUSION: The 
      current study revealed that DAAs are safe and effective in the cure of naïve 
      cirrhotic patients chronically infected by HCV-G4 with better results in those 
      treated with sofosbuvir plus simeprevir regimen.

TI  - Low preoperative serum uric acid is associated with early acute kidney injury 
      after living donor liver transplantation.
PG  - 635-642
LID - 10.1097/JCMA.0000000000001103 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Liver transplantation is treatment option for patients with end-stage 
      liver disease and hepatocellular carcinoma. Renal function deterioration 
      significantly impacts the survival rates of liver recipients, and serum uric acid 
      (SUA) is associated with both acute and chronic renal function disorders. Thus, 
      our study aimed to assess the relationship and predictive value of preoperative 
      SUA level and postoperative acute kidney injury (AKI) in living donor liver 
      transplantation (LDLT). METHODS: We conducted a prospective observational study 
      on 87 patients undergoing LDLT. Blood samples were collected immediately before 
      LDLT, and renal function status was followed up for 3 consecutive days 
      postoperatively. RESULTS: Low SUA levels (cutoff value 4.15 mg/dL) were 
      associated with a high risk of early posttransplantation AKI. The area under the 
      curve was 0.73 (sensitivity, 79.2%; specificity, 59.4%). Although not 
      statistically significant, there were no deaths in the non-AKI group but two in 
      the early AKI group secondary to liver graft dysfunction in addition to early AKI 
      within the first month after LDLT. CONCLUSION: AKI after liver transplantation 
      may lead to a deterioration of patient status and increased mortality rates. We 
      determined low preoperative SUA levels as a possible risk factor for early 
      postoperative AKI.

TI  - Prognosis of Patients with Chronic Hepatitis C Genotype 1b Infection Treated 
      Using Daclatasvir/Asunaprevir after Sustained Virologic Response: A 6-Year 
      Multicenter Prospective Observational Study.
LID - 10.3390/medicina59081436 [doi]
LID - 1436
AB  - Aim and Objectives: Direct-acting antiviral (DAA) therapy can cure chronic 
      hepatitis C (CHC), and daclatasvir (DCV)/asunaprevir (ASV) was the first 
      interferon-free DAA therapy introduced in Korea. Patients who achieve sustained 
      virologic response (SVR) after DAA treatment are expected to have good prognoses. 
      Therefore, in this study, we aimed to investigate the prognosis of these 
      patients. Materials and Methods: This multicenter prospective observational study 
      included patients with CHC who achieved SVR after DCV/ASV treatment. The primary 
      endpoint was hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) occurrence, which was reviewed 
      annually. Results: We included 302 patients (median follow-up duration: 38 
      [16.5-60.0] months; median age: 58 [49-67] years) in the study. Cirrhosis was 
      observed in 103 patients (34.1%), and the median Child-Pugh score was 5.0. HCC 
      occurred in 16 patients (5.3%) within six years post-SVR; these patients were 
      older and had higher cirrhosis prevalence, alpha-fetoprotein levels, and 
      fibrosis-4 index scores than did those without HCC development. Cox proportional 
      hazards analysis revealed that age > 71 years (p = 0.005) and cirrhosis (p = 
      0.035) were significant risk factors for HCC occurrence. Conclusions: Although 
      the prognoses of patients who achieved SVR with DCV/ASV therapy were generally 
      good, the risk for HCC was present, especially in older patients and in those 
      with cirrhosis. Hence, early treatment at younger ages and regular follow-up 
      surveillance after achieving SVR are warranted.

AB  - PURPOSE: To evaluate the efficacy of combination therapy using transarterial 
      chemoembolization with microwave ablation (MWA) therapy vs. MWA monotherapy for 
      hepatocellular carcinomas (HCCs) >3 cm in size. METHODS: This two-arm 
      retrospective observational study included patients with HCCs >3 cm who underwent 
      either combination therapy (29 patients) or MWA monotherapy (35 patients) between 
      2014 and 2020. The treatment outcomes related to primary treatment efficacy, 
      local tumor progression (LTP), tumor control rate, and overall survival were 
      compared between each cohort. RESULTS: The technical success and primary efficacy 
      were 96.56% and 100.00% in the combination therapy cohort, and 91.42% and 100.00% 
      in the MWA cohort, respectively, over a mean follow-up period of 27.6 months. The 
      1- and 3-year rates of LTP-free survival were 78.57% and 69.56% in the 
      combination therapy cohort, vs. 72.45% and 35.44% in the MWA cohort, respectively 
      (P = 0.001). The overall progression-free survival was longer in the combination 
      therapy cohort compared with the MWA cohort (median: 56.0 vs. 13.0 months; P = 
      0.017). With the incorporation of additional locoregional therapy, the overall 
      survival rates were not significantly different, with 1- and 3-year overall 
      survival rates of 100.00% and 88.71% in the combination therapy cohort and rates 
      of 90.15% and 82.76% in the MWA cohort, respectively (P = 0.235). CONCLUSION: The 
      combination therapy provided significantly longer upfront LTP-free survival in 
      HCCs >3 cm when compared with the MWA treatment alone, albeit with similar local 
      tumor control and overall survival rates when accounting for additional 
      locoregional therapies.

TI  - Absorption, metabolism, and excretion of oral [(14)C] radiolabeled donafenib: an 
      open-label, phase I, single-dose study in humans.
PG  - 5
LID - 10.1007/s00280-024-04725-w [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: The study aims to investigate the absorption, metabolism, and excretion 
      of donafenib, a deuterated derivative of sorafenib, in healthy Chinese male 
      volunteers. METHODS: Six healthy Chinese male volunteers were administered a 
      single oral dose of 300 mg donafenib containing 120 µCi of [14 C]-donafenib. The 
      study involved collecting and analyzing plasma, urine, and feces samples to 
      determine the recovery and distribution of total radioactivity, identify 
      metabolites, and assess the metabolic pathways of donafenib. RESULTS: The mean 
      recovery of total radioactivity was 97.31% of the administered dose. Six 
      metabolites were identified, with the parent drug being the major radioactive 
      component in plasma (67.52% of total radioactivity) and feces (83.17% of the 
      dose). The N-oxidation metabolite (M2) was prominent in plasma. Donafenib was 
      predominantly excreted via feces, indicating liver metabolism, with minimal renal 
      excretion. The metabolic pathways of donafenib were similar to those of 
      sorafenib, but the metabolite profiles differed significantly. Notably, the amide 
      hydrolysis metabolite M6, present in sorafenib, was absent in donafenib. 
      CONCLUSION: Donafenib is primarily metabolized in the liver and excreted through 
      feces, with a metabolic profile that differs from sorafenib due to the deuterium 
      isotope effect. These differences in metabolic characteristics may contribute to 
      donafenib's improved safety and efficacy as a treatment for advanced 
      hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).

TI  - Assessing the impact of digital patient monitoring on health outcomes and 
      healthcare resource usage in addition to the feasibility of its combination with 
      at-home treatment, in participants receiving systemic anticancer treatment in 
      clinical practice: protocol for an interventional, open-label, multicountry 
      platform study (ORIGAMA).

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Digital patient monitoring (DPM) tools can enable more effective 
      clinical care and improved patient outcomes in cancer. However, their broad 
      adoption requires ease of use and demonstration of real-world clinical 
      utility/impact. ORIGAMA (MO42720) is an interventional, open-label, multicountry 
      platform study investigating the clinical utility of DPM tools and specific 
      treatments. ORIGAMA will begin with two cohorts that aim to assess the impact of 
      the atezolizumab-specific Roche DPM Module (hosted on the Kaiku Health DPM 
      platform (Helsinki, Finland)) on health outcomes and healthcare resource usage, 
      and its feasibility to support at-home treatment administration, in participants 
      receiving systemic anticancer treatment. Other digital health solutions may be 
      added to future cohorts. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: In Cohort A, participants with 
      metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), extensive-stage SCLC or Child Pugh 
      A unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma will be randomised to a locally approved 
      anticancer regimen containing intravenous atezolizumab (TECENTRIQ, F. Hoffmann-La 
      Roche Ltd/Genentech) and local standard-of-care support, with/without the Roche 
      DPM Module. Cohort B will assess the feasibility of the Roche DPM Module in 
      supporting administration of three cycles of subcutaneous atezolizumab (1875 mg; 
      Day 1 of each 21-day cycle) in the hospital, followed by 13 cycles at home by a 
      healthcare professional (ie, flexible care), in participants with programmed 
      cell-death ligand 1-positive, early-stage NSCLC. The primary endpoints are the 
      mean difference in change of the participant-reported Total Symptom Interference 
      Score at Week 12 from baseline (Cohort A) and flexible care adoption rate at 
      Cycle 6 (Cohort B). ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: This study will be conducted 
      according to the Declaration of Helsinki, and/or the applicable laws and 
      regulations of the country in which the research is conducted, whichever affords 
      the greater protection to the individual. The study received its first Ethics 
      Committee approval in Spain in October 2022. Participants will provide written 
      informed consent in a face-to-face setting. The results of this study will be 
      presented at national and/or international congresses and disseminated via 
      publication in peer-reviewed journals. TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: NCT05694013.

TI  - Utility of guided FNAC and cell block preparation from liver and gall bladder 
      masses: Learning experience from a tertiary care center.
PG  - 1459-1463
LID - 10.4103/jcrt.jcrt_172_23 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Ultrasound- and CT-guided fine needle aspiration cytology (FNAC) 
      increases the accessibility of intra-abdominal masses to the liver and gall 
      bladder with the advantages of low cost and high diagnostic yield. Cell block 
      technique has been known for further increasing the diagnostic accuracy. AIMS AND 
      OBJECTIVES: We aimed to study the effectiveness of FNAC and the cell block method 
      in cytological diagnosis of liver and gall bladder masses. We also followed a 
      step-wise approach to increase the success rate. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A 2-year 
      observational study was done from July 2020 to June 2022. Total 80 guided (CT and 
      ultrasound) aspirations were done from space occupying/mass lesions in the liver 
      [74 (92.5%)] and gall bladder [6 (7.5%)], out of which cell blocks by the plasma 
      thrombin method were prepared in 12 cases (15%). The on-site radiological details 
      were noted, and rapid on-site evaluation was done in 65 cases (81.25%). The 
      prepared cytology slides were stained with Papanicolaou, H and E and May-Grunwald 
      Giemsa (MGG) stain. The cytological diagnosis was noted, and the uses and 
      limitations (if any) were observed in each case. A step-wise structured 
      questionnaire format was developed to assist the reporting pathologist so as not 
      to miss out on important diagnostic observations, if present. RESULTS: FNAC in 71 
      cases (88.7%) gave a conclusive diagnosis. The maximum number of cases were of 
      adenocarcinoma [38 (51.3%)] from the liver followed by hepatocellular carcinoma 
      in 10 cases (13.5%). In gall bladder masses, all 6 cases (100%) were positive for 
      malignancy, out of which 4 cases (66.7%) could be characterized as 
      adenocarcinoma. The cell block preparation was helpful in reaching the diagnosis 
      as well as typing the malignancy in 10 cases (83.3%). The chief limitation 
      observed on conventional cytology smears was inadequate cellularity, which caused 
      inconclusive diagnosis in 9 cases (11.25%). The reporting questionnaire was 
      helpful chiefly in terms of time-efficient reporting in 34 cases (42.5%), 
      increasing the ease and confidence in 69 cases (86.25%) and the advantage of 
      reproducibility of data in all cases (100%) according to the case-by-case 
      evaluation by the reporting pathologists. CONCLUSION: Guided FNAC in conjunction 
      with the cell block technique is extremely helpful in the evaluation of mass 
      lesions of the liver and gall bladder for cytological diagnosis. A proper 
      step-wise approach may be useful to reach a quick and effective diagnosis.

LID - 10.1080/02656736.2023.2235102 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The novel separable clustered electrode system with two adjustable 
      active tips (ICAEs) and a fine multipurpose needle (MPN) for in situ temperature 
      monitoring and adjuvant agent injection was developed and validated in an animal 
      study. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the technical efficacy and 
      complication of the novel electrode system for patients who have small HCC. 
      METHODS: In this prospective, single-center clinical trial, ten participants with 
      14 small (≤ 2 cm, BCLC 0-A) HCCs referred for RFA were enrolled. A novel 
      electrode system consisting of two ICAEs and one MPN with a thermometer and side 
      holes was used for RFA. The RF energy was delivered using a multichannel RF 
      system combining bipolar and switching monopolar modes. Technical success, 
      efficacy, and complications were evaluated on immediate and one-month follow-up 
      CT. RESULTS: Technical success was achieved in 92.9% (13/14) of tumors. One 
      participant withdrew consent after RFA, and technical efficacy was achieved in 
      91.7% (11/12) of tumors. None showed thermal injury to nontarget organs. All 
      patients were discharged the day after RFA without major complications. The 
      active electrode lengths were adjusted in 60% (6/10) of patients during the 
      procedure to tailor the ablation zone (83.3%, n = 5) or treat two tumors with 
      different sizes (16.7%, n = 1). MPN was capable of continuous temperature 
      monitoring during all ablations (100%, 14/14). CONCLUSIONS: RFA using a novel 
      electrode system showed acceptable technical efficacy and safety in patients with 
      small HCCs. Further comparative studies are needed for the investigation of the 
      system's potential benefits compared to conventional electrodes.

TI  - Impact of Direct-Acting Antiviral Therapy on Liver Fibrosis Regression among 
      People with Chronic HCV Infection: Results from a Real-Life Cohort in Patients 
      Who Achieved Sustained Virological Response.
LID - 10.3390/medicina59040814 [doi]
LID - 814
AB  - Background and Objectives: The global prevalence of chronic hepatitis C virus 
      (HCV) infection is 0.8%, affecting around 58 million people worldwide. Treatment 
      with DAAs reduces all-cause HCV mortality by 49-68%. This work aims to determine 
      whether there is liver fibrosis regression (LFR) in patients who achieved 
      Sustained Virological Response (SVR) after treatment with DAAs. Materials and 
      Methods: An analytical, observational, single-center, and cohort study was 
      carried out. The final sample consisted of 248 HCV-infected patients. All started 
      treatment with DAAs between January 2015 and December 2017. Five measurements 
      were performed to determine the fibrotic stage in patients (measured in 
      kilopascals (kPa)) using transient elastography (FibroScan(®), Echosens, The 
      Netherlands). Results: Taking the baseline fibrotic stage as a reference, the 
      distribution in subgroups was as follows: 77 F4 patients (31.0%); 55 F3 patients 
      (22.2%); 53 F2 patients (21.4%); and 63 F0/F1 patients (25.4%). There were 40 
      patients (16.1%) with at least one HCV complication and 13 (5.2%) who developed 
      hepatocellular carcinoma. The overall LFR rate was 77.8% (144 of 185 F2/F3/F4 
      patients, p = 0.01) at the end of the follow-up period. The highest mean 
      FibroScan(®) values were observed in patients with: "male gender"; "metabolic 
      syndrome"; "subtype 1a"; "NRP DAA"; "at least one HCV complication"; "death from 
      HCV complications"; and "liver transplantation requirement". Conclusions: 
      Treatment with DAAs achieved high rates of LFR and a decrease in mean 
      FibroScan(®) values in all subgroups.

TI  - A Novel Preoperative Classification System for Selecting Suitable Surgeries in 
      Liver Transplant Patients with Portal Vein Cavernous Transformation.
PG  - 2427391
LID - 10.1080/08941939.2024.2427391 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: To evaluate the new preoperative Changgung classification (CC) system 
      of portal vein thrombosis (PVT) in choosing suitable operative procedures to 
      reconstruct portal veins during liver transplantation (LT) in patients with 
      portal vein cavernous transformation (PVCT). METHODS: This retrospective 
      observational study analyzed data from allograft LTs performed for various liver 
      diseases. RESULTS: The study included 22 males and 4 females with LT indications 
      comprising cirrhosis (n = 9), hepatocellular carcinoma (n = 12), PVCT (n = 2), 
      liver failure from fulminant hepatitis B (n = 1), dysfunction of transplanted 
      liver (n = 1), and chronic rejection of transplanted liver (n = 1). Patients were 
      classified according to Yerdel (21 Yerdel II and 5 Yerdel III) and CC (C1-C5). In 
      total 16 simple operations were performed on C1-C3 cases and 9 complex operations 
      on C4-C5 cases, with one additional simple operation. The distribution according 
      to the Yerdel classification was 16 simple and 5 complex operations in Yerdel II 
      cases and 1 simple and 4 complex operations in Yerdel III cases. The median 
      follow-up time was 27.5 months with overall one-year and three-year OS rates of 
      88.1% and 83.9% for the cohort. Specifically, the one-year OS rates for patients 
      classified as C1-3 vs. C4-5 were 93.3% and 80.0%, while the three-year OS rates 
      were 86.7% and 80.0%, respectively (p = 0.526). CONCLUSION: The CC proposed in 
      this study shows comparable potential to the Yerdel classification in 
      preoperatively identifying the need for complex surgical techniques in LT 
      patients with PVCT and may also have predictive power for the survival benefits 
      following LT.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: This study aimed to evaluate the safety and preliminary efficacy of 
      serplulimab, a novel programmed death-1 inhibitor, with or without bevacizumab 
      biosimilar HLX04 as first-line treatment in patients with advanced hepatocellular 
      carcinoma. METHODS: This open-label, multicenter phase 2 study 
      (clinicaltrials.gov identifier NCT03973112) was conducted in China and consisted 
      of four treatment groups: group A (serplulimab 3 mg/kg plus HLX04 5 mg/kg, 
      subsequent-line), group B (serplulimab 3 mg/kg plus HLX04 10 mg/kg, 
      subsequent-line), group C (serplulimab 3 mg/kg, subsequent-line) and group D 
      (serplulimab 3 mg/kg plus HLX04 10 mg/kg, first-line). Group D was the only group 
      in which participants received the study treatment in the first-line setting. The 
      primary endpoint was safety. RESULTS: Following previous report on groups A and 
      B, results of group D are herein presented. As of February 7, 2023, 61 patients 
      were enrolled and were followed up for a median of 25.5 months. Grade ≥ 3 
      treatment-emergent adverse events were reported by 29 (47.5%) patients. One 
      patient died from adverse events that were considered related to study treatment. 
      Among the patients with at least one post-baseline tumor assessment (n = 58), the 
      objective response rate was 29.3% (95% CI: 18.1-42.7) as assessed by an 
      independent radiological review committee (IRRC) per RECIST v1.1. IRRC-assessed 
      median progression-free survival was 7.3 months (95% CI: 2.8-11.0), and median 
      overall survival was 20.4 months (95% CI: 15.0-NE), respectively. CONCLUSION: 
      Serplulimab combination therapy with HLX04 showed a manageable safety profile as 
      well as preliminary efficacy in patients with advanced HCC in the first-line 
      setting.

TI  - Hierarchically Positioning Laparoscopic Microwave Ablation in the Therapeutic 
      Span of Early Hepatocellular Carcinoma: A Real-Life Comparative Analysis.
PG  - 1063-1072
LID - 10.1245/s10434-024-16462-8 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Laparoscopic microwave ablation (LMWA) has yet to gain a specific 
      place in treatment guidelines for early hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). This 
      study compared the outcomes of LMWA and trans-arterial chemoembolization (TACE) 
      for early non-resectable patients with HCC, taking percutaneous radiofrequency 
      ablation (PRFA) as the reference treatment. METHODS: A retrospective multicenter 
      observational study was conducted, enrolling non-transplantable, non-resectable 
      patients who had early HCC treated with LMWA (n = 658) from Padua and Milan 
      centers, and with PRFA (n = 844), and TACE (n = 425) from the ITA.LI.CA 
      multicenter database. The matching-adjusted indirect comparison (MAIC) method was 
      used to obtain weighted LMWA and TACE populations similar to the reference PRFA 
      population. RESULTS: Laparoscopic ablation showed an excellent safety profile, 
      and MAIC-weighted early postoperative deaths were comparable among the groups. 
      The MAIC-weighted overall survival was similar between the LMWA (1-, 3-, and 
      5 year survival of 91.0 %, 67.9 %, 47.0 %, respectively) and PRFA (1-, 3- and 
      5 year survivals of 90.0 %, 64.7 %, 46.6 %, respectively) groups (p = 0.678) and 
      significantly better for the LMWA group than for the TACE group (1-, 3- and 
      5 year survivals of 84.7 %, 48.8 %, 33.6 %, respectively) (p < 0.001). Weighted 
      multivariate overall survival analysis and competing risk/subgroup analyses 
      confirmed the non-inferiority of LMWA to PRFA and its superiority to TACE. The 
      LMWA- and PRFA-treated patients had a significantly lower risk of HCC-related 
      death (p = 0.004) than the TACE-treated patients (p = 0.001). Conversely, the 
      groups did not differ significantly in terms of non-HCC-related deaths. 
      CONCLUSIONS: The non-inferiority of LMWA to PRFA, its superiority to TACE, and 
      its applicability to a wide range of presentations with few contraindications 
      support its inclusion among radical therapies for treating early-HCC patients.

TI  - Effect of Medical Accessibility on Long-Term Survival in Liver Transplantation.
PG  - e944839
LID - 10.12659/AOT.944839 [doi]
LID - e944839
AB  - BACKGROUND Medical accessibility is important in liver transplantation (LT) 
      because of the risk of infections associated with the use of immunosuppressants 
      and complications that require continuous treatment, such as biliary stenosis. 
      However, the effect of medical accessibility on LT success rates has yet to be 
      scrutinized. The aim of this retrospective observational study is to determine 
      whether medical accessibility affects LT outcomes. MATERIAL AND METHODS We 
      enrolled patients who had undergone LT at Samsung Medical Center between January 
      2017 and December 2021. The level of medical access was divided into 2 categories 
      (difficult and easy) based on a cutoff of a 120-min commute on public 
      transportation to access LT. Baseline characteristics were calibrated with 
      propensity score matching. The outcomes (overall survival and graft survival) and 
      severity of emergency center visits according to medical accessibility were also 
      investigated. RESULTS A total of 486 patients was included in this study. The 
      median time to reach the hospital by public transportation was 135 min. Sex, 
      Child-Pugh classification, Model for End-stage Liver Disease score, presence of 
      hepatocellular carcinoma, and donor type were calibrated with propensity score 
      matching, and each group consisted of 186 patients. The overall survival (88.3% 
      vs 86.2%, P=0.67, 5-year) and graft survival (98.6% vs 95.4%, P=0.086, 5-year) 
      showed no significant differences between the difficult-to-access and 
      easy-to-access groups. While severity of emergency center visits differed between 
      the difficult group (27.6%) and the easy group (15.5%), the difference was not 
      statistically significant. CONCLUSIONS Medical access to LT did tend to increase 
      emergency center presentation severity but did not affect long-term outcomes.

TI  - SPIRIT and CONSORT extensions for early phase dose-finding clinical trials: the 
      DEFINE (DosE-FIndiNg Extensions) study protocol.
PG  - e068173
LID - 10.1136/bmjopen-2022-068173 [doi]
LID - e068173
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Early phase dose-finding (EPDF) studies are critical for the 
      development of new treatments, directly influencing whether compounds or 
      interventions can be investigated in further trials to confirm their safety and 
      efficacy. There exists guidance for clinical trial protocols and reporting of 
      completed trials in the Standard Protocol Items: Recommendations for 
      Interventional Trials (SPIRIT) 2013 and CONsolidated Standards Of Reporting 
      Randomised Trials (CONSORT) 2010 statements. However, neither the original 
      statements nor their extensions adequately cover the specific features of EPDF 
      trials. The DEFINE (DosE-FIndiNg Extensions) study aims to enhance transparency, 
      completeness, reproducibility and interpretation of EPDF trial protocols 
      (SPIRIT-DEFINE) and their reports once completed (CONSORT-DEFINE), across all 
      disease areas, building on the original SPIRIT 2013 and CONSORT 2010 statements. 
      METHODS AND ANALYSIS: A methodological review of published EPDF trials will be 
      conducted to identify features and deficiencies in reporting and inform the 
      initial generation of the candidate items. The early draft checklists will be 
      enriched through a review of published and grey literature, real-world examples 
      analysis, citation and reference searches and consultation with international 
      experts, including regulators and journal editors. Development of CONSORT-DEFINE 
      commenced in March 2021, followed by SPIRIT-DEFINE from January 2022. A modified 
      Delphi process, involving worldwide, multidisciplinary and cross-sector key 
      stakeholders, will be run to refine the checklists. An international consensus 
      meeting in autumn 2022 will finalise the list of items to be included in both 
      guidance extensions. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: This project was approved by ICR's 
      Committee for Clinical Research. The Health Research Authority confirmed Research 
      Ethics Approval is not required. The dissemination strategy aims to maximise 
      guideline awareness and uptake, including but not limited to dissemination in 
      stakeholder meetings, conferences, peer-reviewed publications and on the EQUATOR 
      Network and DEFINE study websites. REGISTRATION DETAILS: SPIRIT-DEFINE and 
      CONSORT-DEFINE are registered with the EQUATOR Network.

TI  - Efficacy and safety of bintrafusp alfa in 2 phase I expansion cohorts with 
      advanced HCC.
PG  - 32-43
LID - 10.1097/HEP.0000000000001054 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Simultaneous inhibition of the TGF-β and programmed cell 
      death 1 ligand 1 pathways provides a potential novel treatment approach. 
      Bintrafusp alfa, a first-in-class bifunctional fusion protein composed of the 
      extracellular domain of TGF-βRII (a TGF-β "trap") fused to a human IgG1 
      monoclonal antibody blocking programmed cell death 1 ligand 1, was evaluated in 
      patients with advanced HCC. APPROACH AND RESULTS: In this global, open-label, 
      phase I study (NCT02517398), patients with programmed cell death 1 ligand 
      1-unselected HCC who failed or were intolerant to ≥1 line of sorafenib received 
      bintrafusp alfa 1200 mg every 2 weeks in a dose-escalation (n = 38) or 
      dose-expansion (n = 68) cohort until confirmed progression, unacceptable 
      toxicity, or trial withdrawal. The primary endpoint was the best overall response 
      per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors version 1.1 by an independent 
      review committee. Secondary endpoints included investigator-assessed best overall 
      response, safety, and pharmacokinetics. Median follow-up times (range) were 41.4 
      (39.8-44.2) and 38.6 (33.5-39.7) months in the dose-escalation and dose-expansion 
      cohorts, respectively. The objective response rate was below the prespecified 20% 
      objective response rate threshold set to evaluate the efficacy of bintrafusp alfa 
      in both cohorts (10.5% and 8.8%, respectively). Median overall survival and 
      progression-free survival, respectively, were 13.8 and 1.5 months in the 
      dose-escalation cohort and 13.5 and 1.4 months in the dose-expansion cohort. 
      Treatment-related adverse events occurred in 78.9% and 64.7% of patients in the 
      respective cohorts (grade ≥3 in 18.4% and 25.0% of patients). CONCLUSIONS: 
      Bintrafusp alfa showed moderate clinical activity and a safety profile consistent 
      with previous studies of bintrafusp alfa in patients with advanced HCC.

TI  - Portal vein thrombosis compromises the performance of MELD and MELD-Na scores in 
      patients with cirrhosis.
PG  - 129-137
LID - 10.1111/jgh.16053 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: The accuracy of model for end-stage liver disease (MELD) and 
      MELD with sodium (MELD-Na) scores in reflecting the clinical outcomes of patients 
      with cirrhosis and portal vein thrombosis (PVT) remains unclear. This study aimed 
      to evaluate the performance of scores in predicting 90-day mortality in patients 
      with cirrhosis and PVT. METHODS: Post hoc analysis was performed in two 
      prospective cohorts (NCT02457637 and NCT03641872). The correlation between the 
      MELD/MELD-Na score and 90-day liver transplantation (LT)-free mortality was 
      investigated in patients with cirrhosis with and without PVT. RESULTS: In this 
      study, 2826 patients with cirrhosis were included, and 255 (9.02%) had PVT. The 
      cumulative incidence of 90-day LT-free mortality did not significantly differ 
      between patients with and without PVT (log-rank P = 0.0854). MELD [area under the 
      receiver operating curve (AUROC), 0.649 vs. 0.842; P = 0.0036] and MELD-Na scores 
      (AUROC, 0.691 vs. 0.851; P = 0.0108) were compared in patients with and without 
      PVT, regarding the prediction of 90-day LT-free mortality. In MELD < 15 and 
      MELD-Na < 20 subgroups, patients with PVT had a higher 90-day LT-free mortality 
      than those without PVT (7.91% vs. 2.64%, log-rank P = 0.0011; 7.14% vs. 3.43%, 
      log-rank P = 0.0223), whereas in MELD ≥ 15 and MELD-Na ≥ 20 subgroups, no 
      significant difference was observed between patients with and without PVT. 
      CONCLUSIONS: The performance of MELD and MELD-Na scores in predicting 90-day 
      LT-free mortality of patients with cirrhosis was compromised by PVT. MELD < 15 or 
      MELD-Na < 20 may underestimate the 90-day LT-free mortality in patients with PVT.

AB  - Our goal was to assess the coagulation profile in the immediate postoperative 
      time after major liver surgery and its association with the liver function. Our 
      hypothesis is that a decreased synthesis of the coagulation factor levels 
      reflects an impaired liver synthesis following hepatic resection and will be 
      associated with poor outcomes. This is a prospective, observational study 
      recruiting consecutive patients scheduled for major liver resection in a tertiary 
      hospital. Coagulation profile was assessed by conventional assays, viscoelastic 
      assays and coagulation factor levels preoperatively and, on postoperative days 1, 
      2 and 6. Factor VIII to protein C (FVIII/PC) ratio has been used as a surrogate 
      marker of hemostatic imbalance. Liver function was measured with conventional and 
      indocyanine green (ICG) clearance tests, which were obtained preoperatively and 
      on postoperative days 1 and 2. Sixty patients were recruited and 51 were included 
      in the study. There is a clear increase in FVIII/PC ratio after surgery, which 
      was significantly associated with low liver function, being more pronounced 
      beyond postoperative day 2 and in patients with poorer liver function ( P 
       < 0.001). High FVIII/PC ratio values were significantly associated with higher 
      postoperative morbidity, prolonged ICU and hospital stay and less survival ( P 
       < 0.05). High FVIII/PC ratio on postoperative day 2 was found to be predictor of 
      posthepatectomy liver failure (PHLF; area under the ROC curve = 0.8129). Early 
      postoperative high FVIII/PC ratio values are associated with low liver function, 
      PHLF and poorer outcomes in patients undergoing major hepatic resection.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Hand hygiene compliance (HHC) monitoring is almost always done in 
      daytime. Documentation of HHC in health care workers (HCWs) is limited during odd 
      hours and nighttime. The objective of the study was to determine diurnal 
      variation in HHC in different categories of health care workers in tertiary care 
      hospital in North India. METHODS: A prospective, observational study was 
      conducted in 3 COVID-19 intensive care units (ICUs) with closed-circuit 
      television (CCTV) cameras. Dedicated infection control nurses monitored HHC among 
      various HCWs (doctors, nursing staff, technicians, hospital and sanitary 
      attendants) during day and nighttime, in 20-minute durations. The difference in 
      HHC by-professional category and for each WHO moment was assessed using χ² test 
      and P value. RESULTS: A total of 705 opportunities were observed over a period of 
      7 days, with overall compliance of 53%. Day and nighttime compliance was recorded 
      to be 60.7% and 42.1%, respectively (P < .001). HCC was highest amongst resident 
      doctors with little diurnal variation. However, nurses and housekeeping staff 
      exhibited significant diurnal variation. The compliance at "after" moments was 
      much higher than "before" moments in all professional categories. CONCLUSION: 
      There was a significant decrease in compliance during nighttime, amongst all 
      HCWs, with maximum variation exhibited by nursing staff. The present study 
      underlines the importance of monitoring HHC at odd hours, to elicit a more 
      accurate picture round the clock. Health care facilities monitoring compliance 
      only during the daytime may substantially overestimate HHC.

TI  - Possible use of Digital Variance Angiography in Liver Transarterial 
      Chemoembolization: A Retrospective Observational Study.
PG  - 635-642
LID - 10.1007/s00270-023-03420-2 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Digital variance angiography (DVA), a recently developed image 
      processing technology, provided higher contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) and better 
      image quality (IQ) during lower limb interventions than digital subtraction 
      angiography (DSA). Our aim was to investigate whether this quality improvement 
      can be observed also during liver transarterial chemoembolization (TACE). 
      MATERIALS AND METHODS: We retrospectively compared the CNR and IQ parameters of 
      DSA and DVA images from 25 patients (65% male, mean ± SD age: 67.5 ± 11.2 years) 
      underwent TACE intervention at our institute. CNR was calculated on 50 images. IQ 
      of every image set was evaluated by 5 experts using 4-grade Likert scales. Both 
      single image evaluation and paired image comparison were performed in a blinded 
      and randomized manner. The diagnostic value was evaluated based on the 
      possibility to identify lesions and feeding arteries. RESULTS: DVA provided 
      significantly higher CNR (mean CNR(DVA)/CNR(DSA) was 1.33). DVA images received 
      significantly higher individual Likert score (mean ± SEM 3.34 ± 0,08 vs. 
      2.89 ± 0.11, Wilcoxon signed-rank p < 0.001) and proved to be superior also in 
      paired comparisons (median comparison score 1.60 [IQR:2.40], one sample Wilcoxon 
      p < 0.001 compared to equal quality level). DSA could not detect lesion and 
      feeding artery in 28 and 36% of cases, and allowed clear detection only in 22% 
      and 16%, respectively. In contrast, DVA failed only in 8 and 18% and clearly 
      revealed lesions and feeding arteries in 32 and 26%, respectively. CONCLUSION: In 
      our study, DVA provided higher quality images and better diagnostic insight than 
      DSA; therefore, DVA could represent a useful tool in liver TACE interventions. 
      LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: III Non-consecutive study.

TI  - Predictive factors of microvascular invasion in patients with intrahepatic 
      mass-forming cholangiocarcinoma based on magnetic resonance images.
PG  - 1306-1319
LID - 10.1007/s00261-023-03847-8 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: The aim of this retrospective study was to develop and validate a 
      preoperative nomogram for predicting microvascular invasion (MVI) in patients 
      with intrahepatic mass-forming cholangiocarcinoma (IMCC) based on magnetic 
      resonance imaging (MRI). METHODS: In this retrospective study, 224 consecutive 
      patients with clinicopathologically confirmed IMCC were enrolled. Patients whose 
      data were collected from February 2010 to December 2020 were randomly divided 
      into the training (131 patients) and internal validation (51 patients) datasets. 
      The data from January 2021 to November 2021 (42 patients) were allocated to the 
      time-independent validation dataset. Univariate and multivariate forward logistic 
      regression analyses were used to identify preoperative MRI features that were 
      significantly related to MVI, which were then used to develop the nomogram. We 
      used the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) and 
      calibration curve to evaluate the performance of the nomogram. RESULTS: 
      Interobserver agreement of MRI qualitative features was good to excellent, with κ 
      values of 0.613-0.882. Multivariate analyses indicated that the following 
      variables were independent predictors of MVI: multiple tumours (odds ratio 
      [OR]) = 4.819, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.562-14.864, P = 0.006), ill-defined 
      margin (OR = 6.922, 95% CI 2.883-16.633, P < 0.001), and carbohydrate antigen 
      19-9 (CA 19-9) > 37 U/ml (OR = 2.890, 95% CI 1.211-6.897, P = 0.017). A nomogram 
      incorporating these factors was established using well-fitted calibration curves. 
      The nomogram showed good diagnostic efficacy for MVI, with AUC values of 0.838, 
      0.819, and 0.874 for the training, internal validation, and time-independent 
      validation datasets, respectively. CONCLUSION: A nomogram constructed using 
      independent factors, namely the presence of multiple tumours, ill-defined 
      margins, and CA 19-9 > 37 U/ml could predict the presence of MVI. This can 
      facilitate personalised therapeutic strategy and clinical management in patients 
      with IMCC.

AB  - Objective: To investigate the application value of Gd-EOB-DTPA enhanced MRI based 
      radiomics model in the differential diagnosis of iso-or hyperintensity HCC and 
      focal nodular hyperplasia (FNH) in hepatobiliary phase. Methods: A total of 88 
      patients with HCC or FNH confirmed by surgical or puncture pathology who 
      underwent preoperative Gd-EOB-DTPA enhanced MRI (all lesions showed iso-or 
      hyperintensity in hepatobiliary phase) between January 2015 and February 2023 in 
      The First Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University and Nantong No.3 People's 
      Hospital were retrospectively evaluated, which including 58 males and 30 females, 
      aged [M(Q(1), Q(3))]56 (40, 67) years, including 61 patients with HCC and 27 
      patients with FNH. The included cases were divided into training (43 cases of 
      HCC, 19 cases of FNH) and validation cohort (18 cases of HCC, 8 cases of FNH) in 
      the ratio of 7∶3 using the random seeding method. A total of 1 781 radiomics 
      features were extracted from Gd-EOB-DTPA enhanced MRI in the arterial, portal and 
      hepatobiliary phases, respectively. The independent three phase models, combined 
      three phases model and combined clinical-radiomics model was established using 
      Auto-Encoder (AE) and Native Bayes (NB) classifier, respectively. The receiver 
      operating characteristic (ROC) curve was used to evaluate the diagnostic 
      performance of these models. DeLong test was used to compare the areas under 
      curve (AUC). Results: In the validation cohort, the combined clinical-radiomics 
      model had the highest AUC (AUC=0.938, 95%CI: 0.828-1.000). The AUC, accuracy, 
      sensitivity, specificity of the clinical-radiomics combined model using AE 
      classifier in the validation cohort were 0.896 (95%CI: 0.760-1.000), 88.5%, 
      88.9%, 87.5%. The AUC of the clinical-radiomics combined model using NB 
      classifier in the validation cohort were 0.938 (95%CI: 0.828-1.000), 92.3%, 
      88.9%, 100.0%. Conclusion: Gd-EOB-DTPA enhanced MRI combined clinical-radiomics 
      model has certain value in preoperative differentiation of iso-or hyperintensity 
      in the hepatobiliary phase HCC and FNH, with a high accuracy, sensitivity and 
      specificity.

TI  - Left radial vs right femoral: comparison between arterial accesses in c-TACE 
      procedures in terms of operator radiations exposure and patient comfort.
PG  - 1936-1943
LID - 10.1007/s11547-024-01906-8 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: This multicenter prospective study aims to compare transradial access 
      versus transfemoral access in conventional transarterial chemoembolization 
      (c-TACE) procedures, focusing on operators radiations exposure, patients comfort, 
      technical success and vascular access complications. MATERIALS AND METHODS: 
      Patients were affected by hepatocellularcarcinoma (HCC) in intermediate stage or 
      previous stages unfit for ablation and/or surgery; they were randomized into two 
      groups according to arterial access site (Group F: right femoral access in 
      standard position; Group R: radial access with left arm abduced 90°). Overall 
      fluoroscopy time was recorded. Eight thermoluminescence dosimeters were 
      positioned immediately before each procedure to monitor radiation doses. 
      Technical success was intended as complete HCC nodules lipiodolization at final 
      plain cone-beam CT. RESULTS: Group F included 23 patients, while group R 19. Mean 
      fluoroscopy time was lower in group F but difference was not statistically 
      significant (p-value > 0.05). In terms of operators radiations exposure, no 
      significant differences were found (p-value > 0.05). Technical success was 
      obtained in 81.5% in group F and 84.8% in group R, without significant 
      differences (p-value > 0.05). Patients discomfort was significantly 
      (p-value < 0.05) higher in group F. Concerning minor complications, no 
      statistical differences were appreciated (p-value > 0.05); no major complications 
      occurred. CONCLUSIONS: In this study, no statistical differences were observed in 
      terms of operators radiations exposure, fluoroscopy time and technical success 
      during c-TACE performed with left radial access compared to right femoral access; 
      patients comfort was significantly better with radial access. These data should 
      lead interventional radiologists to favor radial access in c-TACE interventions.

TI  - Drug-drug interactions of ritonavir-boosted SARS-CoV-2 protease inhibitors in 
      solid organ transplant recipients: experience from the initial use of 
      lopinavir-ritonavir.
PG  - 655.e1-655.e4

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To review the drug-drug interactions between tacrolimus and 
      lopinavir/ritonavir in 23 patients who received solid organ transplant during the 
      first wave of COVID-19 and to determine the efficacy as well as safety of 
      prednisone monotherapy. METHODS: Observational study performed between March and 
      June 2020 in solid organ transplant recipients admitted with an established 
      diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection who received lopinavir/ritonavir (≥2 doses). 
      Once lopinavir/ritonavir therapy was initiated, calcineurin inhibitor treatment 
      was temporarily switched to prednisone monotherapy (15-20 mg/d) to avoid 
      drug-drug interactions and toxicity. After lopinavir/ritonavir treatment 
      completion, immunosuppressive treatment was restarted with reduced doses of 
      prednisone-tacrolimus (target minimum blood concentration -C(0)- approximately 5 
      ng/mL). Patients were observed for 3 months to confirm the absence of rejection. 
      RESULTS: The median time from discontinuation of tacrolimus to initiation of 
      lopinavir/ritonavir was 14 hours (interquartile range [IQR], 12-15) and from 
      discontinuation of lopinavir/ritonavir to resumption of tacrolimus 58 hours (IQR, 
      47-81). The duration of lopinavir/ritonavir treatment was 7 days (IQR, 5-7). Nine 
      of the 21 (42.8%) patients on tacrolimus treatment had C(0) above the cutoff 
      point after lopinavir/ritonavir initiation, despite having been substituted with 
      prednisone before lopinavir/ritonavir initiation. Three patients had very high 
      concentrations (>40 ng/mL) and developed toxicity. No episodes of acute rejection 
      were diagnosed. DISCUSSION: We did not observe toxicity in patients for whom 
      tacrolimus was discontinued 24 hours before starting lopinavir/ritonavir and 
      reintroduced at half dose 48 to 72 hours after lopinavir/ritonavir 
      discontinuation. Prednisone monotherapy during lopinavir/ritonavir therapy was 
      safe with no episodes of acute rejection. Experience with lopinavir/ritonavir may 
      be applicable to the use of nirmatrelvir/ritonavir, but larger multicentre 
      studies are needed to confirm these findings.

TI  - Efficacy and Safety of Iparomlimab, an Anti-PD-1 Antibody, in Patients with 
      Advanced Solid Tumors: A Phase 1c Study.
PG  - 4153-4171
LID - 10.1007/s12325-024-02981-z [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Iparomlimab (QL1604) is a humanized immunoglobulin G4 mAb against 
      programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1). Here, we report the preliminary efficacy, 
      safety, pharmacokinetics, and immunogenicity of iparomlimab in patients with 
      advanced solid tumors. METHODS: In this open-label, phase 1c study, patients with 
      advanced or metastatic solid tumors, either failed or had no standard therapies 
      available, were enrolled and received intravenous iparomlimab at 3 mg/kg once 
      every 3 weeks. The primary efficacy endpoint was the objective response rate 
      (ORR) assessed by the investigator per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid 
      Tumors (RECIST) version 1.1. RESULTS: Between July 20, 2020, and September 6, 
      2021, 71 patients were enrolled and received at least one dose of iparomlimab. 
      The ORR was 9.9% (7/71) and disease control rate was 36.6% (26/71). Median 
      duration of response of all responders was 10.7 months [95% confidence interval 
      (CI), 1.4-not estimable]. Additionally, the median time to progression, 
      progression-free survival, and overall survival were 1.4 months (95% CI, 
      1.4-2.8), 1.4 months (95% CI, 1.4-2.7), and 9.7 months (95% CI, 7.2-15.3), 
      respectively. A total of 52 (73.2%) patients experienced treatment-related 
      adverse events (TRAEs) (grade ≥ 3, 19.7%). The most common TRAE (≥ 10%) was 
      anemia (18.3%). A total of 20 (28.2%) experienced immune-related adverse events 
      (grade ≥ 3, 7.0%). TRAEs leading to discontinuation of study drug occurred in 4 
      (5.6%) patients, including immune-mediated myocarditis (2 patients), 
      Guillain-Barré syndrome (1 patient), and diarrhea (1 patient). CONCLUSIONS: 
      Iparomlimab showed preliminary clinical activity and had a manageable safety 
      profile in patients with advanced solid tumors. These results support further 
      investigation of iparomlimab as monotherapy or in combination therapy in advanced 
      solid tumors. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov identifier, NCT05801094.

TI  - Validation of the R3-AFP model for risk prediction of HCC recurrence after liver 
      transplantation in the SiLVER randomized clinical trial.
PG  - 45-57
LID - 10.1097/LVT.0000000000000487 [doi]
AB  - Explant-based models for assessing HCC recurrence after liver transplantation 
      serve as the gold standard, guiding post-liver transplantation screening and 
      immunosuppression adjustment. Incorporating alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) levels into 
      these models, such as the novel R3-AFP score, has notably enhanced risk 
      stratification. However, validation of these models in high-evidence data is 
      mandatory. Therefore, the aim of the present research was to validate the R3-AFP 
      score in a randomized clinical trial. We analyzed the intention-to-treat 
      population from the 2-arm SiLVER trial (NCT00355862), comparing calcineurin-based 
      ([calcineurin inhibitors]-Group A) versus mammalian target of rapamycin 
      inhibitors-based (sirolimus-Group B) immunosuppression for post-liver 
      transplantation HCC recurrence. Competing risk analysis estimated sub-hazard 
      ratios, with testing of discriminant function and calibration. Overall, 508 
      patients from the intention-to-treat analysis were included (Group A, n = 256; 
      Group B, n = 252). The R3-AFP score distribution was as follows: 42.6% low-risk 
      (n = 216), 35.7% intermediate-risk (n = 181), 19.5% high-risk (n = 99), and 2.2% 
      very-high-risk (n = 11) groups. The R3-AFP score effectively stratified HCC 
      recurrence risk, with increasing risk for each stratum. Calibration of the R3-AFP 
      model significantly outperformed other explant-based models (Milan, Up-to-7, and 
      RETREAT), whereas discrimination power (0.75 [95% CI: 0.69; 0.81]) surpassed 
      these models, except for the RETREAT model ( p = 0.49). Subgroup analysis showed 
      lower discrimination power in the mammalian target of rapamycin group versus the 
      calcineurin inhibitors group ( p = 0.048). In conclusion, the R3-AFP score 
      accurately predicted HCC recurrence using high-quality evidence-based data, 
      exhibiting reduced performance under mammalian target of rapamycin 
      immunosuppression. This highlights the need for further research to evaluate 
      surveillance schedules and adjuvant regimens.

AB  - This study evaluated the long-term efficacy and safety of the widely used drugs 
      entecavir (ETV) and tenofovir alafenamide (TAF), as well as the incidence of 
      HCC.A nonrandomized, prospective, observational analysis included 77 patients 
      with chronic hepatitis B who were assigned to continue ETV or switch TAF. After 
      240 weeks, the mean changes in serum hepatitis B surface antigen (- 0.365 ± 0.069 
      log IU/mL vs. 0.301 ± 0.039 log IU/mL, p = 0.39) and hepatitis B core-related 
      antigen (- 0.215 ± 0.092 log IU/mL vs. - 0.195 ± 0.056 log IU/mL) were not 
      significantly different between the ETV and TAF groups. There were also no 
      differences between the two groups in estimated glomerular filtration rate (- 
      5.407 ± 1.660 vs. - 2.666 ± 1.52, p = 0.240), urinary β2-microglobulin 
      β/creatinine (ETV: 2.330 ± 0.374 at baseline and 2.335 ± 0.257 at 240 weeks; TAF: 
      2.720 ± 0.073 and 2.123 ± 0.310, p = 0.996 and 0.455, respectively) or urinary 
      N-acetyl-β-D-glucosaminidase/creatinine (ETV: 0.040 ± 0.005 at baseline and 
      0.044 ± 0.004 at 240 weeks; TAF: 0.049 ± 0.005 and 0.053 ± 0.005, p = 0.642 and 
      0.684, respectively). Finally, no significant difference was found in the 
      incidence of HCC between the ETV and TAF groups (log-rank test, p = 0.08). In 
      conclusion, the long-term observation of this study demonstrated that ETV and TAF 
      have comparable efficacy and safety.Clinical trial registration: UMIN000026465.
