0,Four-year overall survival update from the phase III HIMALAYA study of tremelimumab plus durvalumab in unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma.,10.1016/j.annonc.2024.02.005,"BACKGROUND: In the phase III HIMALAYA study (NCT03298451) in unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (uHCC), STRIDE (Single Tremelimumab Regular Interval Durvalumab) significantly improved overall survival (OS) versus sorafenib; durvalumab monotherapy was noninferior to sorafenib for OS. Results reported herein are from a 4-year updated OS analysis of HIMALAYA. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Participants with uHCC and no previous systemic treatment were randomized to STRIDE (n = 393), durvalumab (n = 389), or sorafenib (n = 389). The updated data cut-off was 23 January 2023. OS and serious adverse events (AEs) were assessed. Additionally, baseline characteristics and subsequent therapies were analyzed in long-term survivors (≥36 months beyond randomization). RESULTS: For STRIDE, durvalumab, and sorafenib, median [95% confidence interval (CI)] follow-up was 49.12 months (46.95-50.17 months), 48.46 months (46.82-49.81 months), and 47.31 months (45.08-49.15 months), respectively. OS hazard ratio (95% CI) for STRIDE versus sorafenib was 0.78 (0.67-0.92). The 36-month OS rate for STRIDE was 30.7% versus 19.8% for sorafenib. The 48-month OS rate remained higher for STRIDE at 25.2%, versus 15.1% for sorafenib. The long-term OS benefit of STRIDE was observed across clinically relevant subgroups and was further improved in participants who achieved disease control. Long-term survivors with STRIDE (n = 103) included participants across clinically relevant subgroups, and 57.3% (59/103) had no reported subsequent anticancer therapy. No new serious treatment-related AEs occurred with STRIDE from the primary analysis (17.5%; 68/388). Durvalumab maintained OS noninferiority to sorafenib and no late-onset safety signals were identified. CONCLUSIONS: These data represent the longest follow-up to date in phase III studies in uHCC. The unprecedented 3- and 4-year OS rates reinforce the sustained long-term OS benefit of STRIDE versus sorafenib. STRIDE maintained a tolerable yet differentiated safety profile from other current uHCC therapies. Results continue to support the long-term benefits of STRIDE in a diverse population, reflective of uHCC globally.",Sangro B; Chan SL; Kelley RK; Lau G; Kudo M; Sukeepaisarnjaroen W; Yarchoan M; De Toni EN; Furuse J; Kang YK; Galle PR; Rimassa L; Heurgué A; Tam VC; Van Dao T; Thungappa SC; Breder V; Ostapenko Y; Reig M; Makowsky M; Paskow MJ; Gupta C; Kurland JF; Negro A; Abou-Alfa GK,True,patients with unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma,STRIDE (Single Tremelimumab Regular Interval Durvalumab),sorafenib,overall survival,randomized controlled trial,"Matches all PICOS criteria: population with hepatocellular carcinoma, immunotherapy intervention, comparison with standard therapy, outcome of survival, and randomized controlled trial design.",True,-,-,-,-,-,"The analysis is accurate.

1,"Camrelizumab plus rivoceranib versus sorafenib as first-line therapy for unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (CARES-310): a randomised, open-label, international phase 3 study.",10.1016/S0140-6736(23)00961-3,"BACKGROUND: Immunotherapy with immune checkpoint inhibitors combined with an anti-angiogenic tyrosine-kinase inhibitor (TKI) has been shown to improve overall survival versus anti-angiogenic therapy alone in advanced solid tumours, but not in hepatocellular carcinoma. Therefore, a clinical study was conducted to compare the efficacy and safety of the anti-PD-1 antibody camrelizumab plus the VEGFR2-targeted TKI rivoceranib (also known as apatinib) versus sorafenib as first-line treatment for unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma. METHODS: This randomised, open-label, international phase 3 trial (CARES-310) was done at 95 study sites across 13 countries and regions worldwide. Patients with unresectable or metastatic hepatocellular carcinoma who had not previously received any systemic treatment were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive either camrelizumab 200 mg intravenously every 2 weeks plus rivoceranib 250 mg orally once daily or sorafenib 400 mg orally twice daily. Randomisation was done via a centralised interactive response system. The primary endpoints were progression-free survival, as assessed by the blinded independent review committee per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumours version 1.1, and overall survival in the intention-to-treat population. Safety was assessed in all patients who received at least one dose of the study drugs. We report the findings from the prespecified primary analysis for progression-free survival and interim analysis for overall survival. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT03764293). FINDINGS: Between June 28, 2019, and March 24, 2021, 543 patients were randomly assigned to the camrelizumab-rivoceranib (n=272) or sorafenib (n=271) group. At the primary analysis for progression-free survival (May 10, 2021), median follow-up was 7·8 months (IQR 4·1-10·6). Median progression-free survival was significantly improved with camrelizumab-rivoceranib versus sorafenib (5·6 months [95% CI 5·5-6·3] vs 3·7 months [2·8-3·7]; hazard ratio [HR] 0·52 [95% CI 0·41-0·65]; one-sided p<0·0001). At the interim analysis for overall survival (Feb 8, 2022), median follow-up was 14·5 months (IQR 9·1-18·7). Median overall survival was significantly extended with camrelizumab-rivoceranib versus sorafenib (22·1 months [95% CI 19·1-27·2] vs 15·2 months [13·0-18·5]; HR 0·62 [95% CI 0·49-0·80]; one-sided p<0·0001). The most common grade 3 or 4 treatment-related adverse events were hypertension (102 [38%] of 272 patients in the camrelizumab-rivoceranib group vs 40 [15%] of 269 patients in the sorafenib group), palmar-plantar erythrodysaesthesia syndrome (33 [12%] vs 41 [15%]), increased aspartate aminotransferase (45 [17%] vs 14 [5%]), and increased alanine aminotransferase (35 [13%] vs eight [3%]). Treatment-related serious adverse events were reported in 66 (24%) patients in the camrelizumab-rivoceranib group and 16 (6%) in the sorafenib group. Treatment-related death occurred in two patients: one patient in the camrelizumab-rivoceranib group (ie, multiple organ dysfunction syndrome) and one patient in the sorafenib group (ie, respiratory failure and circulatory collapse). INTERPRETATION: Camrelizumab plus rivoceranib showed a statistically significant and clinically meaningful benefit in progression-free survival and overall survival compared with sorafenib for patients with unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma, presenting as a new and effective first-line treatment option for this population.

2,"Nivolumab in patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (CheckMate 040): an open-label, non-comparative, phase 1/2 dose escalation and expansion trial.",10.1016/S0140-6736(17)31046-2,"BACKGROUND: For patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma, sorafenib is the only approved drug worldwide, and outcomes remain poor. We aimed to assess the safety and efficacy of nivolumab, a programmed cell death protein-1 (PD-1) immune checkpoint inhibitor, in patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma with or without chronic viral hepatitis. METHODS: We did a phase 1/2, open-label, non-comparative, dose escalation and expansion trial (CheckMate 040) of nivolumab in adults (≥18 years) with histologically confirmed advanced hepatocellular carcinoma with or without hepatitis C or B (HCV or HBV) infection. Previous sorafenib treatment was allowed. A dose-escalation phase was conducted at seven hospitals or academic centres in four countries or territories (USA, Spain, Hong Kong, and Singapore) and a dose-expansion phase was conducted at an additional 39 sites in 11 countries (Canada, UK, Germany, Italy, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan). At screening, eligible patients had Child-Pugh scores of 7 or less (Child-Pugh A or B7) for the dose-escalation phase and 6 or less (Child-Pugh A) for the dose-expansion phase, and an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 1 or less. Patients with HBV infection had to be receiving effective antiviral therapy (viral load <100 IU/mL); antiviral therapy was not required for patients with HCV infection. We excluded patients previously treated with an agent targeting T-cell costimulation or checkpoint pathways. Patients received intravenous nivolumab 0·1-10 mg/kg every 2 weeks in the dose-escalation phase (3+3 design). Nivolumab 3 mg/kg was given every 2 weeks in the dose-expansion phase to patients in four cohorts: sorafenib untreated or intolerant without viral hepatitis, sorafenib progressor without viral hepatitis, HCV infected, and HBV infected. Primary endpoints were safety and tolerability for the escalation phase and objective response rate (Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors version 1.1) for the expansion phase. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01658878. FINDINGS: Between Nov 26, 2012, and Aug 8, 2016, 262 eligible patients were treated (48 patients in the dose-escalation phase and 214 in the dose-expansion phase). 202 (77%) of 262 patients have completed treatment and follow-up is ongoing. During dose escalation, nivolumab showed a manageable safety profile, including acceptable tolerability. In this phase, 46 (96%) of 48 patients discontinued treatment, 42 (88%) due to disease progression. Incidence of treatment-related adverse events did not seem to be associated with dose and no maximum tolerated dose was reached. 12 (25%) of 48 patients had grade 3/4 treatment-related adverse events. Three (6%) patients had treatment-related serious adverse events (pemphigoid, adrenal insufficiency, liver disorder). 30 (63%) of 48 patients in the dose-escalation phase died (not determined to be related to nivolumab therapy). Nivolumab 3 mg/kg was chosen for dose expansion. The objective response rate was 20% (95% CI 15-26) in patients treated with nivolumab 3 mg/kg in the dose-expansion phase and 15% (95% CI 6-28) in the dose-escalation phase. INTERPRETATION: Nivolumab had a manageable safety profile and no new signals were observed in patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma. Durable objective responses show the potential of nivolumab for treatment of advanced hepatocellular carcinoma.

3,"Safety and antitumour activity of cadonilimab, an anti-PD-1/CTLA-4 bispecific antibody, for patients with advanced solid tumours (COMPASSION-03): a multicentre, open-label, phase 1b/2 trial.",10.1016/S1470-2045(23)00411-4,"BACKGROUND: Immune checkpoint inhibitors targeting PD-1 or CTLA-4 individually have shown substantial clinical benefits in the treatment of malignancies. We aimed to assess the safety and antitumour activity of cadonilimab monotherapy, a bispecific PD-1/CTLA-4 antibody, in patients with advanced solid tumours. METHODS: This multicentre, open-label, phase 1b/2 trial was conducted across 30 hospitals in China. Patients aged 18 years or older with histologically or cytologically confirmed, unresectable advanced solid tumours, unsuccessful completion of at least one previous systemic therapy, and an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0 or 1 were eligible for inclusion. Patients who had previously received anti-PD-1, anti-PD-L1, or anti-CTLA-4 treatment were not eligible for inclusion. In the dose escalation phase of phase 1b, patients received intravenous cadonilimab at 6 mg/kg and 10 mg/kg every 2 weeks. In the dose expansion phase of phase 1b, cadonilimab at 6 mg/kg and a fixed dose of 450 mg were given intravenously every 2 weeks. In phase 2, cadonilimab at 6 mg/kg was administered intravenously every 2 weeks in three cohorts: patients with cervical cancer, oesophageal squamous cell carcinoma, and hepatocellular carcinoma. The primary endpoints were the safety of cadonilimab in phase 1b and objective response rate in phase 2, based on the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST), version 1.1. The safety analysis was done in all patients who received at least one dose of cadonilimab. Antitumour activity was assessed in the full analysis set for the cervical cancer cohort, and in all patients with measurable disease at baseline and who received at least one dose of cadonilimab in the oesophageal squamous cell carcinoma and hepatocellular carcinoma cohorts. The study is registered on ClinicalTrial.gov, NCT03852251, and closed to new participants; follow-up has been completed. FINDINGS: Between Jan 18, 2019, and Jan 8, 2021, 240 patients (83 [43 male and 40 female] in phase 1b and 157 in phase 2) were enrolled. Phase 2 enrolled 111 female patients with cervical cancer, 22 patients with oesophageal squamous cell carcinoma (15 male and seven female), and 24 patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (17 male and seven female). During dose escalation, no dose-limiting toxicities occurred. Grade 3-4 treatment-related adverse events occurred in 67 (28%) of 240 patients; the most frequent grade 3 or worse treatment-related adverse events were anaemia (seven [3%]), increased lipase (four [2%]), decreased bodyweight (three [1%]), decreased appetite (four [2%]), decreased neutrophil count (three [1%]), and infusion-related reaction (two [1%]). 17 (7%) patients discontinued treatment due to treatment-related adverse events. 54 (23%) of 240 patients reported serious treatment-related adverse events, including five patients who died (one due to myocardial infarction; cause unknown for four). In phase 2, in the cervical cancer cohort, with a median follow-up of 14·6 months (IQR 13·1-17·5), the objective response rate was 32·3% (32 of 99; 95% CI 23·3-42·5). In the oesophageal squamous cell carcinoma cohort, with a median follow-up of 17·9 months (IQR 4·0-15·1), the objective response rate was 18·2% (four of 22; 95% CI 5·2-40·3). In the hepatocellular carcinoma cohort, with a median follow-up of 19·6 months (IQR 8·7-19·8), the objective response rate was 16·7% (four of 24; 95% CI 4·7-37·4).

4,Immune signatures of checkpoint inhibitor-induced autoimmunity-A focus on neurotoxicity.,10.1093/neuonc/noad198,"BACKGROUND: Neurologic immune-related adverse events (irAE-n) are rare but severe toxicities of immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) treatment. To overcome diagnostic and therapeutic challenges, a better mechanistic understanding of irAE-n is paramount. METHODS: In this observational cohort study, we collected serum and peripheral blood samples from 34 consecutive cancer patients with irAE-n (during acute illness) and 49 cancer control patients without irAE-n (pre- and on-ICI treatment, n = 44 without high-grade irAEs, n = 5 with high-grade nonneurologic irAEs). Patients received either anti-programmed cell death protein (PD)-1 or anti-PD ligand-1 monotherapy or anti-PD-1/anti-cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated protein-4 combination therapy. Most common cancers were melanoma, lung cancer, and hepatocellular carcinoma. Peripheral blood immune profiling was performed using 48-marker single-cell mass cytometry and a multiplex cytokine assay. RESULTS: During acute illness, patients with irAE-n presented higher frequencies of cluster of differentiation (CD)8+ effector memory type (EM-)1 and central memory (CM) T cells compared to controls without irAEs. Multiorgan immunotoxicities (neurologic + nonneurologic) were associated with higher CD8+ EM1 T cell counts. While there were no B cell changes in the overall cohort, we detected a marked decrease of IgD- CD11c+ CD21low and IgD- CD24+ CD21high B cells in a subgroup of patients with autoantibody-positive irAE-n. We further identified signatures indicative of enhanced chemotaxis and inflammation in irAE-n patients and discovered C-X-C motif chemokine ligand (CXCL)10 as a promising marker to diagnose high-grade immunotoxicities such as irAE-n. CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrate profound and partly subgroup-specific immune cell dysregulation in irAE-n patients, which may guide future biomarker development and targeted treatment approaches.

5,Regorafenib plus nivolumab in unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma: the phase 2 RENOBATE trial.,10.1038/s41591-024-02824-y,"Regorafenib has anti-tumor activity in patients with unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (uHCC) with potential immunomodulatory effects, suggesting that its combination with immune checkpoint inhibitor may have clinically meaningful benefits in patients with uHCC. The multicenter, single-arm, phase 2 RENOBATE trial tested regorafenib-nivolumab as front-line treatment for uHCC. Forty-two patients received nivolumab 480 mg every 4 weeks and regorafenib 80 mg daily (3-weeks-on/1-week-off schedule). The primary endpoint was the investigator-assessed objective response rate (ORR) per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) version 1.1. The secondary endpoints included safety, progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS). ORR per RECIST version 1.1 was 31.0%, meeting the primary endpoint. The most common adverse events were palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia syndrome (38.1%), alopecia (26.2%) and skin rash (23.8%). Median PFS was 7.38 months. The 1-year OS rate was 80.5%, and the median OS was not reached. Exploratory single-cell RNA sequencing analyses of peripheral blood mononuclear cells showed that long-term responders exhibited T cell receptor repertoire diversification, enrichment of genes representing immunotherapy responsiveness in MKI67(+) proliferating CD8(+) T cells and a higher probability of M1-directed monocyte polarization.

6,Single-cell immune signature for detecting early-stage HCC and early assessing anti-PD-1 immunotherapy efficacy.,10.1136/jitc-2021-003133,"BACKGROUND: The early diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) can greatly improve patients' 5-year survival rate, and the early efficacy assessment is important for oncologists to harness the anti-programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) immunotherapy in patients with advanced HCC. The lack of effective predicting biomarkers not only leads to delayed detection of the disease but also results in ineffective immunotherapy and limited clinical survival benefit. METHODS: We exploited the single-cell approach (cytometry by time of flight (CyTOF)) to analyze peripheral blood mononuclear cells from multicohorts of human samples. Immune signatures for different stages of patients with HCC were systematically profiled and statistically compared. Furthermore, the dynamic changes of peripheral immune compositions for both first-line and second-line patients with HCC after anti-PD-1 monotherapy were also evaluated and systematically compared. RESULTS: We identified stage-specific immune signatures for HCC and constructed a logistic AdaBoost-SVM classifier based on these signatures. The classifier provided superior performance in predicting early-stage HCC over the commonly used serum alpha-fetoprotein level. We also revealed the treatment stage-specific immune signatures from peripheral blood and their dynamical changing patterns, all of which were integrated to achieve early discrimination of patients with non-durable benefit for both first-line and second-line anti-PD-1 monotherapies. CONCLUSIONS: Our newly identified single-cell peripheral immune signatures provide promising non-invasive biomarkers for early detection of HCC and early assessment for anti-PD-1 immunotherapy efficacy in patients with advanced HCC. These new findings can potentially facilitate early diagnosis and novel immunotherapy for patients with HCC in future practice and further guide the utility of CyTOF in clinical translation of cancer research.

7,"Lenvatinib plus anti-PD-1 antibodies as conversion therapy for patients with unresectable intermediate-advanced hepatocellular carcinoma: a single-arm, phase II trial.",10.1136/jitc-2023-007366,"BACKGROUND: Over 70% of the patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) are diagnosed at an advanced stage and lose the opportunity for radical surgery. Combination therapy of tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) and anti-programmed cell death protein-1 (PD-1) antibodies has achieved a high tumor response rate in both the first-line and second-line treatment of advanced HCC. However, few studies have prospectively evaluated whether TKIs plus anti-PD-1 antibodies could convert unresectable intermediate-advanced HCC into resectable disease. METHODS: This single-arm, phase II study enrolled systemic therapy-naïve adult patients with unresectable Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer stage B or C HCC. Patients received oral lenvatinib one time per day plus intravenous anti-PD-1 agents every 3 weeks (one cycle). Tumor response and resectability were evaluated before the fourth cycle, then every two cycles. The primary endpoint was conversion success rate by investigator assessment. Secondary endpoints included objective response rate (ORR) by independent imaging review (IIR) assessment per modified RECIST (mRECIST) and Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors, V.1.1 (RECIST 1.1), progression-free survival (PFS) and 12-month recurrence-free survival (RFS) rate by IIR per mRECIST, R0 resection rate, overall survival (OS), and safety. Biomarkers were assessed as exploratory objectives. RESULTS: Of the 56 eligible patients enrolled, 53 (94.6%) had macrovascular invasion, and 16 (28.6%) had extrahepatic metastasis. The median follow-up was 23.5 months. The primary endpoint showed a conversion success rate of 55.4% (31/56). ORR was 53.6% per mRECIST and 44.6% per RECIST 1.1. Median PFS was 8.9 months, and median OS was 23.9 months. Among the 31 successful conversion patients, 21 underwent surgery with an R0 resection rate of 85.7%, a pathological complete response rate of 38.1%, and a 12-month RFS rate of 47.6%. Grade ≥3 treatment-related adverse events were observed in 42.9% of patients. Tumor immune microenvironment analysis of pretreatment samples displayed significant enrichment of CD8(+) T cells (p=0.03) in responders versus non-responders. CONCLUSION: Lenvatinib plus anti-PD-1 antibodies demonstrate promising efficacy and tolerable safety as conversion therapy in unresectable HCC.

The COSMIC-312 trial assessed cabozantinib plus atezolizumab versus sorafenib as first-line systemic treatment for advanced hepatocellular carcinoma. METHODS: COSMIC-312 is an open-label, randomised, phase 3 trial that enrolled patients aged 18 years or older with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma not amenable to curative or locoregional therapy and previously untreated with systemic anticancer therapy at 178 centres in 32 countries. Patients with fibrolamellar carcinoma, sarcomatoid hepatocellular carcinoma, or combined hepatocellular cholangiocarcinoma were not eligible. Tumours involving major blood vessels, including the main portal vein, were permitted. Patients were required to have measurable disease per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors version 1.1 (RECIST 1.1), Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer stage B or C disease, an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0 or 1, adequate organ and marrow function, and Child-Pugh class A. Previous resection, tumour ablation, radiotherapy, or arterial chemotherapy was allowed if more than 28 days before randomisation. Patients were randomly assigned (2:1:1) via a web-based interactive response system to cabozantinib 40 mg orally once daily plus atezolizumab 1200 mg intravenously every 3 weeks, sorafenib 400 mg orally twice daily, or single-agent cabozantinib 60 mg orally once daily.

FINDINGS: Analyses at data cut-off (March 8, 2021) included the first 837 patients randomly assigned between Dec 7, 2018, and Aug 27, 2020, to combination treatment of cabozantinib plus atezolizumab (n=432), sorafenib (n=217), or single-agent cabozantinib (n=188). Median follow-up was 15·8 months (IQR 14·5-17·2) in the progression-free survival ITT population and 13·3 months (10·5-16·0) in the ITT population. Median progression-free survival was 6·8 months (99% CI 5·6-8·3) in the combination treatment group versus 4·2 months (2·8-7·0) in the sorafenib group (hazard ratio [HR] 0·63, 99% CI 0·44-0·91, p=0·0012). Median overall survival (interim analysis) was 15·4 months (96% CI 13·7-17·7) in the combination treatment group versus 15·5 months (12·1-not estimable) in the sorafenib group (HR 0·90, 96% CI 0·69-1·18; p=0·44). The most common grade 3 or 4 adverse events were alanine aminotransferase increase (38 [9%] of 429 patients in the combination treatment group vs six [3%] of 207 in the sorafenib group vs 12 [6%] of 188 in the single-agent cabozantinib group), hypertension (37 [9%] vs 17 [8%] vs 23 [12%]), aspartate aminotransferase increase (37 [9%] vs eight [4%] vs 18 [10%]), and palmar-plantar erythrodysaesthesia (35 [8%] vs 17 [8%] vs 16 [9%]); serious treatment-related adverse events occurred in 78 (18%) patients in the combination treatment group, 16 (8%) patients in the sorafenib group, and 24 (13%) in the single-agent cabozantinib group. Treatment-related grade 5 events occurred in six (1%) patients in the combination treatment group (encephalopathy, hepatic failure, drug-induced liver injury, oesophageal varices haemorrhage, multiple organ dysfunction syndrome, and tumour lysis syndrome), one (<1%) patient in the sorafenib group (general physical health deterioration), and one (<1%) patient in the single-agent cabozantinib group (gastrointestinal haemorrhage). INTERPRETATION: Cabozantinib plus atezolizumab might be a treatment option for select patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma, but additional studies are needed.

9,Uncoupling immune trajectories of response and adverse events from anti-PD-1 immunotherapy in hepatocellular carcinoma.,10.1016/j.jhep.2022.03.039,"BACKGROUND & AIMS: While immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) has shown promise in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), it is associated with modest response rates and immune-related adverse events (irAEs) are common. In this study, we aimed to decipher immune trajectories and mechanisms of response and/or irAEs in patients with HCC receiving anti-programmed cell death 1 (anti-PD-1) therapy. METHODS: Pre- and on-treatment peripheral blood samples (n = 60) obtained from 32 patients with HCC (Singapore cohort) were analysed by cytometry by time-of-flight and single-cell RNA sequencing, with flow cytometric validation in an independent Korean cohort (n = 29). Mechanistic validation was conducted by bulk RNA sequencing of 20 pre- and on-treatment tumour biopsies and using a murine HCC model treated with different immunotherapeutic combinations. RESULTS: Single-cell analyses identified CXCR3(+)CD8(+) effector memory T (T(EM)) cells and CD11c(+) antigen-presenting cells (APC) as associated with response (p = 0.0004 and 0.0255, respectively), progression-free survival (p = 0.00079 and 0.0015, respectively), and irAEs (p = 0.0034 and 0.0125, respectively) in anti-PD-1-treated patients with HCC. Type-1 conventional dendritic cells were identified as the specific APC associated with response, while 2 immunosuppressive CD14(+) myeloid clusters were linked to reduced irAEs. Further analyses of CXCR3(+)CD8(+) T(EM) cells showed cell-cell interactions specific to response vs. irAEs, from which the anti-PD-1 and anti-TNFR2 combination was harnessed to uncouple these effects, resulting in enhanced response without increased irAEs in a murine HCC model. CONCLUSIONS: This study identifies early predictors of clinical response to anti-PD-1 ICB in patients with HCC and offers mechanistic insights into the immune trajectories of these immune subsets at the interface between response and toxicity. We also propose a new combination immunotherapy for HCC to enhance response without exacerbating irAEs. CLINICAL TRIAL NUMBER: NCT03695952. LAY SUMMARY: Response rates to immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) treatment in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remain modest and adverse events are common.

Adjuvant immunotherapy is considered a promising avenue. This multicenter, open-label, randomized, controlled, phase 2 trial was conducted at six hospitals in China to assess the efficacy and safety of adjuvant sintilimab, a programmed cell death protein 1 inhibitor, in these patients. Eligible patients with HCC with MVI were randomized (1:1) into the sintilimab or active surveillance group. The sintilimab group received intravenous injections every 3 weeks for a total of eight cycles. The primary endpoint was recurrence-free survival (RFS) in the intention-to-treat population. Key secondary endpoints included overall survival (OS) and safety. From September 1, 2020, to April 23, 2022, a total of 198 eligible patients were randomly allocated to receive adjuvant sintilimab (n = 99) or undergo active surveillance (n = 99). After a median follow-up of 23.3 months, the trial met the prespecified endpoints. Sintilimab significantly prolonged RFS compared to active surveillance (median RFS, 27.7 versus 15.5 months; hazard ratio 0.534, 95% confidence interval 0.360-0.792; P = 0.002). Further follow-up is needed to confirm the difference in OS. In the sintilimab group, 12.4% of patients experienced grade 3 or 4 treatment-related adverse events, the most common of which were elevated alanine aminotransferase levels (5.2%) and anemia (4.1%).

We aimed to investigate the activity of sequential transarterial chemoembolisation (TACE) and stereotactic body radiotherapy followed by avelumab (an anti-PD-L1 drug) for locally advanced, unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma. METHODS: START-FIT was a single-arm, phase 2 trial in patients with locally advanced hepatocellular carcinoma who were not suitable for curative treatment, conducted in two hospitals in Hong Kong and one in Shenzhen, China. Eligible patients were those aged 18 years or older with an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status 0-1, Child-Pugh liver function score A5 to B7, tumour size of at least 5 cm, a maximum of three tumour lesions, and adequate hepatic, renal, and bone marrow function. Participants received TACE on day 1, followed by stereotactic body radiotherapy (27·5-40·0 Gy in five fractions) at day 28. Avelumab (10 mg/kg) was administered 14 days following stereotactic body radiotherapy and every 2 weeks thereafter. The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients deemed amenable to curative treatment, defined as those who had a sustained complete or partial treatment response for at least 2 months and if curative treatment could be performed (ie, resection, radiofrequency ablation, or transplantation), analysed by intention to treat. Safety was also analysed in the intention-to-treat population. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT03817736) and has been completed. FINDINGS: Between March 18, 2019, and Jan 27, 2021, 33 patients (32 [97%] men and one [3%] woman) were enrolled. The median sum of the largest diameters of lesions was 15·1 cm (IQR 8·3-14·9). 21 (64%) patients had macrovascular invasion (hepatic vein [n=13], branched portal vein [n=3], or both [n=5]). Median follow-up was 17·2 months (IQR 7·8-25·8). 18 (55%) patients were deemed amenable to curative treatment: four (12%) of 33 patients had curative treatment (resection [n=2] or radiofrequency ablation [n=2]), and 14 (42%) had a radiological complete response and opted for close surveillance. 11 (33%) of 33 patients had treatment-related adverse events that were grade 3 or worse. The most common treatment-related grade 3 or worse adverse event was transient increase in alanine aminotransferase or aspartate aminotransferase (five [15%]) after TACE. Five (15%) patients developed immune-related adverse events of grade 3 or worse (three had hepatitis, two had dermatitis).

12,Association of inflammatory biomarkers with clinical outcomes in nivolumab-treated patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma.,10.1016/j.jhep.2020.07.026,"BACKGROUND & AIMS: Nivolumab, a programmed death (PD)-1 (PD-1) inhibitor, led to durable responses, manageable safety, and increased survival in patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). In our retrospective analysis, we studied the immunobiology and potential associations between biomarkers and outcomes with nivolumab in HCC. METHODS: Fresh and archival tumour samples from dose-escalation and dose-expansion phases of the CheckMate 040 trial were analysed by immunohistochemistry and RNA sequencing to assess several inflammatory gene expression signatures, including CD274 (PD-ligand 1 [PD-L1]), CD8A, LAG3, and STAT1. Biomarkers were assessed for association with clinical outcomes (best overall response by blinded independent central review per RECIST v1.1 and overall survival [OS]). RESULTS: Complete or partial tumour responses were observed in PD-L1-positive and PD-L1-negative patients treated with nivolumab monotherapy. Median OS was 28.1 (95% CI 18.2-n.a.) vs. 16.6 months (95% CI 14.2-20.2) for patients with tumour PD-L1 ≥1% vs. <1% (p = 0.03). Increased CD3 and CD8 showed a non-significant trend towards improved OS (both p = 0.08), and macrophage markers were not associated with OS. Tumour PD-1 and PD-L1 expression were associated with improved OS (p = 0.05 and p = 0.03, respectively). An inflammatory gene signature consisting of 4 genes was associated with improved objective response rate (p = 0.05) and OS (p = 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: PD-1 and PD-L1 expression, biomarkers of inflammation, and inflammatory gene signatures trended with improved survival and response. While further confirmation within a larger phase III trial is needed to evaluate predictive value of these biomarkers, these exploratory analyses suggest that anti-tumour immune response may play a role in the treatment benefit of nivolumab in HCC. LAY SUMMARY: Certain tests may be used to provide a picture of how a tumour is escaping the immune system, allowing it to continue to grow and create more tumours. Therapies such as nivolumab are designed to help the immune system fight the tumour. These tests may be used to determine how effective such therapies will be in the treatment of advanced liver cancer. NCT NUMBER: NCT01658878. Elsevier B.V.

Nivolumab monotherapy demonstrated clinical benefit with an acceptable safety profile in patients with aHCC in the CheckMate 040 study. Five-year follow-up of the sorafenib-naive and sorafenib-experienced groups of CheckMate 040 is presented here. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients received nivolumab monotherapy at dose levels of 0.1-10.0 mg/kg (dose-escalation phase) or 3 mg/kg (dose-expansion phase) every 2 weeks until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Primary endpoints were safety and tolerability (dose escalation), and objective response rate (ORR) by blinded independent central review (BICR) and by investigator as per RECIST version 1.1 (dose expansion). RESULTS: Eighty sorafenib-naive and 154 sorafenib-experienced patients were treated. Minimum follow-up in both groups was 60 months. ORR as per BICR was 20% [95% confidence interval (CI) 12% to 30%] and 14% (95% CI 9% to 21%) in the sorafenib-naive and sorafenib-experienced groups, respectively. Responses occurred regardless of HCC etiology or baseline tumor cell programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression levels. Median overall survival (OS) was 26.6 months (95% CI 16.6-30.6 months) and 15.1 months (95% CI 13.0-18.2 months) in sorafenib-naive and sorafenib-experienced patients, respectively. The 3-year OS rates were 28% in the sorafenib-naive and 20% in the sorafenib-experienced groups; 5-year OS rates were 14% and 12%, respectively. No new safety signals were identified; grade 3/4 treatment-related adverse events were observed in 33% and 21% of patients in the sorafenib-naive and sorafenib-experienced groups, respectively. Biomarker analyses showed that baseline PD-L1 expression ≥1% was associated with higher ORR and longer OS compared with PD-L1 <1%. In the sorafenib-naive group, patients with OS ≥3 years exhibited higher baseline CD8 T-cell density compared with those with OS <1 year.

14,Camrelizumab (a PD-1 inhibitor) plus apatinib (an VEGFR-2 inhibitor) and hepatic artery infusion chemotherapy for hepatocellular carcinoma in Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer stage C (TRIPLET): a phase II study.,10.1038/s41392-023-01663-6,"Hepatic arterial infusion chemotherapy (HAIC) using a combination of oxaliplatin, fluorouracil, and leucovorin (FOLFOX) has shown promise for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients classified under Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC) stage C. In China, the combined therapy of camrelizumab and apatinib is now an approved first-line approach for inoperable HCC. This study (NCT04191889) evaluated the benefit of combining camrelizumab and apatinib with HAIC-FOLFOX for HCC patients in BCLC stage C. Eligible patients were given a maximum of six cycles of HAIC-FOLFOX, along with camrelizumab and apatinib, until either disease progression or intolerable toxicities emerged. The primary outcome measured was the objective response rate (ORR) based on the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) v1.1. Thirty-five patients were enrolled.

15,Tremelimumab in combination with ablation in patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma.,10.1016/j.jhep.2016.10.029,"BACKGROUND & AIMS: Tremelimumab is a fully human monoclonal antibody that binds to cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated protein 4 (CTLA-4) on the surface of activated T lymphocytes. Ablative therapies induce a peripheral immune response which may enhance the effect of anti-CTLA4 treatment in patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). This study aimed to demonstrate whether tremelimumab could be combined safely and feasibly with ablation. METHODS: Thirty-two patients with HCC were enrolled: male:female: 28:4; median age: 62 (range 36-76). Patients were given tremelimumab at two dose levels (3.5 and 10mg/kg i.v.) every 4weeks for 6 doses, followed by 3-monthly infusions until off-treatment criteria were met. On day 36, patients underwent subtotal radiofrequency ablation or chemoablation. Staging was performed by contrast-enhanced CT or MRI scan every 8weeks. RESULTS: No dose-limiting toxicities were encountered. The most common toxicity was pruritus. Of the 19 evaluable patients, five (26.3%; 95% CI: 9.1-51.2%) achieved a confirmed partial response. Twelve of 14 patients with quantifiable HCV experienced a marked reduction in viral load. Six-week tumor biopsies showed a clear increase in CD8(+) T cells in patients showing a clinical benefit only. Six and 12-month probabilities of tumor progression free survival for this refractory HCC population were 57.1% and 33.1% respectively, with median time to tumor progression of 7.4months (95% CI 4.7 to 19.4months). Median overall survival was 12.3months (95% CI 9.3 to 15.4months). CONCLUSIONS: Tremelimumab in combination with tumor ablation is a potential new treatment for patients with advanced HCC, and leads to the accumulation of intratumoral CD8(+) T cells. Positive clinical activity was seen, with a possible surrogate reduction in HCV viral load. LAY SUMMARY: Studies have shown that the killing of tumors by direct methods (known as ablation) can result in the immune system being activated or switched on. The immune system could potentially also recognize and kill the cancer that is left behind. There are new drugs available known as immune checkpoint inhibitors which could enhance this effect. Here, we test one of these drugs (tremelimumab) together with ablation.

16,Upregulation of C/EBPα Inhibits Suppressive Activity of Myeloid Cells and Potentiates Antitumor Response in Mice and Patients with Cancer.,10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-21-0986,"PURPOSE: To evaluate the mechanisms of how therapeutic upregulation of the transcription factor, CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein alpha (C/EBPα), prevents tumor progression in patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and in different mouse tumor models. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: We conducted a phase I trial in 36 patients with HCC (NCT02716012) who received sorafenib as part of their standard care, and were given therapeutic C/EBPα small activating RNA (saRNA; MTL-CEBPA) as either neoadjuvant or adjuvant treatment. In the preclinical setting, the effects of MTL-CEBPA were assessed in several mouse models, including BNL-1ME liver cancer, Lewis lung carcinoma (LLC), and colon adenocarcinoma (MC38). RESULTS: MTL-CEBPA treatment caused radiologic regression of tumors in 26.7% of HCC patients with an underlying viral etiology with 3 complete responders. MTL-CEBPA treatment in those patients caused a marked decrease in peripheral blood monocytic myeloid-derived suppressor cell (M-MDSC) numbers and an overall reduction in the numbers of protumoral M2 tumor-associated macrophages (TAM). Gene and protein analysis of patient leukocytes following treatment showed CEBPA activation affected regulation of factors involved in immune-suppressive activity. To corroborate this observation, treatment of all the mouse tumor models with MTL-CEBPA led to a reversal in the suppressive activity of M-MDSCs and TAMs, but not polymorphonuclear MDSCs (PMN-MDSC). The antitumor effects of MTL-CEBPA in these tumor models showed dependency on T cells. This was accentuated when MTL-CEBPA was combined with checkpoint inhibitors or with PMN-MDSC-targeted immunotherapy. CONCLUSIONS: This report demonstrates that therapeutic upregulation of the transcription factor C/EBPα causes inactivation of immune-suppressive myeloid cells with potent antitumor responses across different tumor models and in cancer patients. MTL-CEBPA is currently being investigated in combination with pembrolizumab in a phase I/Ib multicenter clinical study (NCT04105335).",Hashimoto A; Sarker D; Reebye V; Jarvis S; Sodergren MH; Kossenkov A; Sanseviero E; Raulf N; Vasara J; Andrikakou P; Meyer T; Huang KW; Plummer R; Chee CE; Spalding D; Pai M; Khan S; Pinato DJ; Sharma R; Basu B; Palmer D; Ma YT; Evans J; Habib R; Martirosyan A; Elasri N; Reynaud A; Rossi JJ; Cobbold M; Habib NA; Gabrilovich DI,False,patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma,MTL-CEBPA,not specified,tumor regression,phase I trial,Does not match: lacks a comparison group and study design is not RCT.,False,-,-,not specified,-,phase I trial,Phase I trial without a comparison group.

17,Multicentre phase II trial of cabozantinib in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma after immune checkpoint inhibitor treatment.,10.1016/j.jhep.2024.03.033,"BACKGROUND & AIMS: Prospective data on treatment after immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) therapy in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) are lacking. We conducted a phase II multicentre study on cabozantinib after ICI treatment in HCC. METHODS: This is an investigator-initiated, single-arm, clinical trial involving academic centres in Hong Kong and Korea. Key eligibility criteria included diagnosis of HCC, refractoriness to prior ICI-based treatment, and Child-Pugh A liver function. A maximum of two prior lines of therapy were allowed. All patients were commenced on cabozantinib at 60 mg/day. The primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS). RESULTS: Forty-seven patients were recruited from Oct 2020 to May 2022; 27 and 20 patients had received one and two prior therapies, respectively. Median follow-up was 11.2 months. The median PFS was 4.1 months (95% CI 3.3-5.3). The median overall survival (OS) was 9.9 months (95% CI 7.3-14.4), and the 1-year OS rate was 45.3%. Partial response and stable disease occurred in 3 (6.4%) and 36 (76.6%) patients, respectively. When used as a second-line treatment (n = 27), cabozantinib was associated with a median PFS and OS of 4.3 (95% CI 3.3-6.7) and 14.3 (95% CI 8.9-NR) months, respectively. The corresponding median PFS and OS were 4.3 (95% CI 3.3-11.0) and 14.3 (95% CI 9.0-NR) months, respectively, for those receiving ICI-based regimens with proven benefits (n = 17). The most common grade 3-4 treatment-related adverse event was thrombocytopenia (6.4%). The median dose of cabozantinib was 40 mg/day. The number of prior therapies was an independent prognosticator (one vs. two; hazard ratio = 0.37; p = 0.03). CONCLUSIONS: Cabozantinib demonstrated efficacy in patients who had received prior ICI regimens; survival data for second-line cabozantinib following first-line ICI regimens provide a reference for future clinical trial design. The number of prior lines of treatment may be considered a stratification factor in randomised studies. IMPACT AND IMPLICATIONS: Prospective data on systemic treatment following prior immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) therapy for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) are lacking. This phase II clinical trial provides efficacy and safety data on cabozantinib in patients who had received prior ICI-based treatment. Exploratory analyses showed that the performance of cabozantinib differed significantly when used as a second- or third-line treatment. The above data could be used as a reference for clinical practice and the design of future clinical trials on subsequent treatment lines following ICIs. GOV IDENTIFIER: NCT04588051. Elsevier B.V.

We aimed to study the safety and efficacy of sequential radioembolisation with yttrium-90-resin microspheres (Y90-radioembolisation) followed by nivolumab in patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma. METHODS: Patients with Child-Pugh A cirrhosis and advanced hepatocellular carcinoma not suitable for curative surgery were treated with Y90-radioembolisation followed by intravenous nivolumab 240 mg 21 days after Y90-radioembolisation and every 2 weeks thereafter. The primary endpoint, assessed in the per-protocol population, was the objective response rate, determined by RECIST version 1.1, defined as the proportion of patients with a confirmed complete or partial response observed for lesions both within and outside the Y90-radioembolisation field. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03033446 and has been completed. FINDINGS: 40 patients were enrolled, of whom 36 received Y90-radioembolisation followed by nivolumab. One (3%) patient had a complete response and ten (28%) had a partial response; the objective response rate was 30·6% (95% CI 16·4-48·1). The most common treatment-related adverse events of any grade were pruritus (18 [50%] of 36 patients) and maculopapular rash (13 [36%]). Two (6%) patients experienced grade 3-4 treatment-related adverse events: one patient had a grade 3 increase in alanine aminotransferase levels, grade 3 bilirubin increase, and grade 4 increase in aspartate aminotransferase levels, while the other had a grade 3 maculopapular rash. Five (14%) patients had a treatment-related serious adverse event (Steven-Johnson syndrome, hepatitis E infection, fever, liver abscesses, and ascites). INTERPRETATION: Y90-radioembolisation followed by nivolumab resulted in an encouraging objective response rate in patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma, although the activity observed was not as high as the study was powered for. This strategy should be further evaluated in patients with Barcelona Clinic Liver Clinic (BCLC) stage B hepatocellular carcinoma that is ineligible or refractory to transarterial chemoembolisation and patients with BCLC C disease without extrahepatic spread.

We aimed to assess the efficacy and safety of pembrolizumab in this patient population. METHODS: KEYNOTE-224 is a non-randomised, multicentre, open-label, phase 2 trial that is set in 47 medical centres and hospitals across ten countries. Eligible patients had pathologically confirmed hepatocellular carcinoma; had previously been treated with sorafenib and were either intolerant to this treatment or showed radiographic progression of their disease after treatment; an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0-1; adequate organ function, and were Child-Pugh class A. Participants received 200 mg pembrolizumab intravenously every 3 weeks for about 2 years or until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, patient withdrawal, or investigator decision. The primary endpoint was objective response, defined as the proportion of patients with complete or partial response in all patients who received at least one dose of pembrolizumab, which was radiologically confirmed by use of the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors version 1.1 by central review. Safety was also assessed in all treated patients. This trial is ongoing but closed to enrolment and is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov number NCT02702414. FINDINGS: Between June 7, 2016, and Feb 9, 2017, we screened 169 patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma, of whom 104 eligible patients were enrolled and treated. As of data cutoff on Feb 13, 2018, 17 (16%) patients were still receiving pembrolizumab. We recorded an objective response in 18 (17%; 95% CI 11-26) of 104 patients. The best overall responses were one (1%) complete and 17 (16%) partial responses; meanwhile, 46 (44%) patients had stable disease, 34 (33%) had progressive disease, and six (6%) patients who did not have a post-baseline assessment on the cutoff date were considered not to be assessable. Treatment-related adverse events occurred in 76 (73%) of 104 patients, which were serious in 16 (15%) patients. Grade 3 treatment-related events were reported in 25 (24%) of the 104 patients; the most common were increased aspartate aminotransferase concentration in seven (7%) patients, increased alanine aminotransferase concentration in four (4%) patients, and fatigue in four (4%) patients. One (1%) grade 4 treatment-related event of hyperbilirubinaemia occurred. One death associated with ulcerative oesophagitis was attributed to treatment. Immune-mediated hepatitis occurred in three (3%) patients, but there were no reported cases of viral flares. INTERPRETATION: Pembrolizumab was effective and tolerable in patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma who had previously been treated with sorafenib. These results indicate that pembrolizumab might be a treatment option for these patients.

Here, we present 5-year results from this cohort. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients were randomized 1 : 1 : 1 to arm A [nivolumab 1 mg/kg plus ipilimumab 3 mg/kg Q3W (four doses)] or arm B [nivolumab 3 mg/kg plus ipilimumab 1 mg/kg Q3W (four doses)], each followed by nivolumab 240 mg Q2W, or arm C (nivolumab 3 mg/kg Q2W plus ipilimumab 1 mg/kg Q6W). The primary objectives were safety, tolerability, investigator-assessed objective response rate (ORR), and duration of response (DOR) per RECIST version 1.1. RESULTS: A total of 148 patients were randomized across treatment arms. At 60-month minimum follow-up (62.6-month median follow-up), the ORR was 34% (n = 17), 27% (n = 13), and 29% (n = 14) in arms A, B, and C, respectively. The median DOR was 51.2 months [95% confidence interval (CI) 12.6 months-not estimable (NE)], 15.2 months (95% CI 7.1 months-NE), and 21.7 months (95% CI 4.2 months-NE), respectively. The median overall survival (OS) was 22.2 months (34/50; 95% CI 9.4-54.8 months) in arm A, 12.5 months (38/49; 95% CI 7.6-16.4 months) in arm B, and 12.7 months (40/49; 95% CI 7.4-30.5 months) in arm C; 60-month OS rates were 29%, 19%, and 21%, respectively. In an exploratory analysis of OS by response (6-month landmark), the median OS was meaningfully longer for responders versus nonresponders for all arms. No new safety signals were identified with longer follow-up. There were no new discontinuations due to immune-mediated adverse events since the primary analysis.

21,Liver Metastases and Immune Checkpoint Inhibitor Efficacy in Patients With Refractory Metastatic Colorectal Cancer: A Secondary Analysis of a Randomized Clinical Trial.,10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2023.46094,"IMPORTANCE: Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) have limited activity in microsatellite-stable (MSS) or mismatch repair-proficient (pMMR) colorectal cancer. Recent findings suggest the efficacy of ICIs may be modulated by the presence of liver metastases (LM). OBJECTIVE: To investigate the association between the presence of LM and ICI activity in advanced MSS colorectal cancer. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: In this secondary analysis of the Canadian Cancer Trials Group CO26 (CCTG CO.26) randomized clinical trial, patients with treatment-refractory colorectal cancer were randomized in a 2:1 fashion to durvalumab plus tremelimumab or best supportive care alone between August 10, 2016, and June 15, 2017. The primary end point was overall survival (OS) with 80% power and 2-sided α = .10. The median follow-up was 15.2 (0.2-22.0) months. In this post hoc analysis performed from February 11 to 14, 2022, subgroups were defined based on the presence or absence of LM and study treatments. INTERVENTION: Durvalumab plus tremelimumab or best supportive care. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Hazard ratios (HRs) and 90% CIs were calculated based on a stratified Cox proportional hazards regression model. Plasma tumor mutation burden at study entry was determined using a circulating tumor DNA assay. The primary end point of the study was OS, defined as the time from randomization to death due to any cause; secondary end points included progression-free survival (PFS) and disease control rate (DCR). RESULTS: Of 180 patients enrolled (median age, 65 [IQR, 36-87] years; 121 [67.2%] men; 19 [10.6%] Asian, 151 [83.9%] White, and 10 [5.6%] other race or ethnicity), LM were present in 127 (70.6%). For patients with LM, there was a higher proportion of male patients (94 of 127 [74.0%] vs 27 of 53 [50.9%]; P = .005), and the time from initial cancer diagnosis to study entry was shorter (median, 40 [range, 8-153] vs 56 [range, 14-181] months; P = .001). Plasma tumor mutation burden was significantly higher in patients with LM. Patients without LM had significantly improved PFS with durvalumab plus tremelimumab (HR, 0.54 [90% CI, 0.35-0.96]; P = .08; P = .02 for interaction). Disease control rate was 49% (90% CI, 36%-62%) in patients without LM treated with durvalumab plus tremelimumab, compared with 14% (90% CI, 6%-38%) in those with LM (odds ratio, 5.70 [90% CI, 1.46-22.25]; P = .03). On multivariable analysis, patients without LM had significantly improved OS and PFS compared with patients with LM. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this secondary analysis of the CCTG CO.26 study, the presence of LM was associated with worse outcomes for patients with advanced colorectal cancer. Patients without LM had improved PFS and higher DCR with durvalumab plus tremelimumab.

Targeting membranous phosphatidylserine may induce pro-inflammatory and -immune stimulating effects that enhance immunotherapy activity. This hypothesis was tested in a single-arm phase 2 trial evaluating frontline bavituximab, a phosphatidylserine targeting antibody, plus pembrolizumab (anti-PD-1) in patients with unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (NCT03519997). The primary endpoint was investigator-assessed objective response rate among evaluable patients, and secondary end points included progression-free survival, incidence of adverse events, overall survival, and duration of response. Among 28 evaluable patients, the confirmed response rate was 32.1%, which met the pre-specified endpoint, and the median progression-free survival was 6.3 months (95% CI, 1.3-11.3 months). Treatment related-adverse events of any grade occurred in 45.7% of patients, with grade 3 or greater adverse events in 14.3% of patients. Adverse events of any cause were observed in 33 patients (94.3%), with grade 3 or greater adverse events in 11 patients (31.4%). Prespecified exploratory analyses of baseline tumor specimens showed that a depletion of B cells, and the presence of fibrotic tissue and expression of immune checkpoints in stroma was associated with tumor response. These results suggest that targeting phosphatidylserine may lead to synergistic effects with PD-1 blockade without increasing toxicity rates, and future studies on this therapeutic strategy may be guided by biomarkers characterizing the pre-treatment tumor microenvironment.",Hsiehchen D; Beg MS; Kainthla R; Lohrey J; Kazmi SM; Khosama L; Maxwell MC; Kline H; Katz C; Hassan A; Kubota N; Siglinsky E; Pillai AK; Youssoufian H; Mockbee C; Culm K; Uhlik M; Benjamin L; Brekken RA; Ahn C; Singal AG; Zhu H; Hoshida Y; Yopp AC,False,patients with unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma,bavituximab plus pembrolizumab,not specified,"objective response rate, progression-free survival, overall survival, duration of response",single-arm phase 2 trial,Lacks comparison group and is not a randomized controlled trial.,False,-,-,-,-,-,"The study lacks a comparison group and is not a randomized controlled trial.

23,"Efficacy and safety of atezolizumab/bevacizumab in patients with HCC after prior systemic therapy: A global, observational study.",10.1097/HC9.0000000000000302,"BACKGROUND: Since the introduction of the combination treatment of anti-programmed death-ligand 1 antibody atezolizumab and anti-VEGF antibody bevacizumab (AB), median overall survival in HCC has drastically improved. However, evidence on the efficacy and safety of the novel treatment standard in patients with prior exposure to systemic treatment is scarce. The aim of this global, multicenter, observational study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of AB in patients after previous systemic therapy. METHODS: We screened our global, multicenter, prospectively maintained registry database for patients who received any systemic therapy before AB. The primary end point was overall survival; secondary end points were time-to-progression, progression-free survival, objective response rate, and safety (rate and severity of adverse events). RESULTS: Among 493 patients who received AB for unresectable HCC, 61 patients received prior systemic therapy and were included in this analysis. The median age of the study population was 66 years, with 91.8% males. Predominant risk factors for HCC were viral hepatitis (59%) and alcohol (23%). Overall survival for AB was 16.2 (95% CI, 14.5-17.9) months, time-to-progression and progression-free survival were 4.1 (95% CI, 1.5-6.6) and 3.1 (95% CI, 1.1-5.1) months, respectively. The objective response rate was 38.2% (7.3% with complete and 30.9% with partial response). Overall survival was not influenced by treatment line (2nd vs. >2nd) or previous systemic treatment modality (tyrosine kinase inhibitors vs. immune checkpoint inhibitors). Treatment-related adverse events of all grades according to Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events were documented in 42.6% of patients, with only 13.1% of grade ≥3, including one death.

This phase II trial was conducted to prospectively investigate the efficacy and safety of lenvatinib, sintilimab (a PD-1 inhibitor) plus TACE (Len-Sin-TACE) in patients with advanced stage HCC. METHODS: This was a single-arm phase II trial. Patients with BCLC stage C HCC were recruited. They received lenvatinib (bodyweight ≥60 kg, 12 mg; bodyweight <60 kg, 8 mg) orally once daily, sintilimab (200 mg) intravenously once every 3 weeks, and on demand TACE. The primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS) per mRECIST. RESULTS: Thirty patients were enrolled. The primary endpoint was met with a median PFS of 8.0 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 6.1-9.8) months per mRECIST, which was the same as that per RECIST 1.1.

25,Radiation Therapy With Combination Therapy of Immune Checkpoint Inhibitors and Antiangiogenic Therapy for Hepatocellular Carcinoma.,10.1016/j.ijrobp.2023.07.001,"PURPOSE: Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) combined with antiangiogenic therapy have limited efficacy in treating advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The synergistic effect of systemic therapy and radiation therapy (RT) might resolve this problem. We aimed to investigate the effect of RT on the treatment outcomes of ICIs and antiangiogenic combination therapy in patients with advanced-stage HCC. METHODS AND MATERIALS: This retrospective observational study analyzed the medical records of 194 patients with Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer stage C HCC who were admitted to our center from August 2018 to June 2022 and received ICIs combined with antiangiogenic therapy as the first-line treatment. Patients who were administered RT for tumor thrombus or symptomatic metastases within 8 weeks of the commencement of combination therapy were allocated to the RT group, whereas those who did not receive RT were assigned to the non-radiation therapy (NRT) group. Propensity score matching was used to mitigate selection bias. The primary endpoints were progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS). The secondary endpoints included objective response rate, disease control rate (DCR), local PFS, out-of-field PFS, and treatment-related adverse events. RESULTS: A total of 76 patients diagnosed with advanced-stage HCC and treated with ICIs and antiangiogenic therapy were included in the study, with 33 patients in the RT group and 43 patients in the non-RT group. After propensity score matching, 29 matched patient pairs were generated. The median follow-up was 15.5 months, and the RT sites were mainly located on the tumor thrombus (55.2%) and extrahepatic metastatic lesions (48.3%). The median PFS was 8.3 months (95% CI, 5.4-11.3) in the RT group and 4.2 months (95% CI, 3.4-5.0) in the NRT group (P < .001). The median OS was not reached in the RT group and was 9.7 months (95% CI, 4.1-15.3) in the NRT group (P = .002). The objective response rate was 75.9% (95% CI, 56.5-89.7) in the RT group and 24.1% (95% CI, 10.3-43.5) in the NRT group (P < .001). The DCR was 100% in the RT group and 75.9% (95% CI, 56.5-89.7) in the NRT group (P = .005). The median local PFS and out-of-field PFS were 13.2 months (95% CI, 6.3-20.1) and 10.8 months (95% CI, 7.0-14.7), respectively. RT was an independent prognostic factor for PFS (hazard ratio = 0.33; 95% CI, 0.17-0.64; P < .001) and OS (hazard ratio = 0.28; 95% CI, 0.11-0.68; P = .005), respectively. The rates of any grade treatment-related adverse events were similar between the 2 groups.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: NASIR-HCC is a single-arm, multicenter, open-label, phase 2 trial that recruited from 2017 to 2019 patients who were naïve to immunotherapy and had tumors in the BCLC B2 substage (single or multiple tumors beyond the up-to-7 rule), or unilobar tumors with segmental or lobar portal vein invasion (PVI); no extrahepatic spread; and preserved liver function. Patients received SIRT followed 3 weeks later by nivolumab (240 mg every 2 weeks) for up to 24 doses or until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Safety was the primary endpoint. Secondary objectives included objective response rate (ORR), time to progression (TTP), and overall survival (OS). RESULTS: 42 patients received SIRT (31 BCLC-B2, 11 with PVI) and were followed for a median of 22.2 months. 27 patients discontinued and 1 never received Nivolumab. 41 patients had any-grade adverse events (AE) and 21 had serious AEs (SAE). Treatment-related AEs and SAEs grade 3-4 occurred in 8 and 5 patients, respectively. Using RECIST 1.1 criteria, ORR reported by investigators was 41.5% (95% CI 26.3% to 57.9%). Four patients were downstaged to partial hepatectomy. Median TTP was 8.8 months (95% CI 7.0 to 10.5) and median OS was 20.9 months (95% CI 17.7 to 24.1).

SAFFRON-104 (NCT03941873) was a multicohort phase Ib/II study investigating sitravatinib with/without tislelizumab, an anti-programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) antibody, in patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) or gastric cancer/gastroesophageal junction cancer (GC/GEJC). METHODS: Eligible patients had histologically/cytologically confirmed advanced HCC or GC/GEJC. Phase I determined the recommended phase II dose (RP2D) of sitravatinib with/without tislelizumab. Phase II evaluated sitravatinib monotherapy in patients with pretreated HCC, and sitravatinib plus tislelizumab in anti-PD-(L)1-naïve or -treated HCC and anti-PD-(L)1-naïve GC/GEJC. Primary endpoints were safety/tolerability (phase I) and objective response rate (ORR) (phase II). RESULTS: At data cutoff (March 31, 2023), 111 patients were enrolled; 102 were efficacy-evaluable (median study follow-up 9.1 months [range: 0.7-36.9]). The RP2D of sitravatinib was determined as 120 mg orally once daily. In patients receiving sitravatinib monotherapy and sitravatinib in combination with tislelizumab, grade ≥ 3 treatment-related adverse events occurred in 14 (51.9%) and 42 (50.0%) patients, respectively. The ORR was 25% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 8.7-49.1) in patients with pretreated HCC receiving sitravatinib monotherapy. In patients receiving sitravatinib with tislelizumab, the ORR was 11.5% (95% CI 2.4-30.2) with anti-PD-(L)1-naïve HCC, 9.5% (95% CI 1.2-30.4) with anti-PD-(L)1-treated HCC, and 16.1% (95% CI 5.5-33.7) in patients with anti-PD-(L)1-naïve GC/GEJC.

28,Conversion surgery for initially unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma using lenvatinib combined with TACE plus PD-1 inhibitor: A real-world observational study.,10.1016/j.dld.2023.11.027,"BACKGROUND: Conversion therapy for initially unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (iuHCC) using lenvatinib combined with transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (TACE) plus a PD-1 inhibitor (LTP) has achieved promising results. However, further comparative research is necessary to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of conversion surgery (CS) for iuHCC. METHODS: Data for 32 consecutive patients with iuHCC receiving CS and 419 consecutive patients with resectable HCC receiving initial surgery (IS) between November 2019 and September 2022 were collected retrospectively. After propensity score matching (PSM), 65 patients were selected. RESULTS: Before matching, the CS group had longer EFS (not reached vs. 12.9 months, P < 0.001) and similar OS (not reached vs. not reached, P = 0.510) compared with the IS group. Similar results for EFS (P = 0.001) and OS (P = 0.190) were obtained after matching. The multivariable Cox model (HR = 0.231, 95% CI: 0.105-0.504; P < 0.001) and subgroup analyses confirmed that CS could improve EFS. The CS group had significantly lower incidence of microvascular invasion (MVI) than the IS group (3.1% vs. 50.4%, P < 0.001). Moreover, the two groups had similar safety profiles. CONCLUSIONS: CS is effective and safe for patients with iuHCC receiving LTP. LTP has the potential to reduce risk factors for postoperative recurrence, especially MVI, which may influence surgical decision-making. Elsevier Ltd.

29,A first-in-human phase 1/2 study of FGF401 and combination of FGF401 with spartalizumab in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma or biomarker-selected solid tumors.,10.1186/s13046-022-02383-5,"BACKGROUND: Deregulation of FGF19-FGFR4 signaling is found in several cancers, including hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), nominating it for therapeutic targeting. FGF401 is a potent, selective FGFR4 inhibitor with antitumor activity in preclinical models. This study was designed to determine the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D), characterize PK/PD, and evaluate the safety and efficacy of FGF401 alone and combined with the anti-PD-1 antibody, spartalizumab. METHODS: Patients with HCC or other FGFR4/KLB expressing tumors were enrolled. Dose-escalation was guided by a Bayesian model. Phase 2 dose-expansion enrolled patients with HCC from Asian countries (group1), non-Asian countries (group2), and patients with other solid tumors expressing FGFR4 and KLB (group3). FGF401 and spartalizumab combination was evaluated in patients with HCC. RESULTS: Seventy-four patients were treated in the phase I with single-agent FGF401 at 50 to 150 mg. FGF401 displayed favorable PK characteristics and no food effect when dosed with low-fat meals. The RP2D was established as 120 mg qd. Six of 70 patients experienced grade 3 dose-limiting toxicities: increase in transaminases (n = 4) or blood bilirubin (n = 2). In phase 2, 30 patients in group 1, 36 in group 2, and 20 in group 3 received FGF401. In total, 8 patients experienced objective responses (1 CR, 7 PR; 4 each in phase I and phase II, respectively). Frequent adverse events (AEs) were diarrhea (73.8%), increased AST (47.5%), and ALT (43.8%). Increase in levels of C4, total bile acid, and circulating FGF19, confirmed effective FGFR4 inhibition. Twelve patients received FGF401 plus spartalizumab. RP2D was established as FGF401 120 mg qd and spartalizumab 300 mg Q3W; 2 patients reported PR. CONCLUSIONS: At biologically active doses, FGF401 alone or combined with spartalizumab was safe in patients with FGFR4/KLB-positive tumors including HCC. Preliminary clinical efficacy was observed. Further clinical evaluation of FGF401 using a refined biomarker strategy is warranted.

30,Evaluation of the interest to combine a CD4 Th1-inducer cancer vaccine derived from telomerase and atezolizumab plus bevacizumab in unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma: a randomized non-comparative phase II study (TERTIO - PRODIGE 82).,10.1186/s12885-023-11065-0,"BACKGROUND: Several cancer immunotherapies that target the PD-L1/PD-1 pathway show promising clinical activity in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). However, the standard of care in first-line treatment with atezolizumab (anti-PD-L1 therapy) in combination with bevacizumab is associated with a limited objective response rate. Telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT) activation meets the criteria of oncogenic addiction in HCC and could be actionable therapeutic target and a relevant tumor antigen. Therefore we hypothesized that combining anti-PD-1/PD-L1 therapy with an anti-telomerase vaccine might be an attractive therapy in HCC. UCPVax is a therapeutic cancer vaccine composed of two separate peptides derived from telomerase (human TERT). UCPVax has been evaluated in a multicenter phase I/II study in non-small cell lung cancers and has demonstrated to be safe and immunogenic, and is under evaluation in combination with atezolizumab in a phase II clinical trial in tumors where telomerase reactivation contributes to an oncogene addiction (HPV(+) cancers). The aim of the TERTIO study is to determine the clinical interest and immunological efficacy of a treatment combining the CD4 helper T-inducer cancer anti-telomerase vaccine (UCPVax) with atezolizumab and bevacizumab in unresectable HCC in a multicenter randomized phase II study. METHODS: Patients with locally advanced, metastatic or unresectable HCC who have not previously received systemic anti-cancer treatment are eligible. The primary end point is the objective response rate at 6 months. Patients will be allocated to a treatment arm with a randomization 2:1. In both arms, patients will receive atezolizumab at fixed dose of 1200 mg IV infusion and bevacizumab at fixed dose of 15 mg/kg IV infusion, every 3 weeks, according to the standard of care. In the experimental arm, these treatments will be combined with the UCPVax vaccine at 0.5 mg subcutaneously. DISCUSSION: Combining anti-PD-1/PD-L1 therapy with an anti-telomerase vaccine gains serious consideration in HCC, in order to extend the clinical efficacy of anti-PD-1/PD-L1. Indeed, anti-cancer vaccines can induce tumor-specific T cell expansion and activation and therefore restore the cancer-immunity cycle in patients lacking pre-existing anti-tumor responses. Thus, there is a strong rational to combine immune checkpoint blockade therapy and anticancer vaccine (UCPVax) in order to activate antitumor T cell immunity and bypass the immunosuppression in the tumor microenvironment in HCC. This pivotal proof of concept study will evaluate the efficacy and safety of the combination of a CD4 Th1-inducer cancer vaccine derived from telomerase (UCPVax) and atezolizumab plus bevacizumab in unresectable HCC, as well as confirming their synergic mechanism, and settling the basis for a new combination for future clinical trials.

31,Adjuvant immunotherapy improves recurrence-free and overall survival following surgical resection for intermediate/advanced hepatocellular carcinoma a multicenter propensity matching analysis.,10.3389/fimmu.2023.1322233,"BACKGROUND & AIMS: The effectiveness of adjuvant immunotherapy to diminish recurrence and improve long-term prognosis following curative-intent surgical resection for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is of increased interest, especially among individuals at high risk of recurrence. The objective of the current study was to investigate the impact of adjuvant immunotherapy on long-term recurrence and survival after curative resection among patients with intermediate/advanced HCC. METHODS: Using a prospectively-collected multicenter database, patients who underwent curative-intent resection for Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC) stage B/C HCC were identified. Propensity score matching (PSM) analysis was used to compare recurrence-free survival (RFS) and overall survival (OS) between patients treated with and without adjuvant immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs). Multivariate Cox-regression analysis further identified independent factors of RFS and OS. RESULTS: Among the 627 enrolled patients, 109 patients (23.3%) received adjuvant immunotherapy. Most ICI-related adverse reactions were grading I-II. PSM analysis created 99 matched pairs of patients with comparable baseline characteristics between patients treated with and without adjuvant immunotherapy. In the PSM cohort, the median RFS (29.6 vs. 19.3 months, P=0.031) and OS (35.1 vs. 27.8 months, P=0.036) were better among patients who received adjuvant immunotherapy versus patients who did not. After adjustment for other confounding factors on multivariable analyzes, adjuvant immunotherapy remained independently associated with favorable RFS (HR: 0.630; 95% CI: 0.435-0.914; P=0.015) and OS (HR: 0.601; 95% CI: 0.401-0.898; P=0.013). Subgroup analyzes identified potentially prognostic benefits of adjuvant immunotherapy among patients with intermediate-stage and advanced-stage HCC. CONCLUSION: This real-world observational study demonstrated that adjuvant immunotherapy was associated with improved RFS and OS following curative-intent resection of intermediate/advanced HCC. Future randomized controlled trials are warranted to establish definitive evidence for this specific population at high risks of recurrence.

32,Treatment Patterns and Efficacy of Chemotherapy After Pembrolizumab in Advanced Urothelial Cancer-a Real-World Study in the pre-Antibody-Drug Conjugate Era.,10.1016/j.clgc.2023.05.008,"BACKGROUND: Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) have been established as a routine treatment in patients with metastatic urothelial cancer (mUC). However, there has been no standard of care after progression on ICIs. We investigated real-world treatment patterns and efficacy of chemotherapy (CHT) after pembrolizumab, in the era before introduction of maintenance avelumab and antibody-drug conjugates (ADC). PATIENTS AND METHODS: An observational, retrospective study was conducted at twelve Nordic centers. Patients with mUC were treated according to investigator´s choice of CHT after pembrolizumab. Primary endpoint was overall response (ORR) and disease control rate (DCR); secondary endpoints were progression-free (PFS) and overall survival (OS). RESULTS: In total, 102 patients were included whereof 23 patients received CHT after pembrolizumab as second line treatment (subcohort A) and 79 patients in third line (subcohort B). Platinum-gemcitabine combinations were the most common regimens in subcohort A, and vinflunine in subcohort B. The ORR and DCR were 36% and 47%, respectively. Presence of liver metastases was independently associated with lower ORR and DCR. The PFS and OS were 3.3 months and 7.7 months, respectively. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group Performance Status (ECOG PS) and number of previous cycles of pembrolizumab were found to be independent prognostic factors associated with OS. CONCLUSION: In a real-world setting, CHT showed clinically meaningful response rates and survival in mUC patients after progression with pembrolizumab.

Immune checkpoint inhibitors, camrelizumab combined with an anti-angiogenic tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) apatinib, have emerged as a first-line treatment option for patients with unresectable HCC, yet its neoadjuvant application in combination with transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) in HCC remains unexplored. Therefore, this study aims to investigate the efficacy and safety of sequential TACE, camrelizumab, and apatinib as a neoadjuvant therapy for single, huge HCC. METHODS: This multi-center, open-label randomized phase 3 trial will be conducted at 7 tertiary hospitals. Patients with single huge (≥ 10 cm in diameter), resectable HCC will be randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to arm of surgery alone or arm of neoadjuvant therapy followed by surgery. In the neoadjuvant therapy group, patients will receive TACE within 1 week after randomization, followed by camrelizumab (200 mg q2w, 4 cycles), along with apatinib (250 mg qd, 2 months). Patients will receive liver resection after neoadjuvant therapy unless the disease is assessed as progressive. The primary outcome is recurrence-free survival (RFS) at 1 year. The planned sample size of 60 patients will be calculated to permit the accumulation of sufficient RFS events in 1 year to achieve 80% power for the RFS primary endpoint. DISCUSSION: Synergistic effects provided by multimodality therapy of locoregional treatment, TKI, and anti-programmed cell death 1 inhibitor significantly improved overall survival for patients with unresectable HCC.

The combination of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) and antiangiogenic drugs, such as bevacizumab and tyrosine kinase inhibitors, has been recommended as first-line treatment for advanced HCC. However, two-thirds of patients did not benefit from this form of immunotherapy. Currently, data on the subsequent regimen for patients previously treated with ICIs are lacking. Studies have shown that the combination of radiotherapy (RT) and ICIs is a potentially effective second-line therapy for HCC. This study aims to assess the efficacy and safety of combined therapy with stereotactic body RT (SBRT), sintilimab and IBI305 (a biosimilar of bevacizumab) in patients with HCC following the progression of first-line ICI therapy. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: This study is an open-label, single-arm, single-centre, phase 2 trial of 21 patients with advanced HCC in whom previous ICI therapy has failed. Participants will receive approximately 30-40 Gy/5-8F SBRT, followed by 200 mg sintilimab and 15 mg/kg IBI305 intravenously every 3 weeks.

METHODS: In this phase 1b study, patients received AL2846, an antiangiogenic TKI with multiple targets (c-MET, VEGFR1, c-KIT, Axl, RET, KDR, and VEGFR3), in combination with an anti-PD-L1 antibody (TQB2450) until disease progression, intolerable toxicity, death, or discontinuation for any cause. The primary end points included overall response rate (ORR) and safety, with secondary end points encompassing progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), disease control rate (DCR), and duration of response. RESULTS: Between November 2021 and September 2022, 18 patients with ESCC and 15 patients with HCC, whose ORR was 11.1% (95% confidence interval [CI], 3.1%-32.8%) and 0%, respectively, were enrolled. Adverse events (AEs) of any grade and treatment-related AEs were documented in 32 patients (97.0%) and 31 patients (93.9%), respectively. Grade 3 or higher AEs were observed in 10 patients (30.3%), with vomiting (6.1%) and infectious pneumonia (9.1%) being the most prevalent. Median PFS and OS values were 3.22 months (95% CI, 1.35-5.68 months) and 5.98 months (95% CI, 3.71-8.87 months), respectively, in patients with ESCC, and 5.55 months (95% CI, 2.66 months to not evaluable [NE]) and 16.72 months (95% CI, 4.86 months to NE), respectively, in patients with HCC. The DCRs were 66.7% (95% CI, 43.75%-83.72%) in patients with ESCC and 73.3% (95% CI, 48.05%-89.10%) in patients with HCC.

39,Combined hepatocellular cholangiocarcinoma in hepatectomy specimens: A clinicopathologic analysis.,10.4103/ijpm.ijpm_357_22,"BACKGROUND: Combined hepatocellular-cholangiocarcinoma (cHCC-CCA) is an uncommon form of primary liver carcinoma. It is heterogenous in terms of morphology, immunohistochemistry, radiology, and clinical features; making it a challenging entity for diagnosis. AIMS: The purpose of the present study was to evaluate clinicopathological characteristics of patients with cHCC-CCA. SETTINGS AND DESIGN: Retrospective observational study. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The patients diagnosed with cHCC-CC were identified from hepatic surgical specimens and were evaluated. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: Survival was estimated as per Kaplan-Meier method. RESULTS: Out of six patients, five had undergone resection while one had liver transplant. Five were male and one was female and the mean age was 52 years. Tumor markers revealed raised serum alfa-fetoprotein and CA19.9 in four and three patients, respectively. Five of the liver specimens were cirrhotic. Diagnosis was predominantly based on tumor morphology. All cases were of Allen and Lisa type B and cHCC-CCA as per WHO (2019) classification. Stem cell features <5% were noted in two cases. Immunohistochemistry for programmed death 1/programmed death ligand 1 (PD1/PDL1) was negative in both the hepatocellular and cholangiocellular components in all six cases. Mismatch repair (MMR) protein expression was retained in two and deficient in four cases. The median follow-up after surgery was 21.3 months (range, 5-46.2 months). Five patients had intrahepatic and/or extrahepatic recurrence on follow-up after surgery. The median recurrence-free survival was estimated at 13.1 months (95% CI 5.67-20.6). Three patients had received salvage treatment. The median overall survival was estimated at 20 months (95% CI 0-45.3).

40,Interim efficacy and safety of PD-1 inhibitors in preventing recurrence of hepatocellular carcinoma after interventional therapy.,10.3389/fimmu.2022.1019772,"INTRODUCTION: Locoregional interventional therapy including transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (TACE) and ablation are the current standard of treatment for early-to-mid-stage hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). However, questions remain unanswered regarding the management of recurrence after locoregional treatment. PD-1 inhibitors can block inhibitory signals of T-cell activation and proliferation to reduce the recurrence. We conducted a single-arm phase 2 trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of PD-1 inhibitors following locoregional interventional therapy in HCC patients with high recurrence risk guided by our novel scoring system. METHODS: Patients enrolled initially treated by TACE combined with ablation, then willingly joined the experimental group. One month later, they received the anti-PD-1 adjuvant therapy (intravenous injection of 200 mg), which was repeated every 3 weeks for a total of 4 or 8 cycles. Within this same period, other patients were screened into the control group to match the experimental group by 1:1 based on the propensity score matching method (PSM). The primary endpoint was relapse-free survival (RFS). Secondary endpoints included overall survival (OS) recurrence modality, safety, and quality of life. RESULT: At the time of data cutoff, the median RFS of the control group was 7.0 months while the experimental group had not reached it. Moreover, the 1-year RFS rate was 73.3% in the experimental group and 46.7% in the control group, showing a significant difference (P =0.02). The rate of local tumor progression in the experimental group was clearly lower than that in the control group (P = 0.027). Benefits associated with anti-PD-1 adjuvant therapy were observed in patients with multiple tumors and tumor size ≤2cm. Univariate and multivariate analyses demonstrated that anti-PD-1 adjuvant therapy was an independent favorable prognostic factor for RFS in HCC patients. The most frequent AE observed in this study was RCCEP, and other AEs included diarrhea, hepatotoxicity, rash, pruritus, and fatigue. The incidence of GRADE ≥3 AE and withdrawal in this study was low with no deaths recorded. CONCLUSIONS: Interim analysis from the study suggest the addition of anti-PD-1 adjuvant therapy after TACE combined with ablation could significantly prolong RFS with controllable safety for early-to-mid-stage HCC patients with high recurrence risk.",Qiao W; Wang Q; Hu C; Zhang Y; Li J; Sun Y; Yuan C; Wang W; Liu B; Zhang Y,True,patients with hepatocellular carcinoma,PD-1 inhibitors,standard therapy,relapse-free survival,randomized controlled trial,"Matches all PICOS criteria: population is HCC patients, intervention is immunotherapy, comparison is standard therapy, outcome is survival, study design is RCT.",True,-,-,-,-,-,"The analysis is correct.

41,Virtual clinical trials of anti-PD-1 and anti-CTLA-4 immunotherapy in advanced hepatocellular carcinoma using a quantitative systems pharmacology model.,10.1136/jitc-2022-005414,"BACKGROUND: Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the most common form of primary liver cancer and is the third-leading cause of cancer-related death worldwide. Most patients with HCC are diagnosed at an advanced stage, and the median survival for patients with advanced HCC treated with modern systemic therapy is less than 2 years. This leaves the advanced stage patients with limited treatment options. Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) targeting programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) or its ligand, are widely used in the treatment of HCC and are associated with durable responses in a subset of patients. ICIs targeting cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated protein 4 (CTLA-4) also have clinical activity in HCC. Combination therapy of nivolumab (anti-PD-1) and ipilimumab (anti-CTLA-4) is the first treatment option for HCC to be approved by Food and Drug Administration that targets more than one immune checkpoints. METHODS: In this study, we used the framework of quantitative systems pharmacology (QSP) to perform a virtual clinical trial for nivolumab and ipilimumab in HCC patients. Our model incorporates detailed biological mechanisms of interactions of immune cells and cancer cells leading to antitumor response. To conduct virtual clinical trial, we generate virtual patient from a cohort of 5,000 proposed patients by extending recent algorithms from literature. The model was calibrated using the data of the clinical trial CheckMate 040 (ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT01658878). RESULTS: Retrospective analyses were performed for different immune checkpoint therapies as performed in CheckMate 040. Using machine learning approach, we predict the importance of potential biomarkers for immune blockade therapies. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first QSP model for HCC with ICIs and the predictions are consistent with clinically observed outcomes. This study demonstrates that using a mechanistic understanding of the underlying pathophysiology, QSP models can facilitate patient selection and design clinical trials with improved success. commercial re-use.

42,Five-year overall survival with ipilimumab and stereotactic ablative radiotherapy for metastatic disease.,10.1016/j.radonc.2023.109618,"PURPOSE: Ipilimumab plus stereotactic ablative radiotherapy (SABR) demonstrate satisfactory short-term clinical benefit and low toxicities in metastatic cancers. Here, we report the 5-year overall survival (OS) rates for patients with metastatic disease treated with this combined-modality therapy in a phase II trial (NCT02239900). METHODS AND MATERIALS: SABR was delivered to patients with metastatic lesions in the liver and lung either during the first dose (concurrent) or 1 week after the second dose (sequential) of ipilimumab (every 3 weeks for 4 cycles). SABR was administered to liver or lung metastases as 50 Gy in 4 fractions or 60 Gy in 10 fractions, considering the tumor location. The OS rates at 12, 36, and 60 months were estimated by the Kaplan-Meier method; subgroup analyses of progression-free survival (PFS) and OS by SABR-targeted lesions (liver/lung) were performed by log-rank tests. RESULTS: A total of 106 patients were enrolled in this long-term follow-up analysis. At the median follow-up time of 15.32 months (range, 0.97-82.13 months), the median PFS was 6.52 months (95% CI, 5.86-7.14) and the median OS was 15.32 months (95% CI,13.03-17.23). The 12-, 36-, and 60-month OS rates were 61%, 23%, and 15%, respectively. There was a significant difference in OS between cohorts (P = 0.039), with a stronger response observed in lung-treated subgroups. Patients who had received sequential fractions (50 Gy/4f) to the lung had improved OS compared to those who had received sequential fractions (18.29 vs 8.9 months, P = 0.043) to the liver. Subgroup analysis of SABR-targeted lesions showed that lung-targeted groups had significantly longer PFS (6.87 months vs. 5.63 months, P = 0.034) and OS (18.67 months vs. 13.63 months, P = 0.013) compared to liver-targeted groups. The sequence did not affect the outcomes of PFS and OS. Exploratory analyses showed that SABR-targeted lesions and smoking history comprised an independent risk factor for OS.

43,Cost-effectiveness of Pembrolizumab as a Second-Line Therapy for Hepatocellular Carcinoma.,10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2020.33761,"IMPORTANCE: Immune checkpoint inhibitors have been approved for use as a second-line therapy for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in patients who previously received sorafenib. Pembrolizumab has shown substantial antitumor activity and a favorable toxicity profile as a second-line treatment of HCC. However, considering the high cost of pembrolizumab, there is a need to assess its value by considering both the clinical efficacy and cost. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of pembrolizumab vs placebo as second-line therapy in patients with HCC from the US payer perspective. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: A Markov model was developed to compare the lifetime cost and efficacy of pembrolizumab as a second-line treatment of HCC with those of placebo using outcome data from the KEYNOTE-240 randomized placebo-controlled trial, which included 413 patients with advanced HCC previously treated with sorafenib and randomized patients to receive pembrolizumab plus best supportive care or placebo plus best supportive care in a 2:1 ratio. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Life-years, quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), lifetime costs, and incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) were estimated at a willingness-to-pay threshold of $150 000 per QALY. One-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed to account for the parameter of uncertainty. A cost-threshold analysis was also performed. The study was conducted from January 31 to July 29, 2020. RESULTS: The base-case model found that treatment with pembrolizumab was associated with increased overall cost by $47 057 and improved effectiveness by 0.138 QALYs compared with placebo, leading to an ICER of $340 409 per QALY. The model was most sensitive to the hazard ratio of overall survival (range, 0.61-1.00), health utility of placebo (range, 0.59-0.93), price of pembrolizumab (range, $5531-$8297), and price of postprogression therapies (range, $5596-$7944 for pembrolizumab and $4770-$7156 for placebo). The ICER of pembrolizumab was larger than $150 000 per QALY in most of the sensitivity and subgroup analyses. The price of pembrolizumab needed to be reduced by 57.7% to $2925 per cycle to achieve cost-effectiveness. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: The findings of this cost-effectiveness analysis suggest that, at its current price, pembrolizumab is not a cost-effective second-line therapy for HCC in the US, with a willingness-to-pay threshold of $150 000 per QALY.",Chiang CL; Chan SK; Lee SF; Wong IO; Choi HC,False,patients with hepatocellular carcinoma,pembrolizumab,placebo,cost-effectiveness,Markov model,"Population, intervention, and comparison match, but outcome and study design do not meet the criteria.",False,-,-,-,cost-effectiveness,Markov model,"The population, intervention, and comparison match, but the outcome and study design do not meet the criteria for a systematic review of RCTs.",,,False

METHODS: The phase 1 study involved phase 1a monotherapy dose-escalation (part 1) and phase 1b combination therapy dose escalation (part 2) and expansion (part 3). Various dosing schedules of CS1002 (0.3, 1, or 3 mg/kg every 3 weeks, or 3 mg/kg every 9 weeks) were evaluated with 200 mg CS1003 every 3 weeks in part 3. RESULTS: Parts 1, 2, and 3 included a total of 13, 18, and 61 patients, respectively. No dose-limiting toxicities or maximum tolerated doses were observed. Treatment-related adverse events (TRAEs) were reported in 30.8%, 83.3%, and 75.0% of patients in parts 1, 2, and 3, respectively. Grade ≥3 TRAEs were experienced by 15.4%, 50.0%, and 18.3% of patients in each part. Of 61 patients evaluable for efficacy, 23 (37.7%) achieved objective responses in multiple tumor types. Higher objective response rates were observed with conventional and high-dose CS1002 regimens (1 mg/kg every 3 weeks or 3 mg/kg every 9 weeks) compared to low-dose CS1002 (0.3 mg/kg every 3 weeks) in microsatellite instability-high/mismatch repair-deficient tumors, melanoma, and hepatocellular carcinoma (50.0% vs. 58.8%, 14.3% vs. 42.9%, and 0% vs. 16.7%). CONCLUSION: CS1002, as monotherapy, and in combination with CS1003, had a manageable safety profile across a broad dosing range. Promising antitumor activities were observed in patients with immune oncology (IO)-naive and IO-refractory tumors across CS1002 dose levels when combined with CS1003, supporting further evaluation of this treatment combination for solid tumors. PLAIN LANGUAGE SUMMARY: CS1002 is a human immunoglobulin (Ig) G1 monoclonal antibody that blocks the interaction of CTLA-4 with its ligands and increases T-cell activation/proliferation. CS1003, now named nofazinlimab, is a humanized, recombinant IgG4 monoclonal antibody that blocks the interaction between human PD-1 and its ligands. In this original article, we determined the safety profile of CS1002 as monotherapy and in combination with CS1003. Furthermore, we explored the antitumor activity of the combination in anti-programmed cell death protein (ligand)-1 (PD-[L]1)-naive microsatellite instability-high/mismatch repair-deficient (MSI-H/dMMR) pan tumors, and anti-PD-(L)1-refractory melanoma and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). CS1002 in combination with CS1003 had manageable safety profile across a broad dosing range and showed promising antitumor activities across CS1002 dose levels when combined with CS1003.

46,Monitoring Blood Immune Cells in Patients with Advanced Small Cell Lung Cancer Undergoing a Combined Immune Checkpoint Inhibitor/Chemotherapy.,10.3390/biom13020190,"In this exploratory prospective observational study on 40 small cell lung cancer (SCLC) patients treated with a combination of chemotherapy and immune checkpoint inhibitors, blood immune cells were characterized by multi-color flow cytometry at the baseline and at the third therapy cycle. The numbers of neutrophils and of T-, B-, and NK cells, as well as the frequency of HLA-DR(low) monocytes, 6-SulfoLacNAc (slan)+ non-classical monocytes and circulating dendritic cell (DC) subtypes were determined. The prognostic value of the parameters was evaluated by the patient's survival analysis with overall survival (OS) as the primary endpoint. In addition, blood cell parameters from SCLC patients were compared to those from non-SCLC (NSCLC). The global median OS of patients was 10.4 ± 1.1 months. Disease progression (15% of patients) correlated with a higher baseline neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio (NLR), more HLA-DR(low) monocytes, and lower NK cell and DC numbers. The risk factors for poor OS were the presence of brain/liver metastases, a baseline NLR ≥ 6.1, HLA-DR(low) monocytes ≥ 21% of monocytes, slan+ non-classical monocytes < 0.12%, and/or CD1c+ myeloid DC < 0.05% of leukocytes. Lymphocytic subpopulations did not correlate with OS. When comparing biomarkers in SCLC versus NSCLC, SCLC had a higher frequency of brain/liver metastases, a higher NLR, the lowest DC frequencies, and lower NK cell numbers. Brain/liver metastases had a substantial impact on the survival of SCLC patients. At the baseline, 45% of SCLC patients, but only 24% of NSCLC patients, had between three and five risk factors. A high basal NLR, a high frequency of HLA-DR(low) monocytes, and low levels of slan+ non-classical monocytes were associated with poor survival in all lung cancer histotypes.

This study examined the outcomes of HCC patients who received the combination in southern Taiwan. PATIENTS AND METHODS: All patients were enrolled from four hospitals in Taiwan. They received Bev-Ate therapy for unresectable HCC. RESULTS: Thirty-five patients were included; 28 (80%) had Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer stage C disease. Hepatitis etiology was chronic hepatitis B and C in 63% and 17% of patients, respectively. Eleven (31%) patients had received prior systemic treatment for unresectable HCC. The response rate was 51%, and the disease control rate was 72% for all patients. The median progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) was 5.2 and 22.2 months, respectively. For patients who received prior systemic treatment, the efficacy of Bev-Ate in terms of response rates was similar compared with those without prior systemic treatment. Patients who received lower doses of bevacizumab (<15 mg/kg per dose) had non-inferior PFS and OS compared with those receiving a standard dose of bevacizumab. The incidence of proteinuria of all grades (15.8%) was less common when lower doses of bevacizumab were used. CONCLUSION: Real world data from HCC patients in southern Taiwan disclosed that the efficacy outcomes of Bev-Ate treatment were generally consistent with those of clinical trials in other countries.

48,Progression patterns and therapeutic sequencing following immune checkpoint inhibition for hepatocellular carcinoma: An international observational study.,10.1111/liv.15502,"BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Different approaches are available after the progression of disease (PD) to immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), including the continuation of ICI, treatment switching to tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) and cessation of anticancer therapy. We sought to characterise the relationship between radiological patterns of progression and survival post-ICI, also appraising treatment strategies. METHODS: We screened 604 HCC patients treated with ICIs, including only those who experienced PD by data cut-off. We evaluated post-progression survival (PPS) according to the treatment strategy at PD and verified its relationship with radiological patterns of progression: intrahepatic growth (IHG), new intrahepatic lesion (NIH), extrahepatic growth (EHG), new extrahepatic lesion (NEH) and new vascular invasion (nVI). RESULTS: Of 604 patients, 364 (60.3%) experienced PD during observation. Median PPS was 5.3 months (95% CI: 4.4-6.9; 271 events). At the data cut-off, 165 patients (45%) received no post-progression anticancer therapy; 64 patients (17.6%) continued ICI beyond PD. IHG (HR 1.64 [95% CI: 1.21-2.22]; p = .0013) and nVI (HR 2.15 [95% CI: 1.38-3.35]; p = .0007) were associated with shorter PPS.

APPROACH AND RESULTS: Using a database of 387 patients who underwent hepatic resection for HCC, immunohistochemical staining of PD-L1, CD8, and CD34 was performed. Additionally, we undertook an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for soluble PD-L1.

The presence of tumor-infiltrating CD8-positive T cells was significantly correlated with longer OS (multivariate hazard ratio, 0.383; 95% CI, 0.274-0.537; P < 0.0001). Stratification based on PD-L1 expression in cancer cells and tumor-infiltrating CD8-positive T-cell status was also significantly associated with OS (log-rank, P < 0.0001). HCC with PD-L1-positive expression was significantly correlated with positivity for vessels that encapsulated tumor clusters. Serum PD-L1 levels were significantly higher in the group of patients who had PD-L1-positive expression than in the group of patients who had PD-L1-negative expression (P = 0.0158). CONCLUSIONS: PD-L1 expression in cancer cells was associated with a poor clinical outcome and vascular formation in patients with HCC. Additionally, the combination of PD-L1 expression with tumor-infiltrating CD8-positive T-cell status enabled further classification of patients based on their clinical outcome. Thus, PD-L1 expression in cancer cells and tumor-infiltrating CD8-positive T-cell status might serve as predictive tissue biomarkers.",Itoh S; Yoshizumi T; Yugawa K; Imai D; Yoshiya S; Takeishi K; Toshima T; Harada N; Ikegami T; Soejima Y; Kohashi K; Oda Y; Mori M,False,patients with hepatocellular carcinoma,not specified,not specified,overall survival,retrospective analysis,"Population and outcome match, but intervention, comparison, and study design do not meet the criteria.",False,-,not specified,not specified,-,retrospective analysis,"The population and outcome match, but the intervention, comparison, and study design do not meet the criteria for a systematic review of RCTs.",,,False
50,Concomitant Medications Alter Clinical Outcomes in Patients with Advanced Digestive Tract Cancer Receiving PD-1 Checkpoint Inhibitors Combined with Antiangiogenetic Agents.,10.1007/s12029-024-01095-7,"PURPOSE: Our study aimed to evaluate the impact of concomitant medications on the response and survival of patients with advanced digestive tract cancer receiving an immunotherapy-antiangiogenesis combination. METHODS: We conducted a three-center observational retrospective study of patients with advanced digestive tract cancer who received programmed death-1 (PD-1) inhibitors plus antiangiogenic agents between March 2019 and July 2022 in China. The patients had one of the three types of primary tumors: hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), colorectal cancer (CRC), and gastric cancer (GC). RESULTS: The study included 352 patients. The most frequently prescribed co-medications were nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) (46.3%), proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) (38.0%), systemic antibiotics (33.8%), and corticosteroids (30.1%). Probiotics had a direct correlation with a higher objective response rate (ORR) (OR 2.4, 95% CI 1.2 to 4.7, p = 0.013). Patients who received PPIs for gastritis/gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) (HR 0.7, 95% CI 0.5 to 1.0, p = 0.045), anticoagulants (HR 0.5, 95% CI 0.3 to 0.9, p = 0.009), and probiotics (HR 0.7, 95% CI 0.5 to 1.0, p = 0.034) had longer progression-free survival (PFS). Patients who received PPIs for gastritis/GERD (HR 0.6, 95% CI 0.4 to 0.9; p = 0.009) had longer overall survival (OS), while patients receiving opioids (HR 1.5, 95% CI 1.1 to 2.0, p = 0.010) had a significantly higher risk of death. CONCLUSION: Patients with advanced digestive tract cancer who were administered PPIs for gastritis/GERD indication, anticoagulants, or probiotics in combination with PD-1 inhibitors and antiangiogenic agents experienced improved clinical outcomes.

The few systemic treatment options available only moderately prolong survival. Isolated hepatic perfusion (IHP) with melphalan is a regional treatment option, but prospective efficacy and safety data are lacking. METHODS: In this multicenter, randomized, open-label, phase III trial, patients with previously untreated isolated liver metastases from uveal melanoma were randomly assigned to receive a one-time treatment with IHP with melphalan or best alternative care (control group). The primary end point was overall survival at 24 months. Here, we report the secondary outcomes of response according to RECIST 1.1 criteria, progression-free survival (PFS), hepatic PFS (hPFS), and safety. RESULTS: Ninety-three patients were randomly assigned, and 87 patients were assigned to either IHP (n = 43) or a control group receiving the investigator's choice of treatment (n = 44). In the control group, 49% received chemotherapy, 39% immune checkpoint inhibitors, and 9% locoregional treatment other than IHP. In an intention-to-treat analysis, the overall response rates (ORRs) were 40% versus 4.5% in the IHP and control groups, respectively (P < .0001). The median PFS was 7.4 months versus 3.3 months (P < .0001), with a hazard ratio of 0.21 (95% CI, 0.12 to 0.36), and the median hPFS was 9.1 months versus 3.3 months (P < .0001), both favoring the IHP arm. There were 11 treatment-related serious adverse events in the IHP group compared with seven in the control group. There was one treatment-related death in the IHP group.

52,Healthcare costs related to adverse events in hepatocellular carcinoma treatment: A retrospective observational claims study.,10.1002/cnr2.1504,"BACKGROUND: Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is an aggressive form of liver cancer with increasing incidence and mortality worldwide. For metastatic disease, systemic treatment is recommended. In addition to tumor characteristics, adverse events (AEs) may influence regimen choice. AIM: To analyze healthcare burden among patients with advanced HCC, by treatment type and AEs observed. METHODS: Included were adult commercial and Medicare Advantage enrollees with ≥2 non-diagnostic claims coded for HCC (the first setting the index date); ≥1 claim for systemic treatment of advanced/metastatic HCC; and continuous enrollment for a 6-month pre-index baseline period to ≥1 month post-index (follow-up). Patients were excluded by lack of systemic treatment; incomplete demographic information; pregnancy, liver transplant, other cancers during baseline or clinical trial participation. We describe patient characteristics, common AEs, overall survival, and healthcare burden in 2017 USD up to 12 months after initiation of tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) monotherapy; immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) monotherapy; or FOLFOX combination therapy. RESULTS: The analytic sample consisted of 322 patients (median age 65.8 years, 76% male) who had 12 months' (unless death occurred prior) available follow-up, with median follow-up of 9 months. Among these, 241 (75%) had TKI monotherapy, 23 (7%) had ICI monotherapy, and 58 had FOLFOX (18%) first-line treatment. Overall, patients had a high burden of AEs (mean 3.2), with the most prevalent being pain (75%), infection (39%), ascites (34%), and bleeding (29%). After adjusting for covariates, infection ($50 374), fever ($47 443), and diarrhea ($29 912) imposed the highest incremental annual costs versus patients without the AE. Up to 90% of costs were attributable to inpatient admissions, with 56% to 60% involving intensive care. Median 1-year survival was 32%.

53,Combining stereotactic body radiotherapy with camrelizumab for unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma: a single-arm trial.,10.1007/s12072-022-10396-7,"PURPOSE: Stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) may have significant immunomodulatory effects that enhance tumor response to immune checkpoint inhibitors. This phase 2 clinical trial was conducted to evaluate the safety and efficacy of combining palliative SBRT with camrelizumab (an anti-PD1 monoclonal antibody) in patients with unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (uHCC). METHODS: Patients with uHCC, Child-Pugh A/B liver function, and at least one measurable lesion were enrolled between April 2020 and August 2022. Patients were administered 200 mg camrelizumab intravenously from the first day of palliative SBRT and then every 3 weeks. Palliative SBRT was delivered daily over five fractions per week, with a dose range of 30-50 Gy. The primary endpoints were objective response rate (ORR) and safety. This trial was registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT04193696). RESULTS: Twenty-one patients were enrolled; the median radiation dose was 40 Gy, and the median number of cycles of camrelizumab was five. The ORR was 52.4%. After a median follow-up of 19.7 months, the median progression-free and overall survival were 5.8 and 14.2 months, respectively. The overall survival probability was 85.7% at 6 months, 76.2% at 9 months, and 59.9% at 12 months. All grade 3 treatment-related adverse events (TRAEs) occurred in five patients (23.8%) and were manageable. No grade 4/5 TRAEs were observed.

54,Ultrasound-Guided High-Intensity Focused Ultrasound Combined With PD-1 Blockade in Patients With Liver Metastases From Lung Cancer: Protocol for a Single-Arm Phase 2 Trial.,10.2196/59152,"BACKGROUND: While immunotherapy has revolutionized oncological management, its efficacy in lung cancer patients with liver metastases remains limited, potentially due to the unique immunosuppressive microenvironment of the liver. Local liver treatment has been shown to enhance the immunotherapy response, and high-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU), a minimally invasive local treatment, has demonstrated promising results in combination with immunotherapy. However, clinical data regarding HIFU in lung cancer with liver metastases are limited. OBJECTIVE: We designed the HILL (Ultrasound-Guided High-Intensity Focused Ultrasound Combined With PD-1 Blockade in Patients With Liver Metastases From Lung Cancer) study to investigate the effectiveness and safety of HIFU in combination with immunotherapy for lung cancer with liver metastases. METHODS: The HILL study is a single-armed, single-center, phase 2 clinical trial that will enroll 30 patients with lung cancer and liver metastases. The treatment regimen involves administering HIFU to liver metastases 1 week before the first dose of a programmed cell death protein (PD)-1 blockade, which is then administered every 3 weeks. The primary aim is to determine the overall response rate based on immune-related response criteria. Secondary aims include safety, progression-free survival, overall response, overall survival, and quality of life. Exploratory studies will also be conducted using whole blood, plasma, archival cancer tissue, and tumor biopsies during progression or relapse to identify potential biomarkers. RESULTS: The study was funded on March 14, 2022, and received ethical approval on April 27, 2022. Clinical trial registration was completed by June 10, 2022, with participant recruitment beginning on July 10, 2022. Data collection commenced on July 14, 2022, with the enrollment of the first patient. By April 2024, 6 participants had been recruited. The results are expected to be published in December 2026. CONCLUSIONS: This study seeks to improve treatment outcomes for lung cancer patients with liver metastases by combining HIFU and PD-1 inhibition. The study also aims to identify potential biomarkers through exploratory research that can aid in selecting patients for optimized outcomes in the future.

METHODS: We conducted the retrospective cohort study of 323 BCLC stage B or C hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients with Child-Pugh class A, and a performance status of 0 or 1 who started Atez/Bev from September 2020 to December 2021 at 22 institutions in Japan. Patients with viral infection was defined as those who were either serum anti-HCV- Ab or HBs-Ag-positive, while patients with non-viral infection was defined as those who were both serum anti-HCV Ab- and HBs-Ag-negative. We constructed a propensity-score-matched cohort to minimize the risk of observable potential confounders. RESULTS: Propensity score matching produced 126 matched pairs for patients with viral versus non-viral infection. After matching, the significant differences in baseline demographic features did not exist between the two groups. The objective response rate was 20.6% and 24.6% in viral- and non-viral-related HCC patients, respectively, without a significant difference (p = 0.55).

Eligible patients had unresectable BTC with 1 to 2 lines of prior therapy in the metastatic setting, measurable disease, and Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status less than or equal to 1. The primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS).RESULTSSeventy-seven patients were randomized and received study therapy. The trial met its primary endpoint, with a median PFS of 3.65 months in the combination arm versus 1.87 months in the monotherapy arm (HR 0.58, 90% CI 0.35-0.93, 1-tail P = 0.027). One patient in the combination arm (3.3%) and 1 patient in the monotherapy arm (2.8%) had a partial response. Combination therapy was associated with more rash, gastrointestinal events, CPK elevations, and thrombocytopenia. Exploratory analysis of tumor biopsies revealed enhanced expression of antigen processing and presentation genes and an increase in CD8/FoxP3 ratios with combination treatment.

We conducted this observational, retrospective, cohort study to compare the clinical outcomes and safety of transarterial chemoembolization combined with programmed cell death protein-1 inhibitors plus lenvatinib versus programmed cell death protein-1 inhibitors plus lenvatinib in patients with unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma. Methods: Between November 2019 and November 2021, patients who were diagnosed with unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma and received transarterial chemoembolization combined with programmed cell death protein-1 inhibitors plus lenvatinib or programmed cell death protein-1 inhibitors plus lenvatinib treatment were reviewed for eligibility. The primary endpoints included objective response rate, overall survival, and progression-free survival. The secondary endpoint was the frequency of key adverse events. Results: In total, 105 patients were eligible for the present study, and they were divided into the transarterial chemoembolization combined with programmed cell death protein-1 inhibitors plus lenvatinib group (n = 46) and the programmed cell death protein-1 inhibitors plus lenvatinib group (n = 59). The patient cohort after a one-to-one propensity score matching (n = 86) was also analyzed. The transarterial chemoembolization combined with programmed cell death protein-1 inhibitors plus lenvatinib group had a higher objective response rate both in the patient cohort before propensity score matching (54.3% vs 25.4%, P = .002) and after propensity score matching (55.8% vs 30.2%, P = .017). The patients in the transarterial chemoembolization combined with programmed cell death protein-1 inhibitors plus lenvatinib group had prolonged overall survival (median, 20.5 vs 12.6 months, P = .015) and progression-free survival (median, 10.2 vs 7.4 months, P = .035). For patient cohort- propensity score matching, the overall survival (20.5 vs 12.8 months, P = .013) and progression-free survival (12.1 vs 7.8 months, P = .030) were also significantly better in the transarterial chemoembolization combined with programmed cell death protein-1 inhibitors plus lenvatinib group than in the programmed cell death protein-1 inhibitors plus lenvatinib group. There were no significant differences between the 2 groups concerning adverse reactions caused by immunotherapy and lenvatinib. The adverse reactions caused by transarterial chemoembolization were transient and were quickly reversed.

Interim analysis was carried out at 6 months following first dose of the last enrolled patient in each cohort. Pharmacodynamic biomarkers were tested for CD38, PD-L1, tumor-infiltrating immune cells, and FOXP3+ regulatory T cells (Tregs) in the tumor microenvironment (TME). RESULTS: Overall, 107 patients were treated (EOC, n = 18; GBM, n = 33; HCC, n = 27; SCCHN, n = 29). In phase I, Isa + Atezo showed an acceptable safety profile, no dose-limiting toxicities were observed, and RP2D was confirmed. Most patients experienced ≥1 treatment-emergent adverse event (TEAE), with ≤48.5% being grade ≥3. The most frequent TEAE was infusion reactions. The study did not continue to stage 2 based on prespecified targets. Tumor-infiltrating CD38+ immune cells were reduced and almost cleared after treatment. Isa + Atezo did not significantly modulate Tregs or PD-L1 expression in the TME. CONCLUSIONS: Isa + Atezo had acceptable safety and tolerability. Clinical pharmacodynamic evaluation revealed efficient target engagement of isatuximab via treatment-mediated reduction of CD38+ immune cells in the TME.

Patients and Methods: A total of 63 uHCC patients were treated with this triple combination. Multivariate analyses to determine the independent factors associated with overall survival (OS) were employed. The link between NLR and clinical results was further analyzed. Furthermore, the predictive value of combining NLR with ETS should be investigated to stratify patients receiving treatment for survival benefits. Results: Progression-free survival and OS were 9.8 and 23.0 months, respectively, with a median follow-up of 20.8 months. On a multivariate analysis of OS, NLR was the only independent prognostic factor. Patients with NLR low (NLR < 3.2) had longer progression-free survival (19.3 vs 7.3 months, P < 0.001) and OS (28.9 vs 16.9 months, P < 0.001), higher objective response rate (86.7% vs 39.4%, P < 0.001), and a higher chance of achieving ETS ≥ 10% (ETS high) (73.3% vs 21.1%, P < 0.001) compared with patients with NLR high (NLR ≥ 3.2). The Spearman correlation analysis also showed the strong consistency between NLR and ETS (R(2) = 0.6751). In the subgroup analysis, greater OS benefit was found in the NLR low/ETS high group than the NLR high/ETS low group (χ(2) = 31.258, P < 0.001), while there was no survival difference for patients in the NLR low/ETS low group compared with in the NLR high/ETS high group (χ(2) = 0.046, P = 0.830).

63,Cabozantinib plus atezolizumab for the treatment of advanced hepatocellular carcinoma: shedding light on the preclinical rationale and clinical trials.,10.1080/13543784.2022.2032641,"INTRODUCTION: Combining multikinase inhibitors (MKIs) with immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) in advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) has a strong biological rationale. Among MKIs, cabozantinib seems an ideal partner for ICIs, playing a potentially synergistic role via a spectrum of immunomodulatory actions. AREA COVERED: This paper discusses the preclinical rationale for combining cabozantinib and atezolizumab in advanced HCC. It examines the mechanism of action of these agents and highlights their synergistic activities in vitro. Other MKI plus ICI combinations under investigation are evaluated. The results of the phase 1b COSMIC-021 study testing cabozantinib plus atezolizumab across numerous tumor types are presented along with the study design and the recent results of the phase 3 COSMIC-312 trial evaluating this combination as a front-line option for advanced HCC. EXPERT OPINION: The eventual approval of novel combinations for advanced HCC will require careful patient selection and a refinement of study design for future trials. Regarding the search for predictive biomarkers, etiology and extent of disease may predict response to therapy. Moving cabozantinib to first-line, treatment sequencing should consider possible cross-resistance not only to ICIs but also to other MKIs.

METHODS: This open-label, prospective, phase II study included patients with unresectable HCC who did not receive systematic treatment. The patients were treated with sintilimab (200 mg, intravenous drip, once every 3 weeks) combined with apatinib (250 mg, oral administration, once a day) plus capecitabine (1000 mg/m(2), twice a day; after 2 weeks of oral administration, the drug was stopped for 1 week; course of treatment, 3 weeks). The primary endpoint was the objective response rate (ORR). The secondary endpoints included disease control rate (DCR), progression-free survival (PFS), duration of response (DoR), overall survival (OS), and safety. RESULTS: Forty-seven patients (1 lost to follow-up) were enrolled in the study. As of March 1, 2022, the ORR and DCR were 50.0% (95% CI: 34.9-65.1%) and 91.3% (95% CI: 79.2-97.6%), respectively, after blind, independent imaging evaluation. The median follow-up time was 18.7 months (95% CI: 17.2-20.2 months). The median PFS was 9.0 months (95% CI: 7.1-10.9 months). The median DoR was 10.8 months (95% CI: 4.8-16.8 months). The median OS was not reached, and the 1-year OS rate was 71.7% (95% CI: 56.5-84.0%). Only 28.3% (13/46) of patients had grade 3/4 treatment-related adverse events.

66,A Non-interventional Clinical Trial Assessing Immune Responses After Radiofrequency Ablation of Liver Metastases From Colorectal Cancer.,10.3389/fimmu.2019.02526,"Background: Radiofrequency ablation (RFA) is an established treatment option for malignancies located in the liver. RFA-induced irreversible coagulation necrosis leads to the release of danger signals and cellular content. Hence, RFA may constitute an endogenous in situ tumor vaccination, stimulating innate and adaptive immune responses, including tumor-antigen specific T cells. This may explain a phenomenon termed abscopal effect, namely tumor regression in untreated lesions evidenced after distant thermal ablation or irradiation. In this study, we therefore assessed systemic and local immune responses in individual patients treated with RFA. Methods: For this prospective clinical trial, patients with liver metastasis from colorectal carcinoma (mCRC) receiving RFA and undergoing metachronous liver surgery for another lesion were recruited (n = 9) during a 5-year period. Tumor and non-malignant liver tissue samples from six patients were investigated by whole transcriptome sequencing and tandem-mass spectrometry, characterizing naturally presented HLA ligands. Tumor antigen-derived HLA-restricted peptides were selected by different predefined approaches. Further, candidate HLA ligands were manually curated. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells were stimulated in vitro with epitope candidate peptides, and functional T cell responses were assessed by intracellular cytokine staining. Immunohistochemical markers were additionally investigated in surgically resected mCRC from patients treated with (n = 9) or without RFA (n = 7). Results: In all six investigated patients, either induced immune responses and/or pre-existing T cell immunity against the selected targets were observed. Multi-cytokine responses were inter alia directed against known tumor antigens such as cyclin D1 but also against a (predicted) mutation contained in ERBB3. Immunohistochemistry did not show a relevant influx of immune cells into distant malignant lesions after RFA treatment (n = 9) as compared to the surgery only mCRC group (n = 7). Conclusions: Using an individualized approach for target selection, RFA induced and/or boosted T cell responses specific for individual tumor antigens were more frequently detectable as compared to previously published observations with well-characterized tumor antigens. However, the witnessed modest RFA-induced immunological effects alone may not be sufficient for the rejection of established tumors. Therefore, these findings warrant further clinical investigation including the assessment of RFA combination therapies e.g., with immune stimulatory agents, cancer vaccination, and/or immune checkpoint inhibitors.

67,Nivolumab in advanced hepatocellular carcinoma: Sorafenib-experienced Asian cohort analysis.,10.1016/j.jhep.2019.05.014,"BACKGROUND & AIMS: Nivolumab, an immune checkpoint inhibitor, is approved in several countries to treat sorafenib-experienced patients with HCC, based on results from the CheckMate 040 study (NCT01658878). Marked differences exist in HCC clinical presentation, aetiology, treatment patterns and outcomes across regions. This analysis assessed the safety and efficacy of nivolumab in the Asian cohort of CheckMate 040. METHODS: CheckMate 040 is an international, multicentre, open-label, phase I/II study of nivolumab in adults with advanced HCC, regardless of aetiology, not amenable to curative resection or local treatment and with/without previous sorafenib treatment. This analysis included all sorafenib-experienced patients in the intent-to-treat (ITT) overall population and Asian cohort. The analysis cut-off date was March 2018. RESULTS: There were 182 and 85 patients in the ITT population and Asian cohort, respectively. In both populations, most patients were older than 60 years, had BCLC (Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer) Stage C disease, and had received previous systemic therapy. A higher percentage of Asian patients had HBV infections, extrahepatic metastases and prior therapies. Median follow-up was 31.6 and 31.3 months for the ITT and Asian patients, respectively. Objective response rates were 14% and 15% in the ITT population and Asian cohort, respectively. In the Asian cohort, patients with HBV, HCV or those who were uninfected had objective response rates of 13%, 14% and 21%, respectively. The median duration of response was longer in the ITT (19.4 months) vs. Asian patients (9.7 months). Median overall survival was similar between the ITT (15.1 months) and Asian patients (14.9 months), and unaffected by aetiology in Asian patients. The nivolumab safety profile was similar and manageable across both populations. CONCLUSION: Nivolumab safety and efficacy are comparable between sorafenib-experienced ITT and Asian patients. LAY SUMMARY: The CheckMate 040 study evaluated the safety and efficacy of nivolumab in patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma who were refractory to previous sorafenib treatment or chemotherapy. This subanalysis of the data showed that treatment responses and safety in patients in Asia were similar to those of the overall treatment population, providing support for nivolumab as a treatment option for these patients.

Nofazinlimab is a humanized rat antibody targeting PD-1. A first-in-human study of nofazinlimab conducted in Australia found no dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) and the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) was not reached in the range of 1-10 mg/kg. OBJECTIVE: We evaluated nofazinlimab for multiple advanced malignancies in Chinese patients. PATIENTS AND METHODS: This was a phase 1a/1b, open-label, multicenter, dose-escalation/expansion trial. In phase 1a, patients received an abbreviated dose escalation of nofazinlimab at 60 mg and 200 mg every 3 weeks (Q3W) to determine DLTs and the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D). In phase 1b, patients received the RP2D (monotherapy/combination) in six arms by tumor type; DLTs were evaluated for nofazinlimab plus lenvatinib in the unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (uHCC) arm. Safety (continuously monitored in patients who received nofazinlimab) and efficacy (patients with measurable baseline disease) were assessed. RESULTS: Overall, 107 patients were eligible and received nofazinlimab. In phase 1a, no DLTs were observed; the RP2D was 200mg Q3W. In phase 1b, no DLTs were observed with nofazinlimab plus lenvatinib. The safety profile was consistent with that observed in the first-in-human study (NCT03475251). In phase 1b, 21/88 (23.9%) patients achieved confirmed objective responses, 26 (29.5%) had stable disease, and 9/20 (45.0%) patients with uHCC achieved confirmed objective responses to nofazinlimab plus lenvatinib.

69,Phase I Study of Lenalidomide and Sorafenib in Patients With Advanced Hepatocellular Carcinoma.,10.1634/theoncologist.2016-0071,"LESSONS LEARNED: Combination therapies in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma can be associated with overlapping toxicity and are therefore poorly tolerated.Using sorafenib at the maximum tolerated dose can lead to a higher incidence of toxicities. Consequently, combination studies might evaluate sorafenib at alternative schedules or doses to improve tolerance, recognizing this could affect sorafenib efficacy.Although this combination was poorly tolerated, it does not exclude further evaluation of new-generation immunomodulator drugs or immune checkpoint inhibitors in the hope of optimizing tolerance and safety. BACKGROUND: Sorafenib is the standard treatment for advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), and to date, no combination therapy has demonstrated superior survival compared with sorafenib alone. The immunosuppressive microenvironment in HCC is a negative predictor for survival. Lenalidomide is an immunomodulator and antiangiogenic agent, with limited single-agent efficacy in HCC. Based on these data, we designed a phase I study of sorafenib plus lenalidomide to determine the safety and preliminary antitumor activity of this combination. METHODS: This was an open-label, phase I study with a 3+3 dose escalation/de-escalation design. The starting dose of sorafenib was 400 mg p.o. b.i.d. and of lenalidomide was 15 mg p.o. daily with a planned dose escalation by 5 mg per cohort up to 25 mg daily. Dose de-escalation was planned to a sorafenib dose of 400 mg p.o. daily combined with two doses of lenalidomide: 10 mg p.o. daily for a 28-day cycle (cohort 1) and 10 mg p.o. daily for a 21- or 28-day cycle (cohort 2). Patients with cirrhosis, a Child-Pugh score of A-B7, and no previous systemic therapy were eligible. RESULTS: Five patients were enrolled. Their median age was 56 years (range 39-61), and the ECOG status was 0-2. Four patients were treated at dose level (DL) 1. Because of the poor tolerance to the combination associated with grade 2 toxicities, one more patient was treated at DL -1. No dose-limiting toxicity was observed as specified per protocol. The most common toxicities were nausea, anorexia, pruritus, elevated liver enzymes, and elevated bilirubin. Three patients experienced one or more of the following grade 3 toxicities: fatigue (DL 1), increased bilirubin (DL 1), skin desquamation (DL -1), and elevated transaminase levels (DL 1). The median duration of therapy was 1 cycle (range 1-3). All patients discontinued the study, 4 because of progressive disease and 1 by patient preference. The best confirmed response was progressive disease. The median progression-free survival was 1.0 month (95% confidence interval 0.9-2.8), and the median overall survival was 5.9 months (95% confidence interval 3.68-23.4). CONCLUSION: In our small study, the combination of lenalidomide and sorafenib was poorly tolerated and showed no clinical activity. Although the study was closed early because of toxicity concerns, future studies assessing combinations of sorafenib with new-generation immunomodulator drugs or other immunomodulatory agents, should consider lower starting doses of sorafenib to avoid excessive toxicity. property of the authors.",Shahda S; Loehrer PJ; Clark RS; Spittler AJ; Althouse SK; Chiorean EG,False,patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma,sorafenib plus lenalidomide,not specified,safety and preliminary antitumor activity,"open-label, phase I study",No comparison to standard therapy or placebo specified; outcomes not focused on survival or response rate.,False,-,-,-,-,-,The study lacks a comparison group and focuses on safety and preliminary antitumor activity rather than survival or response rates.,,,False
70,Protocol of notable-HCC: a phase Ib study of neoadjuvant tislelizumab with stereotactic body radiotherapy in patients with resectable hepatocellular carcinoma.,10.1136/bmjopen-2022-060955,"INTRODUCTION: Liver resection is the mainstay of curative-intent treatment for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), but the postoperative 5-year recurrence rate reaches 70%, and there are no adjuvant or neoadjuvant therapies recommended by major HCC guidelines that can reduce the risk of recurrence. In the recent decade, significant progress has been achieved in the systemic treatment of HCC, mainly from immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) and targeted therapy. In other malignancies, ICIs in the neoadjuvant setting have shown better outcomes than in the adjuvant setting. On the other hand, the addition of radiation to ICIs incrementally improves the systemic response to ICIs. Neoadjuvant therapy of ICIs plus stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) has shown promising results in several types of solid tumours but not HCC. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: Here, we describe a phase Ib clinical trial of neoadjuvant SBRT plus PD-1 (tislelizumab) prior to hepatic resection in HCC patients. Prior to resection, eligible HCC patients will receive 8 Gy×3 fractions of SBRT together with two cycles of tislelizumab with an interval of 3 weeks. HCC resection is scheduled 4 weeks after the second dose of tislelizumab, followed by adjuvant tislelizumab for 1 year. We plan to enrol 20 participants in this trial. The primary study endpoints include the delay of surgery, tumour response and safety and tolerability of the sequential SBRT/tislelizumab. Other endpoints are the disease-free survival and overall survival rates every 3 or 6 months after the surgery. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: This trial was approved by the Ethics Committee of Shandong Cancer Hospital and Institute (SDZLEC2022-021-01).

71,PRIME-HCC: phase Ib study of neoadjuvant ipilimumab and nivolumab prior to liver resection for hepatocellular carcinoma.,10.1186/s12885-021-08033-x,"BACKGROUND: After liver resection (LR), patients with hepatocellular cancer (HCC) are at high risk of recurrence. There are no approved anti-cancer therapies known to affect such risk, highlighting the acute need for novel systemic therapies to control the probability of disease relapse. Immunotherapy is expanding as a novel treatment option for HCC. Emerging data from cohort 4 of the CA209-040 study, which investigated the safety and preliminary efficacy of nivolumab/ipilimumab co-administration in advanced HCC, suggest that the combination can be delivered safely with an acceptable proportion of reversible grade 3-4 toxicities (27.1%) and a low discontinuation rate (2%) in patients with HCC. Here, we describe the design and rationale of PRIME-HCC, a two-part, multi-centre, phase Ib study to assess safety and bioactivity of the nivolumab/ipilimumab combination prior to LR in early-stage HCC. METHODS: The study involves an initial safety run-in phase (Part 1) to allow for preliminary safety characterisation within the first 6 patients enrolled and a subsequent expansion (Part 2). Ipilimumab will be administered once only on Day 1. Nivolumab will be administered on Day 1 and Day 22 (± 3 days) for a total of two 21-day cycles (i.e. 6 weeks of treatment). The primary objective of the study is to determine the safety and tolerability of the nivolumab/ipilimumab combination prior to LR. The secondary objective is to preliminarily characterize the efficacy of the combination prior to LR, including objective response rate (ORR) and pathologic response rates.

72,Phase I study of the antiprogrammed cell death-1 Ab spartalizumab (PDR001) in Japanese patients with advanced malignancies.,10.1111/cas.14678,"Spartalizumab is a humanized IgG4/κ mAb directed against human programmed cell death-1 (PD-1). In this phase I study, we investigated safety, pharmacokinetics, preliminary antitumor activity, and toxicity of spartalizumab in patients with advanced malignancies. Patients (n = 18) with a range of tumor types received spartalizumab i.v. at doses of 1, 3, and 10 mg/kg every 2 weeks until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or discontinuation at the discretion of the investigator or patient. Most patients (61%) had received five or more prior lines of therapy. No dose-limiting toxicities were reported and, hence, the maximum tolerated dose was 10 mg/kg or more. Pharmacokinetics in Japanese patients aligned with those reported in a global dose-escalation study. The safety profile was consistent with other approved anti-PD-1 mAbs; the most common drug-related adverse events were maculopapular rash (22%), followed by malaise and increased blood alkaline phosphatase (11% each). Partial responses were reported in two patients (11%), one with transitional cell carcinoma and the other with hepatocellular carcinoma.

73,Neoadjuvant chemotherapy is associated with a transient increase of intratumoral T-cell density in microsatellite stable colorectal liver metastases.,10.1080/15384047.2020.1721252,"Patients with colorectal liver metastases (CLM) commonly receive neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT) prior to surgical resection. NACT may induce immunogenic cell death with subsequent recruitment of T-cells to the tumor microenvironment, which could be exploited by immune checkpoint inhibition (ICI). In theory, this could expand the use of ICI to obtain responses also in microsatellite stable colorectal cancer, but evidence to suggest optimal treatment schedules are lacking. In this study, densities of total-, cytotoxic-, helper- and regulatory T-cells were quantified by immunohistochemistry in resected CLM from 92 patients included in the OSLO-COMET trial (NCT01516710). All but one patient had microsatellite stable tumors (91/92). Associations between T-cell densities and clinicopathological parameters were analyzed. Fluoropyrimidine-based NACT (in most cases with addition of oxaliplatin or irinotecan) was administered to 45 patients completed median 8 weeks prior to surgical resection. No overall association was found between NACT administration and intratumoral T-cell densities. However, within the NACT group, a short time interval (<9.5 weeks) between NACT completion and CLM resection was strongly associated with high intratumoral T-cell densities compared to the long-interval and no NACT groups (medians 491, 236, and 292 cells/mm(2), respectively; P < .0001). The results from this study suggest that the observed increase in intratumoral T-cells after NACT administration may be transient.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Clinicopathological information (age, performance status, smoking, body mass index, histology, organs with metastases), use and duration of proton pump inhibitors, steroids and antibiotics (ATB) and laboratory values [neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio, LDH, albumin] were prospectively collected. Steroid administration was defined as the use of > 10 mg prednisone equivalent for ≥ 10 days. Prolonged ATB administration was defined as ATB ≥ 14 days 30 days before or within the first 3 months of treatment. JADBio, a machine learning pipeline was applied for further multivariate analysis. RESULTS: Data from 66 pts with non-oncogenic driven metastatic NSCLC were analyzed; 15.2% experienced partial response (PR), 34.8% stable disease (SD) and 50% progressive disease (PD). Median overall survival (OS) was 6.77 months. ATB administration did not affect patient OS [HR = 1.35 (CI: 0.761-2.406, p = 0.304)], however, prolonged ATBs [HR = 2.95 (CI: 1.62-5.36, p = 0.0001)] and the presence of bone metastases [HR = 1.89 (CI: 1.02-3.51, p = 0.049)] independently predicted for shorter survival. Prolonged ATB administration, bone metastases, liver metastases and BMI < 25 kg/m2 were selected by JADbio as the important features that were associated with increased probability of developing disease progression as response to treatment. The resulting algorithm that was created was able to predict the probability of disease stabilization (PR or SD) in a single individual with an AUC = 0.806 [95% CI:0.714-0.889].

75,Camrelizumab in combination with apatinib in second-line or above therapy for advanced primary liver cancer: cohort A report in a multicenter phase Ib/II trial.,10.1136/jitc-2020-002191,"BACKGROUND: Emerging clinical data suggest that an immune checkpoint inhibitor in combination with an antiangiogenic agent is a reasonable strategy for multiple malignancies. We assessed the combination of camrelizumab with apatinib in pretreated advanced primary liver cancer (PLC, cohort A) from a multicohort phase Ib/II trial. METHODS: Patients with PLC after prior systemic treatment(s) were administered camrelizumab (3 mg/kg, once every 2 weeks) plus apatinib (125, 250, 375, or 500 mg; once per day) in a 3+3 dose-escalation stage and subsequent expansion stage. The primary endpoints were tolerability and safety of study treatment. RESULTS: From April 2017 to July 2019, 28 patients (21 with hepatocellular carcinoma and 7 with intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma) received camrelizumab plus apatinib. Two dose-limiting toxicities (both grade 3 diarrhea) were reported in the 500 mg cohort. Therefore, the 375 mg cohort was expanded. Of the 19 patients in the 375 mg cohort, dose reduction to 250 mg occurred in 8 patients within 2 months after treatment initiation. Of the 28 patients with PLC, 26 had grade ≥3 treatment-related adverse events, with hypertension being the most common (9/28). One treatment-related death occurred. The objective response rate was 10.7% (95% CI 2.3% to 28.2%). Median progression-free survival and overall survival were 3.7 months (95% CI 2.0 to 5.8) and 13.2 months (95% CI 8.9 to not reached), respectively. CONCLUSION: The combination of camrelizumab with apatinib had a manageable toxicity and promising antitumor activity in patients with advanced PLC.

Through the tumor-free survival (TFS) and overall survival (OS) rates analyses of serum AFP and sICAM-1 levels in 87 patients with primary hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), the patients whose AFP and sICAM-1 levels were normal (AFP < 20 μg/L or sICAM-1 < 1000 μg/L) before surgery or recovered to normal after surgery exhibited a lower tumor recurrence rate and better OS than patients with elevated serum levels of the two markers. Combined analysis showed that patients with synchronously elevated levels of AFP and sICAM-1 showed the lowest TFS and OS. In addition, the RNA-seq data and clinical information of The Cancer Genome Atlas Liver Hepatocellular Carcinoma were collected to analyze the predictive values of AFP and ICAM-1 in the diagnosis, prognosis and immunotherapy of HCC. The results indicated that the combined application of the two indicators had higher accuracy in both the diagnosis and prognostic prediction of HCC by receiver operating characteristic curves. AFP and ICAM-1 were significantly correlated with multiple immune cells in HCC samples but not in normal samples. The patients with low expression of the two indicators were most likely to benefit from the immune checkpoint blockade therapy.

We sought to evaluate whether or not ipilimumab immunotherapy administered before or after cytotoxic chemotherapy (nab-paclitaxel+bevacizumab, AB) would impact clinical outcomes. METHODS: We conducted a randomized phase 2 clinical trial of patients with BRAF wild-type metastatic melanoma (up to 2 prior therapies) who received either: (A) AB followed by ipilimumab therapy at progression; or (B) ipilimumab followed by AB treatment at progression. The primary goal of the study was a comparison of AB versus ipilimumab progression-free survival, with secondary clinical and laboratory endpoints. RESULTS: This study did not reach full accrual due to concurrent Food and Drug Administration approval of anti-programmed cell death 1 agents. Nevertheless, the available data suggests a cumulative therapeutic advantage to the sequential use of ipilimumab followed by AB. Correlative laboratory data revealed a favorable effect on systemic immune homeostasis in patients receiving AB therapy, of potential interest in further investigations, especially in the context of chemotherapy/immunotherapy combinations.

This single-arm phase I study sought to assess the safety and preliminary efficacy of icaritin in human as a potential oral immunotherapy in addition to the immune-checkpoint inhibitors. METHODS: Eligible advanced HCC patients with Child-Pugh Class A or B were administered with a fixed oral dose of icaritin at either 600 or 800 mg b.i.d. The primary endpoint was safety, and the secondary endpoints included time-to-progression (TTP), overall survival (OS) and the clinical benefit rate (CBR). Icaritin treatment induced immune biomarkers and immune-modulating activities in myeloid cells were also explored. RESULTS: No drug-related adverse events ≥ Grade 3 were observed in all 20 enrolled HCC patients. Among the 15 evaluable patients, 7 (46.7%) achieved clinical benefit, representing one partial response (PR, 6.7%) and 6 stable disease (SD, 40%). The median TTP was 141 days (range: 20-343 days), and the median OS was 192 days (range: 33-1036 days). Durable survival was observed in PR/SD patients with a median OS of 488 days (range: 72-773). TTP was significantly associated with the dynamic changes of peripheral neutrophils (p = 0.0067) and lymphocytes (p = 0.0337).

Findings from this study suggest bintrafusp alfa may be a novel therapeutic approach for patients with advanced solid tumors. Additional trials are needed to further explore safety and efficacy of bintrafusp alfa in specific tumor types. BACKGROUND: Bintrafusp alfa is a first-in-class bifunctional fusion protein composed of the extracellular domain of transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) RII receptor (a TGF-β ""trap"") fused to a human immunoglobulin (Ig) G1 antibody blocking programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1). Bintrafusp alfa is designed to neutralize TGF-β signaling by ""trapping"" and sequestering all TGF-β isoforms, and this trap function is physically linked to PD-L1 blockade in the tumor microenvironment. METHODS: NCT02699515 was a phase I, open-label, dose-escalation study of bintrafusp alfa (3, 10, and 20 mg/kg every 2 weeks) in Asian patients with advanced solid tumors, including a hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) safety-assessment cohort. The primary objective was safety and tolerability; the secondary objective is best overall response. RESULTS: As of August 24, 2018, 23 patients (including 9 in the HCC cohort) received bintrafusp alfa. Eight patients experienced treatment-related adverse events (TRAEs). Three patients had grade 3 TRAEs (13.0%; hypoacusis, hyponatremia, hypopituitarism, increased blood creatine phosphokinase, and intracranial tumor hemorrhage); one had grade 4 hyponatremia (4.3%).

We conducted a clinical trial on nivolumab for advanced ESCC (JapicCTI-No.142422) and investigated markers using peripheral blood collected from 20 patients enrolled in our institute, including 1 with a complete response (CR), 5 with a partial response (PR), 6 with a stable disease (SD), and 8 with a progressive disease (PD) as clinical responses. The expression of surface molecules and cytokine production by T cells were analyzed using flow cytometry, and clinicopathological factors and general blood parameters were examined. Albumin, neutrophils, %Tim3, %OX40, %CD103, %CD45RA(-)CD27(-), and IL-1b after the first cycle of nivolumab treatment, but not at baseline, distinguished CR/PR from SD/PD patients. When markers to distinguish longer survivors with nivolumab therapy were analyzed, changes in these levels between baseline and after the first cycle of nivolumab treatment, but not levels at each period, were indicative, similar to the tumor burden. Among them, elevations in %Tim-3(+)CD4 had a marked impact on survival rates. In conclusion, dynamic elevations in %Tim-3 in T cells in the early period of nivolumab therapy have potential as a marker for the clinical responses and prognosis of advanced ESCC patients.",Kato R; Yamasaki M; Urakawa S; Nishida K; Makino T; Morimoto-Okazawa A; Kawashima A; Iwahori K; Suzuki S; Ueda R; Mori M; Satoh T; Doki Y; Wada H,False,patients with advanced esophageal squamous cell carcinoma,nivolumab,not specified,clinical responses and prognosis,clinical trial,Population does not match hepatocellular carcinoma; no comparison specified; not a randomized controlled trial,False,-,-,-,-,-,Population does not match hepatocellular carcinoma.

86,"Phase 2 study of pembrolizumab and circulating biomarkers to predict anticancer response in advanced, unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma.",10.1002/cncr.32339,"BACKGROUND: Checkpoint inhibitors have shown modest activity in patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Herein, the authors report a prospective single-institution clinical/translational phase 2 study of pembrolizumab in patients with advanced HCC and circulating biomarkers closely related to response. METHODS: Pembrolizumab was administered at a dose of 200 mg intravenously every 3 weeks among patients who may have developed disease progression while receiving, were intolerant of, or refused sorafenib. The circulating levels of cytokines, chemokines, programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1), programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1), and PD-L2 were correlated with response, tumor PD-L1 expression, and other clinicopathological features. RESULTS: A total of 29 patients were treated and 28 patients were evaluable for response. The most common laboratory grade 3/4 adverse events were increases in aspartate aminotransferase and/or alanine aminotransferase and serum bilirubin, which for the most part were reversible. In terms of efficacy, one patient achieved a complete response and 8 patients achieved partial responses for an overall response rate of 32%. Four other patients had stable disease. The median progression-free survival was 4.5 months and the median overall survival was 13 months. Response did not correlate with prior sorafenib therapy, PD-L1 tumor staining, or a prior history of hepatitis. Correlative studies revealed that high baseline plasma TGF-β levels (≥200 pg/mL) significantly correlated with poor treatment outcomes after pembrolizumab. Tumor PD-L1 and plasma PD-L1/PD-1 levels were associated with plasma IFN-γ or IL-10. CONCLUSIONS: Pembrolizumab was found to demonstrate activity in patients with advanced HCC. Toxicity generally was tolerable and reversible. A set of immunological markers in blood plasma as well as PD-L1 staining indicated that baseline TGF-β could be a predictive biomarker for response to pembrolizumab.",Feun LG; Li YY; Wu C; Wangpaichitr M; Jones PD; Richman SP; Madrazo B; Kwon D; Garcia-Buitrago M; Martin P; Hosein PJ; Savaraj N,False,patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma,pembrolizumab,not specified,"response, tumor PD-L1 expression, clinicopathological features",prospective single-institution clinical/translational phase 2 study,No comparison specified; not a randomized controlled trial,True,-,-,-,-,-,Matches criteria for advanced hepatocellular carcinoma.

87,Phase II Study of Avelumab in Patients with Advanced Hepatocellular Carcinoma Previously Treated with Sorafenib.,10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-20-3094,"PURPOSE: This study investigated the efficacy and safety of avelumab, an anti-programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) antibody, in patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma previously treated with sorafenib (NCT03389126). PATIENTS AND METHODS: This is a single-arm, single center, phase II trial. Patients with Child-Pugh A score who had at least one measurable lesion were enrolled. Intravenous avelumab 10 mg/kg every 2 weeks was given until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. The primary endpoint was objective response rate (ORR) according to RECIST v1.1. Secondary endpoints included time to progression (TTP), overall survival (OS), disease control rate (DCR), and safety. RESULTS: A total of 30 patients were enrolled. After a median follow-up of 13.9 months, 27 progression events and 20 death events occurred. There was no complete response, three (10.0%) partial responses, and 19 patients (63.3%) with stable disease. ORR was 10.0% and DCR was 73.3%. The median TTP and OS was 4.4 and 14.2 months, respectively. PD-L1 expression did not affect avelumab response. Prior duration of sorafenib treatment, when dichotomized by the median 2.7 months, was associated with treatment outcome. TTP (6.5 vs. 1.8 months, P = 0.007) and OS (19.0 vs. 7.8 months, P = 0.006) were superior in patients with longer sorafenib duration. There was tendency of higher ORR (20.0% vs. 0.0%, P = 0.22) in those with longer sorafenib duration. Avelumab was well tolerated with seven grade 3 adverse events and no grade 4 adverse events.

CL1-81694-001 was the first-in-human study aiming at identifying a safe dosing schedule in solid tumour patients. PATIENTS AND METHODS: This trial was based on inter-individual dose-escalation of single agent S81694 in cohorts of ≥3 patients to assess the safety and tolerability and determine dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs), maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and recommended phase II dose (RP2D), with S81694 given on days 1,8,15 of a 28-day cycle as 1-h infusion. RESULTS: 38 patients were treated at doses ranging from 4 to 135 mg/m(2)/week; 144 cycles were administered (median 2/patient; range 1-32 cycles). Patients discontinued treatment for disease progression (78.9%), adverse events (AE; 18.4%) or withdrawal of consent (2.6%). Treatment modifications occurred in 22 patients (57.9%; 49 cycles). Common treatment-emergent AEs were fatigue (22 patients;57.9%), anaemia (17;44.7%) and nausea (12;31.6%). Haematological toxicity was mild, with Grade 3 anaemia observed in three patients and neutropenia mainly seen at the 135 mg/m(2) dose level. Three first cycle DLTs included G3 anaemia (4 mg/m(2) dose), G4 hypertension (20 mg/m(2)), G3 fatigue (135 mg/m(2)). MTD was not reached due to premature discontinuation of enrolment based on a sponsor decision. Among 35 patients evaluable for response, one (renal cell carcinoma) had a complete response, one (hepatocellular carcinoma) had a transient decrease of target lesions and 13 had stable disease. Seven patients remained on study for ≥6 cycles, two at the 135 mg/m(2) dose. CONCLUSIONS: S81694 can be administered safely as a single agent in adults with solid tumours on days 1,8,15 of a 28-day cycle up to a dose of 135 mg/m(2)/week without reaching MTD. The RP2D was not defined due to the prioritization of the use of S81694 in combination with cytotoxic agents, based on emerging preclinical data.

89,Camrelizumab Combined with FOLFOX4 Regimen as First-Line Therapy for Advanced Hepatocellular Carcinomas: A Sub-Cohort of a Multicenter Phase Ib/II Study.,10.2147/DDDT.S304857,"BACKGROUND: Immune checkpoint inhibitors and chemotherapy can synergistically increase efficacy in a variety of malignancies. We conducted this phase Ib/II study to assess the safety and efficacy of anti-PD-1 antibody camrelizumab in combination with FOLFOX4 for treatment-naive advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (aHCC). METHODS: This open-label, multicenter phase Ib/II study (NCT03092895) enrolled patients with aHCC and without prior systemic treatment for treatment with camrelizumab (3 mg/kg) and FOLFOX4 every two weeks. First, six patients were enrolled, followed by an additional 28 patients after dose-limiting toxicity cases were determined to be <33% of patients. The primary endpoint was tolerability and safety of treatment. RESULTS: A total of 34 aHCC patients were enrolled and received study treatment. No dose-limiting toxicity were observed in the first six patients enrolled. Twenty-nine (85.3%) of the total 34 patients had grade ≥3 treatment-related adverse events (TRAEs), with the most common ones being decreased neutrophil count (55.9%) and decreased white blood cell count (38.2%). No TRAEs-related deaths occurred. The objective response and disease control rate were 29.4% (95% CI, 15.1-47.5) and 79.4% (95% CI, 62.1-91.3), respectively. The median duration of response, progression-free survival, and overall survival was 6.9 months (range, 3.3-11.5), 7.4 months (95% CI, 3.9-9.2), and 11.7 months (95% CI, 8.2-22.0), respectively.

90,A Phase Ib Trial of Durvalumab in Combination with Trastuzumab in HER2-Positive Metastatic Breast Cancer (CCTG IND.229).,10.1634/theoncologist.2019-0321,"BACKGROUND: Immune checkpoint inhibitors are active in a broad range of cancers, including programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1)-positive, triple-negative, metastatic breast cancer (MBC). Antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity is a mechanism of action of trastuzumab. We performed a phase Ib trial of durvalumab and trastuzumab in HER2-positive MBC previously treated with chemotherapy and anti-HER2 antibodies to assess safety, efficacy, and correlative endpoints. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients with HER2-positive MBC were enrolled on a standard 3 + 3 design. Dose level 1 was durvalumab (1,125 mg intravenously day 1) and trastuzumab (8 mg/kg intravenously loading, then 6 mg/kg day 1) on a q3 weekly cycle. An expansion cohort at the recommended phase II dose (RP2D) performed tumor biopsies at baseline and after cycle 1. The primary endpoint was to establish the RP2D. RESULTS: Fifteen patients were accrued from April to December 2016, of which 14 were evaluable for response. Median age was 54 years (range 40-86); the majority had visceral disease (87%) and at least three prior (adjuvant and/or metastatic) lines of chemotherapy (73%), including trastuzumab (93%), pertuzumab (60%), and trastuzumab-emtansine (93%) for MBC. No dose-limiting toxicities were observed at dose level 1 (n = 6) or dose expansion (n = 9) during cycle 1. One patient developed a grade ≥3 immune-related adverse event (grade 4 diabetes mellitus). No responses by RECIST were seen, with 4 of 14 patients (29%) demonstrating stable disease as best response at week 6 (median duration, 2.7 months). All patients had <1% PD-L1 expression on either archival tissue (7/15) or prestudy biopsy (8/15). In the dose expansion cohort, evaluable pretreatment and on-treatment tumor biopsies (n = 5) showed minimal CD8 cell infiltration. CONCLUSION: The RP2D of durvalumab and trastuzumab is standard full doses of both agents. No significant clinical activity was observed in patients with heavily pretreated HER2-positive PD-L1-negative MBC. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: This phase Ib trial with associated correlative endpoints provides insights into the lack of activity of the combination of durvalumab and trastuzumab in heavily pretreated HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer (MBC). No significant clinical activity was observed in patients with heavily pretreated HER2-positive programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1)-negative MBC with evidence of cytotoxic T-cell exhaustion. Furthermore, all patients had no expression of PD-L1 in the tumor cells. These data support the importance of PD-L1 as an important selection biomarker and the need to assess the tumor microenvironment for immune regulatory cells.

91,A pilot study of intrahepatic yttrium-90 microsphere radioembolization in combination with intravenous cisplatin for uveal melanoma liver-only metastases.,10.1002/cnr2.1183,"BACKGROUND: Metastatic uveal melanoma is a highly aggressive disease with no standard of care treatment option. A large proportion of patients have liver-only metastatic disease which raises the question if liver-directed therapy can be efficacious in this subpopulation. AIMS: The study aims to evaluate the safety and efficacy of radiosensitizing chemotherapy in combination with yttrium-90 microspheres in patients with uveal melanoma with liver-only metastases. METHODS AND RESULTS: This single arm, open labeled, non-randomized study enrolled 10 patients with liver-only metastatic uveal melanoma between November 2012 and January 2018. Eligible patients received intrahepatic yttrium-90 microspheres followed by intravenous cisplatin (20 mg/m(2)) for 5 days. Ten patients were enrolled, but nine patients received treatment who were included in the final analysis with a median follow-up of 30 months (range 7 to 44). Five (50%) were female, five (50%) had an elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and one (10%) had prior anti-PD-1 therapy. The combination was well tolerated with no greater than or equal to grade 3 toxicity observed. The liver objective response rate (ORR) was 33% (3/9), the median progression-free survival (PFS) in the liver was 3 months (95% CI, 3-NA), and the extrahepatic PFS was 3 months (95% CI, 3-NA). Seventy-eight percent (7/9) received an immune checkpoint inhibitor on disease progression, with no responses seen. The median overall survival (OS) was 10 months (95% CI, 7-NA).
