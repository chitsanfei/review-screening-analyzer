0,"Camrelizumab plus rivoceranib versus sorafenib as first-line therapy for unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (CARES-310): a randomised, open-label, international phase 3 study.",10.1016/S0140-6736(23)00961-3,"BACKGROUND: Immunotherapy with immune checkpoint inhibitors combined with an anti-angiogenic tyrosine-kinase inhibitor (TKI) has been shown to improve overall survival versus anti-angiogenic therapy alone in advanced solid tumours, but not in hepatocellular carcinoma. Therefore, a clinical study was conducted to compare the efficacy and safety of the anti-PD-1 antibody camrelizumab plus the VEGFR2-targeted TKI rivoceranib (also known as apatinib) versus sorafenib as first-line treatment for unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma. METHODS: This randomised, open-label, international phase 3 trial (CARES-310) was done at 95 study sites across 13 countries and regions worldwide. Patients with unresectable or metastatic hepatocellular carcinoma who had not previously received any systemic treatment were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive either camrelizumab 200 mg intravenously every 2 weeks plus rivoceranib 250 mg orally once daily or sorafenib 400 mg orally twice daily. Randomisation was done via a centralised interactive response system. The primary endpoints were progression-free survival, as assessed by the blinded independent review committee per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumours version 1.1, and overall survival in the intention-to-treat population. Safety was assessed in all patients who received at least one dose of the study drugs. We report the findings from the prespecified primary analysis for progression-free survival and interim analysis for overall survival. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT03764293). FINDINGS: Between June 28, 2019, and March 24, 2021, 543 patients were randomly assigned to the camrelizumab-rivoceranib (n=272) or sorafenib (n=271) group. At the primary analysis for progression-free survival (May 10, 2021), median follow-up was 7·8 months (IQR 4·1-10·6). Median progression-free survival was significantly improved with camrelizumab-rivoceranib versus sorafenib (5·6 months [95% CI 5·5-6·3] vs 3·7 months [2·8-3·7]; hazard ratio [HR] 0·52 [95% CI 0·41-0·65]; one-sided p<0·0001). At the interim analysis for overall survival (Feb 8, 2022), median follow-up was 14·5 months (IQR 9·1-18·7). Median overall survival was significantly extended with camrelizumab-rivoceranib versus sorafenib (22·1 months [95% CI 19·1-27·2] vs 15·2 months [13·0-18·5]; HR 0·62 [95% CI 0·49-0·80]; one-sided p<0·0001). The most common grade 3 or 4 treatment-related adverse events were hypertension (102 [38%] of 272 patients in the camrelizumab-rivoceranib group vs 40 [15%] of 269 patients in the sorafenib group), palmar-plantar erythrodysaesthesia syndrome (33 [12%] vs 41 [15%]), increased aspartate aminotransferase (45 [17%] vs 14 [5%]), and increased alanine aminotransferase (35 [13%] vs eight [3%]). Treatment-related serious adverse events were reported in 66 (24%) patients in the camrelizumab-rivoceranib group and 16 (6%) in the sorafenib group. Treatment-related death occurred in two patients: one patient in the camrelizumab-rivoceranib group (ie, multiple organ dysfunction syndrome) and one patient in the sorafenib group (ie, respiratory failure and circulatory collapse). INTERPRETATION: Camrelizumab plus rivoceranib showed a statistically significant and clinically meaningful benefit in progression-free survival and overall survival compared with sorafenib for patients with unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma, presenting as a new and effective first-line treatment option for this population.

1,"Lenvatinib Combined With Transarterial Chemoembolization as First-Line Treatment for Advanced Hepatocellular Carcinoma: A Phase III, Randomized Clinical Trial (LAUNCH).",10.1200/JCO.22.00392,"PURPOSE: Lenvatinib (LEN) is a first-line therapy for patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC); however, it has shown modest survival benefits. Therefore, we aimed to compare clinical outcomes of LEN combined with transarterial chemoembolization (LEN-TACE) versus LEN monotherapy in patients with advanced HCC. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This was a multicenter, randomized, open-label, parallel group, phase III trial. Patients with primary treatment-naive or initial recurrent advanced HCC after surgery were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive LEN plus on-demand TACE (LEN-TACE) or LEN monotherapy. LEN was initiated within 3 days after random assignment (initial dose: 12 mg once daily for patients ≥ 60 kg; 8 mg once daily for patients < 60 kg). TACE was initiated one day after LEN initiation. The primary end point was overall survival (OS). RESULTS: Between June 2019 and July 2021, a total of 338 patients underwent random assignment at 12 centers in China: 170 to LEN-TACE and 168 to LEN. At a prespecified event-driven interim analysis after a median follow-up of 17.0 months, the median OS was significantly longer in the LEN-TACE group (17.8 v 11.5 months; hazard ratio, 0.45; P < .001). The median progression-free survival was 10.6 months in the LEN-TACE group and 6.4 months in the LEN group (hazard ratio, 0.43; P < .001). Patients in the LEN-TACE group had a higher objective response rate according to the modified RECIST (54.1% v 25.0%, P < .001). Multivariable analysis revealed that portal vein tumor thrombus and treatment allocation were independent risk factors for OS. CONCLUSION: The addition of TACE to LEN improves clinical outcomes and is a potential first-line treatment for patients with advanced HCC.",Peng Z; Fan W; Zhu B; Wang G; Sun J; Xiao C; Huang F; Tang R; Cheng Y; Huang Z; Liang Y; Fan H; Qiao L; Li F; Zhuang W; Peng B; Wang J; Li J; Kuang M,False,intervention does not match ICIs,patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma,LEN combined with transarterial chemoembolization,LEN monotherapy,overall survival,"multicenter, randomized, open-label, parallel group, phase III trial",False,Model A's analysis is correct.

We aimed to investigate nivolumab monotherapy compared with sorafenib monotherapy in the first-line setting for patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma. METHODS: In this randomised, open-label, phase 3 trial done at medical centres across 22 countries and territories in Asia, Australasia, Europe, and North America, patients at least 18 years old with histologically confirmed advanced hepatocellular carcinoma not eligible for, or whose disease had progressed after, surgery or locoregional treatment; with no previous systemic therapy for hepatocellular carcinoma, with Child-Pugh class A and Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status score of 0 or 1, and regardless of viral hepatitis status were randomly assigned (1:1) via an interactive voice response system to receive nivolumab (240 mg intravenously every 2 weeks) or sorafenib (400 mg orally twice daily) until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. The primary endpoint was overall survival assessed in the intention-to-treat population. Safety was assessed in all patients who received at least one dose of study drug. This completed trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT02576509. FINDINGS: Between Jan 11, 2016, and May 24, 2017, 743 patients were randomly assigned to treatment (nivolumab, n=371; sorafenib, n=372). At the primary analysis, the median follow-up for overall survival was 15·2 months (IQR 5·7-28·0) for the nivolumab group and 13·4 months (5·7-25·9) in the sorafenib group. Median overall survival was 16·4 months (95% CI 13·9-18·4) with nivolumab and 14·7 months (11·9-17·2) with sorafenib (hazard ratio 0·85 [95% CI 0·72-1·02]; p=0·075; minimum follow-up 22·8 months); the protocol-defined significance level of p=0·0419 was not reached. The most common grade 3 or worse treatment-related adverse events were palmar-plantar erythrodysaesthesia (1 [<1%] of 367 patients in the nivolumab group vs 52 [14%] of patients in the sorafenib group), aspartate aminotransferase increase (22 [6%] vs 13 [4%]), and hypertension (0 vs 26 [7%]). Serious treatment-related adverse events were reported in 43 (12%) patients receiving nivolumab and 39 (11%) patients receiving sorafenib. Four deaths in the nivolumab group and one death in the sorafenib group were assessed as treatment related. INTERPRETATION: First-line nivolumab treatment did not significantly improve overall survival compared with sorafenib, but clinical activity and a favourable safety profile were observed in patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma. Thus, nivolumab might be considered a therapeutic option for patients in whom tyrosine kinase inhibitors and antiangiogenic drugs are contraindicated or have substantial risks.

3,IL-7 and CCL19-secreting CAR-T cell therapy for tumors with positive glypican-3 or mesothelin.,10.1186/s13045-021-01128-9,"Although chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-engineered T cells have shown great success in the treatment of B cell malignancies, this strategy has limited efficacy in patients with solid tumors. In mouse CAR-T cells, IL-7 and CCL19 expression have been demonstrated to improve T cell infiltration and CAR-T cell survival in mouse tumors. Therefore, in the current study, we engineered human CAR-T cells to secrete human IL-7 and CCL19 (7 × 19) and found that these 7 × 19 CAR-T cells showed enhanced capacities of expansion and migration in vitro. Furthermore, 7 × 19 CAR-T cells showed superior tumor suppression ability compared to conventional CAR-T cells in xenografts of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cell lines, primary HCC tissue samples and pancreatic carcinoma (PC) cell lines. We then initiated a phase 1 clinical trial in advanced HCC/PC/ovarian carcinoma (OC) patients with glypican-3 (GPC3) or mesothelin (MSLN) expression. In a patient with advanced HCC, anti-GPC3-7 × 19 CAR-T treatment resulted in complete tumor disappearance 30 days post intratumor injection. In a patient with advanced PC, anti-MSLN-7 × 19 CAR-T treatment resulted in almost complete tumor disappearance 240 days post-intravenous infusion. Our results demonstrated that the incorporation of 7 × 19 into CAR-T cells significantly enhanced the antitumor activity against human solid tumor. Trial registration: NCT03198546.

We aimed to compare the overall survival of patients treated with FOLFOX-HAIC versus TACE as first-line treatment in this population. METHODS: In this randomized, multicenter, open-label trial, adults with unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (largest diameter ≥ 7 cm) without macrovascular invasion or extrahepatic spread were randomly assigned 1:1 to FOLFOX-HAIC (oxaliplatin 130 mg/m(2), leucovorin 400 mg/m(2), fluorouracil bolus 400 mg/m(2) on day 1, and fluorouracil infusion 2,400 mg/m(2) for 24 hours, once every 3 weeks) or TACE (epirubicin 50 mg, lobaplatin 50 mg, and lipiodol and polyvinyl alcohol particles). The primary end point was overall survival by intention-to-treat analysis. Safety was assessed in patients who received ≥ 1 cycle of study treatment. RESULTS: Between October 1, 2016, and November 23, 2018, 315 patients were randomly assigned to FOLFOX-HAIC (n = 159) or TACE (n = 156). The median overall survival in the FOLFOX-HAIC group was 23.1 months (95% CI, 18.5 to 27.7) versus 16.1 months (95% CI, 14.3 to 17.9) in the TACE group (hazard ratio, 0.58; 95% CI, 0.45 to 0.75; P < .001). The FOLFOX-HAIC group showed a higher response rate than the TACE group (73 [46%] v 28 [18%]; P < .001) and a longer median progression-free survival (9.6 [95% CI, 7.4 to 11.9] v 5.4 months [95% CI, 3.8 to 7.0], P < .001). The incidence of serious adverse events was higher in the TACE group than in the FOLFOX-HAIC group (30% v 19%, P = .03).

5,Efficacy and Safety of Nivolumab Plus Ipilimumab in Patients With Advanced Hepatocellular Carcinoma Previously Treated With Sorafenib: The CheckMate 040 Randomized Clinical Trial.,10.1001/jamaoncol.2020.4564,"IMPORTANCE: Most patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) are diagnosed with advanced disease not eligible for potentially curative therapies; therefore, new treatment options are needed. Combining nivolumab with ipilimumab may improve clinical outcomes compared with nivolumab monotherapy. OBJECTIVE: To assess efficacy and safety of nivolumab plus ipilimumab in patients with advanced HCC who were previously treated with sorafenib. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: CheckMate 040 is a multicenter, open-label, multicohort, phase 1/2 study. In the nivolumab plus ipilimumab cohort, patients were randomized between January 4 and September 26, 2016. Treatment group information was blinded after randomization. Median follow-up was 30.7 months. Data cutoff for this analysis was January 2019. Patients were recruited at 31 centers in 10 countries/territories in Asia, Europe, and North America. Eligible patients had advanced HCC (with/without hepatitis B or C) previously treated with sorafenib. A total of 148 patients were randomized (50 to arm A and 49 each to arms B and C). INTERVENTIONS: Patients were randomized 1:1:1 to either nivolumab 1 mg/kg plus ipilimumab 3 mg/kg, administered every 3 weeks (4 doses), followed by nivolumab 240 mg every 2 weeks (arm A); nivolumab 3 mg/kg plus ipilimumab 1 mg/kg, administered every 3 weeks (4 doses), followed by nivolumab 240 mg every 2 weeks (arm B); or nivolumab 3 mg/kg every 2 weeks plus ipilimumab 1 mg/kg every 6 weeks (arm C). MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Coprimary end points were safety, tolerability, and objective response rate. Duration of response was also measured (investigator assessed with the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors v1.1). RESULTS: Of 148 total participants, 120 were male (81%). Median (IQR) age was 60 (52.5-66.5). At data cutoff (January 2019), the median follow-up was 30.7 months (IQR, 29.9-34.7). Investigator-assessed objective response rate was 32% (95% CI, 20%-47%) in arm A, 27% (95% CI, 15%-41%) in arm B, and 29% (95% CI, 17%-43%) in arm C. Median (range) duration of response was not reached (8.3-33.7+) in arm A and was 15.2 months (4.2-29.9+) in arm B and 21.7 months (2.8-32.7+) in arm C. Any-grade treatment-related adverse events were reported in 46 of 49 patients (94%) in arm A, 35 of 49 patients (71%) in arm B, and 38 of 48 patients (79%) in arm C; there was 1 treatment-related death (arm A; grade 5 pneumonitis). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this randomized clinical trial, nivolumab plus ipilimumab had manageable safety, promising objective response rate, and durable responses. The arm A regimen (4 doses nivolumab 1 mg/kg plus ipilimumab 3 mg/kg every 3 weeks then nivolumab 240 mg every 2 weeks) received accelerated approval in the US based on the results of this study.

6,Personalized neoantigen vaccine and pembrolizumab in advanced hepatocellular carcinoma: a phase 1/2 trial.,10.1038/s41591-024-02894-y,"Programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) inhibitors have modest efficacy as a monotherapy in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). A personalized therapeutic cancer vaccine (PTCV) may enhance responses to PD-1 inhibitors through the induction of tumor-specific immunity. We present results from a single-arm, open-label, phase 1/2 study of a DNA plasmid PTCV (GNOS-PV02) encoding up to 40 neoantigens coadministered with plasmid-encoded interleukin-12 plus pembrolizumab in patients with advanced HCC previously treated with a multityrosine kinase inhibitor. Safety and immunogenicity were assessed as primary endpoints, and treatment efficacy and feasibility were evaluated as secondary endpoints. The most common treatment-related adverse events were injection-site reactions, observed in 15 of 36 (41.6%) patients. No dose-limiting toxicities or treatment-related grade ≥3 events were observed. The objective response rate (modified intention-to-treat) per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors 1.1 was 30.6% (11 of 36 patients), with 8.3% (3 of 36) of patients achieving a complete response. Clinical responses were associated with the number of neoantigens encoded in the vaccine. Neoantigen-specific T cell responses were confirmed in 19 of 22 (86.4%) evaluable patients by enzyme-linked immunosorbent spot assays. Multiparametric cellular profiling revealed active, proliferative and cytolytic vaccine-specific CD4(+) and CD8(+) effector T cells. T cell receptor β-chain (TCRβ) bulk sequencing results demonstrated vaccination-enriched T cell clone expansion and tumor infiltration. Single-cell analysis revealed posttreatment T cell clonal expansion of cytotoxic T cell phenotypes. TCR complementarity-determining region cloning of expanded T cell clones in the tumors following vaccination confirmed reactivity against vaccine-encoded neoantigens. Our results support the PTCV's mechanism of action based on the induction of antitumor T cells and show that a PTCV plus pembrolizumab has clinical activity in advanced HCC.

We aimed to investigate the activity of sequential transarterial chemoembolisation (TACE) and stereotactic body radiotherapy followed by avelumab (an anti-PD-L1 drug) for locally advanced, unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma. METHODS: START-FIT was a single-arm, phase 2 trial in patients with locally advanced hepatocellular carcinoma who were not suitable for curative treatment, conducted in two hospitals in Hong Kong and one in Shenzhen, China. Eligible patients were those aged 18 years or older with an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status 0-1, Child-Pugh liver function score A5 to B7, tumour size of at least 5 cm, a maximum of three tumour lesions, and adequate hepatic, renal, and bone marrow function. Participants received TACE on day 1, followed by stereotactic body radiotherapy (27·5-40·0 Gy in five fractions) at day 28. Avelumab (10 mg/kg) was administered 14 days following stereotactic body radiotherapy and every 2 weeks thereafter. The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients deemed amenable to curative treatment, defined as those who had a sustained complete or partial treatment response for at least 2 months and if curative treatment could be performed (ie, resection, radiofrequency ablation, or transplantation), analysed by intention to treat. Safety was also analysed in the intention-to-treat population. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT03817736) and has been completed. FINDINGS: Between March 18, 2019, and Jan 27, 2021, 33 patients (32 [97%] men and one [3%] woman) were enrolled. The median sum of the largest diameters of lesions was 15·1 cm (IQR 8·3-14·9). 21 (64%) patients had macrovascular invasion (hepatic vein [n=13], branched portal vein [n=3], or both [n=5]). Median follow-up was 17·2 months (IQR 7·8-25·8). 18 (55%) patients were deemed amenable to curative treatment: four (12%) of 33 patients had curative treatment (resection [n=2] or radiofrequency ablation [n=2]), and 14 (42%) had a radiological complete response and opted for close surveillance. 11 (33%) of 33 patients had treatment-related adverse events that were grade 3 or worse. The most common treatment-related grade 3 or worse adverse event was transient increase in alanine aminotransferase or aspartate aminotransferase (five [15%]) after TACE. Five (15%) patients developed immune-related adverse events of grade 3 or worse (three had hepatitis, two had dermatitis). INTERPRETATION: To our knowledge, this is the first prospective trial using the combination of immunotherapy and locoregional treatment as conversion therapy for locally advanced unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma, with promising results. Future randomised trials with larger cohorts of patients are warranted.

8,Proton beam radiotherapy vs. radiofrequency ablation for recurrent hepatocellular carcinoma: A randomized phase III trial.,10.1016/j.jhep.2020.09.026,"BACKGROUND & AIMS: Proton beam radiotherapy (PBT) has recently been applied to treat hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC); however, there is no randomized controlled trial-based evidence on its safety and efficacy. We compared the outcomes of PBT and radiofrequency ablation (RFA) in patients with recurrent/residual HCC (rHCC) in a phase III non-inferiority trial. METHODS: Patients with rHCC (size <3 cm, number ≤2) were randomly assigned to receive PBT or RFA according to Child-Pugh score and tumor stage. After randomization, if the assigned treatment was technically infeasible, crossover was allowed. The primary endpoint was 2-year local progression-free survival (LPFS), with a non-inferiority margin of 15% in the per-protocol (PP) population; a complementary analysis was performed in the intention-to-treat (ITT) population (NCT01963429). RESULTS: The ITT population comprised 144 patients receiving either PBT (n = 72) or RFA (n = 72). Six patients switched from the PBT arm to the RFA arm and 19 patients switched from the RFA arm to the PBT arm. In the PP population, the 2-year LPFS rate with PBT (n = 80) vs. RFA (n = 56) was 94.8% vs. 83.9%, a difference of 10.9 percentage points (90% CI 1.8-20.0; p <0.001); in the ITT population, the 2-year LPFS rate with PBT vs. RFA was 92.8% vs. 83.2%, a difference of 9.6 percentage points (90% CI 0.7-18.4; p <0.001), meeting the criteria for non-inferiority. The 3- and 4-year LPFS rates for PBT were also non-inferior to those for RFA. The most common adverse events were radiation pneumonitis (32.5%) and decreased leukocyte counts (23.8%) for PBT and increased alanine aminotransferase levels (96.4%) and abdominal pain (30.4%) for RFA. No Grade 4 adverse events or mortality were noted. CONCLUSIONS: PBT showed LPFS values that were non-inferior to those for RFA; in addition, PBT was tolerable and safe. CLINICAL TRIAL NUMBER: #NCT01963429 (ClinicalTrials.gov). LAY SUMMARY: Radiofrequency ablation is the standard of care for patients with small hepatocellular carcinoma in whom surgery is not feasible. This study is the first phase III randomized controlled trial to evaluate the clinical outcomes of proton beam radiotherapy vs. radiofrequency ablation in patients with recurrent small HCC.

DESIGN: Patients with unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) were randomised to TACE plus sorafenib (n=80) or TACE alone (n=76). Patients in the combination group received sorafenib 400 mg once daily for 2-3 weeks before TACE, followed by 800 mg once daily during on-demand conventional TACE sessions until time to untreatable (unTACEable) progression (TTUP), defined as untreatable tumour progression, transient deterioration to Child-Pugh C or appearance of vascular invasion/extrahepatic spread. Co-primary endpoints were progression-free survival (PFS), which is not a conventional one but defined as TTUP, or time to any cause of death plus overall survival (OS). Multiplicity was adjusted by gatekeeping hierarchical testing. RESULTS: Median PFS was significantly longer in the TACE plus sorafenib than in the TACE alone group (25.2 vs 13.5 months; p=0.006). OS was not analysed because only 73.6% of OS events were reached. Median TTUP (26.7 vs 20.6 months; p=0.02) was also significantly longer in the TACE plus sorafenib group. OS at 1 year and 2 years in TACE plus sorafenib group and TACE alone group were 96.2% and 82.7% and 77.2% and 64.6%, respectively. There were no unexpected toxicities. CONCLUSION: TACE plus sorafenib significantly improved PFS over TACE alone in patients with unresectable HCC. Adverse events were consistent with those of previous TACE combination trials.

10,Randomized Phase 3 LEAP-012 Study: Transarterial Chemoembolization With or Without Lenvatinib Plus Pembrolizumab for Intermediate-Stage Hepatocellular Carcinoma Not Amenable to Curative Treatment.,10.1007/s00270-021-03031-9,"PURPOSE: Transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) is the standard of care for patients with intermediate-stage hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Lenvatinib, a multikinase inhibitor, and pembrolizumab, a PD-1 inhibitor, have shown efficacy and tolerability in patients with HCC, and adding this combination to TACE may enhance clinical benefit. PROTOCOL: LEAP-012 is a prospective, double-blind randomized phase 3 study. Adults with confirmed HCC localized to the liver without portal vein thrombosis and not amenable to curative treatment, ≥ 1 measurable tumor per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors 1.1 (RECIST 1.1), Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status 0 or 1, Child-Pugh class A and no previous systemic treatment for HCC are eligible. Patients will be randomly assigned to lenvatinib once daily plus pembrolizumab every 6 weeks plus TACE or placebos plus TACE. Dual primary endpoints are overall survival and progression-free survival per RECIST 1.1 by blinded independent central review (BICR). Secondary endpoints are progression-free survival, objective response rate, disease control rate, duration of response and time to progression per modified RECIST by BICR; objective response rate, disease control rate, duration of response and time to progression per RECIST 1.1 by BICR; and safety. STATISTICS: The planned sample size, 950 patients, was calculated to permit accumulation of sufficient overall survival events in 5 years to achieve 90% power for the overall survival primary endpoint. DISCUSSION: LEAP-012 will evaluate the clinical benefit of adding lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab to TACE in patients with intermediate-stage HCC not amenable to curative treatment.

11,(90)Y Radioembolization versus Drug-eluting Bead Chemoembolization for Unresectable Hepatocellular Carcinoma: Results from the TRACE Phase II Randomized Controlled Trial.,10.1148/radiol.211806,"Background Transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) is the recommended treatment for intermediate hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) according to the Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer guidelines. Prospective uncontrolled studies suggest that yttrium 90 ((90)Y) transarterial radioembolization (TARE) is a safe and effective alternative. Purpose To compare the efficacy and safety of TARE with TACE for unresectable HCC. Materials and Methods In this single-center prospective randomized controlled trial (TRACE), (90)Y glass TARE was compared with doxorubicin drug-eluting bead (DEB) TACE in participants with intermediate-stage HCC, extended to Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status 1 and those with early-stage HCC not eligible for surgery or thermoablation. Participants were recruited between September 2011 and March 2018. The primary end point was time to overall tumor progression (TTP) (Kaplan-Meier analysis) in the intention-to-treat (ITT) and per-protocol (PP) groups. Results At interim analysis, 38 participants (median age, 67 years; IQR, 63-72 years; 33 men) were randomized to the TARE arm and 34 (median age, 68 years; IQR, 61-71 years; 30 men) to the DEB-TACE arm (ITT group). Median TTP was 17.1 months in the TARE arm versus 9.5 months in the DEB-TACE arm (ITT group hazard ratio [HR], 0.36; 95% CI: 0.18, 0.70; P = .002) (PP group, 32 and 34 participants, respectively, in each arm; HR, 0.29; 95% CI: 0.14, 0.60; P < .001). Median overall survival was 30.2 months after TARE and 15.6 months after DEB-TACE (ITT group HR, 0.48; 95% CI: 0.28, 0.82; P = .006). Serious adverse events grade 3 or higher (13 of 33 participants [39%] vs 19 of 36 [53%] after TARE and DEB-TACE, respectively; P = .47) and 30-day mortality (0 of 33 participants [0%] vs three of 36 [8.3%]; P = .24) were similar in the safety groups. At the interim, the HR for the primary end point, TTP, was less than 0.39, meeting the criteria to halt the study. Conclusion With similar safety profile, yttrium 90 radioembolization conferred superior tumor control and survival compared with chemoembolization using drug-eluting beads in selected participants with early or intermediate hepatocellular carcinoma.

12,Single-cell immune signature for detecting early-stage HCC and early assessing anti-PD-1 immunotherapy efficacy.,10.1136/jitc-2021-003133,"BACKGROUND: The early diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) can greatly improve patients' 5-year survival rate, and the early efficacy assessment is important for oncologists to harness the anti-programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) immunotherapy in patients with advanced HCC. The lack of effective predicting biomarkers not only leads to delayed detection of the disease but also results in ineffective immunotherapy and limited clinical survival benefit. METHODS: We exploited the single-cell approach (cytometry by time of flight (CyTOF)) to analyze peripheral blood mononuclear cells from multicohorts of human samples. Immune signatures for different stages of patients with HCC were systematically profiled and statistically compared. Furthermore, the dynamic changes of peripheral immune compositions for both first-line and second-line patients with HCC after anti-PD-1 monotherapy were also evaluated and systematically compared. RESULTS: We identified stage-specific immune signatures for HCC and constructed a logistic AdaBoost-SVM classifier based on these signatures. The classifier provided superior performance in predicting early-stage HCC over the commonly used serum alpha-fetoprotein level. We also revealed the treatment stage-specific immune signatures from peripheral blood and their dynamical changing patterns, all of which were integrated to achieve early discrimination of patients with non-durable benefit for both first-line and second-line anti-PD-1 monotherapies. CONCLUSIONS: Our newly identified single-cell peripheral immune signatures provide promising non-invasive biomarkers for early detection of HCC and early assessment for anti-PD-1 immunotherapy efficacy in patients with advanced HCC. These new findings can potentially facilitate early diagnosis and novel immunotherapy for patients with HCC in future practice and further guide the utility of CyTOF in clinical translation of cancer research.

13,Uncoupling immune trajectories of response and adverse events from anti-PD-1 immunotherapy in hepatocellular carcinoma.,10.1016/j.jhep.2022.03.039,"BACKGROUND & AIMS: While immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) has shown promise in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), it is associated with modest response rates and immune-related adverse events (irAEs) are common. In this study, we aimed to decipher immune trajectories and mechanisms of response and/or irAEs in patients with HCC receiving anti-programmed cell death 1 (anti-PD-1) therapy. METHODS: Pre- and on-treatment peripheral blood samples (n = 60) obtained from 32 patients with HCC (Singapore cohort) were analysed by cytometry by time-of-flight and single-cell RNA sequencing, with flow cytometric validation in an independent Korean cohort (n = 29). Mechanistic validation was conducted by bulk RNA sequencing of 20 pre- and on-treatment tumour biopsies and using a murine HCC model treated with different immunotherapeutic combinations. RESULTS: Single-cell analyses identified CXCR3(+)CD8(+) effector memory T (T(EM)) cells and CD11c(+) antigen-presenting cells (APC) as associated with response (p = 0.0004 and 0.0255, respectively), progression-free survival (p = 0.00079 and 0.0015, respectively), and irAEs (p = 0.0034 and 0.0125, respectively) in anti-PD-1-treated patients with HCC. Type-1 conventional dendritic cells were identified as the specific APC associated with response, while 2 immunosuppressive CD14(+) myeloid clusters were linked to reduced irAEs. Further analyses of CXCR3(+)CD8(+) T(EM) cells showed cell-cell interactions specific to response vs. irAEs, from which the anti-PD-1 and anti-TNFR2 combination was harnessed to uncouple these effects, resulting in enhanced response without increased irAEs in a murine HCC model. CONCLUSIONS: This study identifies early predictors of clinical response to anti-PD-1 ICB in patients with HCC and offers mechanistic insights into the immune trajectories of these immune subsets at the interface between response and toxicity. We also propose a new combination immunotherapy for HCC to enhance response without exacerbating irAEs. CLINICAL TRIAL NUMBER: NCT03695952. LAY SUMMARY: Response rates to immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) treatment in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remain modest and adverse events are common.

14,Immune signatures of checkpoint inhibitor-induced autoimmunity-A focus on neurotoxicity.,10.1093/neuonc/noad198,"BACKGROUND: Neurologic immune-related adverse events (irAE-n) are rare but severe toxicities of immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) treatment. To overcome diagnostic and therapeutic challenges, a better mechanistic understanding of irAE-n is paramount. METHODS: In this observational cohort study, we collected serum and peripheral blood samples from 34 consecutive cancer patients with irAE-n (during acute illness) and 49 cancer control patients without irAE-n (pre- and on-ICI treatment, n = 44 without high-grade irAEs, n = 5 with high-grade nonneurologic irAEs). Patients received either anti-programmed cell death protein (PD)-1 or anti-PD ligand-1 monotherapy or anti-PD-1/anti-cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated protein-4 combination therapy. Most common cancers were melanoma, lung cancer, and hepatocellular carcinoma. Peripheral blood immune profiling was performed using 48-marker single-cell mass cytometry and a multiplex cytokine assay. RESULTS: During acute illness, patients with irAE-n presented higher frequencies of cluster of differentiation (CD)8+ effector memory type (EM-)1 and central memory (CM) T cells compared to controls without irAEs. Multiorgan immunotoxicities (neurologic + nonneurologic) were associated with higher CD8+ EM1 T cell counts. While there were no B cell changes in the overall cohort, we detected a marked decrease of IgD- CD11c+ CD21low and IgD- CD24+ CD21high B cells in a subgroup of patients with autoantibody-positive irAE-n. We further identified signatures indicative of enhanced chemotaxis and inflammation in irAE-n patients and discovered C-X-C motif chemokine ligand (CXCL)10 as a promising marker to diagnose high-grade immunotoxicities such as irAE-n. CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrate profound and partly subgroup-specific immune cell dysregulation in irAE-n patients, which may guide future biomarker development and targeted treatment approaches.

METHODS: Initially, 20 patients with HCC were screened and 18 patients with resectable HCC were enrolled in this open-label, single-arm, phase II clinical trial. Patients received three cycles of neoadjuvant therapy including three doses of camrelizumab concurrent with apatinib for 21 days followed by surgery. Four to 8 weeks after surgery, patients received eight cycles of adjuvant therapy with camrelizumab in combination with apatinib. Major pathological reactions (MPR), complete pathological reactions (pCR), objective response rate (ORR), relapse-free survival (RFS), and adverse events (AE) were assessed. In addition, cancer tissue and plasma samples were collected before and after treatment, and genetic differences between responding and non-responding lesions were compared by tumor immune microenvironment (TIME) analysis, circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) analysis and proteomics analysis. RESULTS: In 18 patients with HCC who completed neoadjuvant therapy, 3 (16.7%) and 6 (33.3%) patients with HCC reached ORR based on Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) V.1.1 and modified RECIST criteria, respectively. Of the 17 patients with HCC who received surgical resection, 3 (17.6%) patients with HCC reported MPR and 1 (5.9%) patient with HCC achieved pCR. The 1-year RFS rate of the enrolled patients was 53.85% (95% CI: 24.77% to 75.99%). Grade 3/4 AEs were reported in 3 (16.7%) of the 18 patients, with the most common AEs being rash (11.1%), hypertension (5.6%), drug-induced liver damage (5.6%), and neutropenia (5.6%) in the preoperative phase. The 289 NanoString panel RNA sequencing showed that TIME cell infiltration especially dendritic cells (DCs) infiltration was better in responding tumors than in non-responding tumors. Our results of ctDNA revealed a higher positive rate (100%) among patients with HCC with stage IIb-IIIa disease. When comparing patients with pCR/MPR and non-MPR, we observed more mutations in patients who achieved pCR/MPR at baseline (6 mutations vs 2.5 mutations, p=0.025). Patients who were ctDNA positive after adjuvant therapy presented a trend of shorter RFS than those who were ctDNA negative. Proteomic analysis suggested that abnormal glucose metabolism in patients with multifocal HCC might be related to different sensitivity of treatment in different lesions. CONCLUSION: Perioperative camrelizumab plus apatinib displays a promising efficacy and manageable toxicity in patients with resectable HCC. DCs infiltration might be a predictive marker of response to camrelizumab and apatinib as well as patients' recurrence. ctDNA as a compose biomarker can predict pathological response and relapse. Abnormal glucose metabolism in patients with multifocal HCC may be related to different sensitivity of treatment in different lesions.

16,"Neoadjuvant cemiplimab for resectable hepatocellular carcinoma: a single-arm, open-label, phase 2 trial.",10.1016/S2468-1253(21)00385-X,"BACKGROUND: Surgical resection of early stage hepatocellular carcinoma is standard clinical practice; however, most tumours recur despite surgery, and no perioperative intervention has shown a survival benefit. Neoadjuvant immunotherapy has induced pathological responses in multiple tumour types and might decrease the risk of postoperative recurrence in hepatocellular carcinoma. We aimed to evaluate the clinical activity of neoadjuvant cemiplimab (an anti-PD-1) in patients with resectable hepatocellular carcinoma. METHODS: For this single-arm, open-label, phase 2 trial, patients with resectable hepatocellular carcinoma (stage Ib, II, and IIIb) were enrolled and received two cycles of neoadjuvant cemiplimab 350 mg intravenously every 3 weeks followed by surgical resection. Eligible patients were aged 18 years or older, had confirmed resectable hepatocellular carcinoma, an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0 or 1, and adequate liver function. Patients were excluded if they had metastatic disease, if the surgery was not expected to be curative, if they had a known additional malignancy requiring active treatment, or if they required systemic steroid treatment or any other immunosuppressive therapy. After resection, patients received an additional eight cycles of cemiplimab 350 mg intravenously every 3 weeks in the adjuvant setting. The primary endpoint was significant tumour necrosis on pathological examination (defined as >70% necrosis of the resected tumour). Secondary endpoints included delay of surgery, the proportion of patients with an overall response, change in CD8(+) T-cell density, and adverse events. Tumour necrosis and response were analysed in all patients who received at least one dose of cemiplimab and completed surgical resection; safety and other endpoints were analysed in the intention-to-treat population. Patients underwent pre-treatment biopsies and blood collection throughout treatment. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT03916627, Cohort B) and is ongoing. FINDINGS: Between Aug 5, 2019, and Nov 25, 2020, 21 patients were enrolled. All patients received neoadjuvant cemiplimab, and 20 patients underwent successful resection. Of the 20 patients with resected tumours, four (20%) had significant tumour necrosis. Three (15%) of 20 patients had a partial response, and all other patients maintained stable disease. 20 (95%) patients had a treatment-emergent adverse event of any grade during the neoadjuvant treatment period. The most common adverse events of any grade were increased aspartate aminotransferase (in four patients), increased blood creatine phosphokinase (in three), constipation (in three), and fatigue (in three). Seven patients had grade 3 adverse events, including increased blood creatine phosphokinase (in two patients) and hypoalbuminaemia (in one). No grade 4 or 5 events were observed. One patient developed pneumonitis, which led to a delay in surgery by 2 weeks. INTERPRETATION: This report is, to our knowledge, the largest clinical trial of a neoadjuvant anti-PD-1 monotherapy reported to date in hepatocellular carcinoma. The observed pathological responses to cemiplimab in this cohort support the design of larger trials to identify the optimal treatment duration and definitively establish the clinical benefit of preoperative PD-1 blockade in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma.

17,"Lenvatinib plus anti-PD-1 antibodies as conversion therapy for patients with unresectable intermediate-advanced hepatocellular carcinoma: a single-arm, phase II trial.",10.1136/jitc-2023-007366,"BACKGROUND: Over 70% of the patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) are diagnosed at an advanced stage and lose the opportunity for radical surgery. Combination therapy of tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) and anti-programmed cell death protein-1 (PD-1) antibodies has achieved a high tumor response rate in both the first-line and second-line treatment of advanced HCC. However, few studies have prospectively evaluated whether TKIs plus anti-PD-1 antibodies could convert unresectable intermediate-advanced HCC into resectable disease. METHODS: This single-arm, phase II study enrolled systemic therapy-naïve adult patients with unresectable Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer stage B or C HCC. Patients received oral lenvatinib one time per day plus intravenous anti-PD-1 agents every 3 weeks (one cycle). Tumor response and resectability were evaluated before the fourth cycle, then every two cycles. The primary endpoint was conversion success rate by investigator assessment. Secondary endpoints included objective response rate (ORR) by independent imaging review (IIR) assessment per modified RECIST (mRECIST) and Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors, V.1.1 (RECIST 1.1), progression-free survival (PFS) and 12-month recurrence-free survival (RFS) rate by IIR per mRECIST, R0 resection rate, overall survival (OS), and safety. Biomarkers were assessed as exploratory objectives. RESULTS: Of the 56 eligible patients enrolled, 53 (94.6%) had macrovascular invasion, and 16 (28.6%) had extrahepatic metastasis. The median follow-up was 23.5 months. The primary endpoint showed a conversion success rate of 55.4% (31/56). ORR was 53.6% per mRECIST and 44.6% per RECIST 1.1. Median PFS was 8.9 months, and median OS was 23.9 months. Among the 31 successful conversion patients, 21 underwent surgery with an R0 resection rate of 85.7%, a pathological complete response rate of 38.1%, and a 12-month RFS rate of 47.6%. Grade ≥3 treatment-related adverse events were observed in 42.9% of patients. Tumor immune microenvironment analysis of pretreatment samples displayed significant enrichment of CD8(+) T cells (p=0.03) in responders versus non-responders. CONCLUSION: Lenvatinib plus anti-PD-1 antibodies demonstrate promising efficacy and tolerable safety as conversion therapy in unresectable HCC.

18,Hepatocellular carcinoma patients with high circulating cytotoxic T cells and intra-tumoral immune signature benefit from pembrolizumab: results from a single-arm phase 2 trial.,10.1186/s13073-021-00995-8,"BACKGROUND: A limited number of studies have characterized genomic properties of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients in response to anti-PD-1 immunotherapy. METHODS: Herein, we performed comprehensive molecular characterization of immediate (D-42 to D-1) pre-treatment tumor biopsy specimens from 60 patients with sorafenib-failed HCC in a single-arm prospective phase II trial of pembrolizumab. Objective response rate was the primary efficacy endpoint. We used whole-exome sequencing, RNA sequencing, and correlative analysis. In addition, we performed single-cell RNA sequencing using peripheral blood mononuclear cells. RESULTS: The overall response rate of pembrolizumab in sorafenib-failed HCC patients was 10% ([6/60] 95% CI, 2.4-17.6). In a univariate analysis using clinicopathological features, female gender, PD-L1 positivity, and low neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) were identified as contributing factors to pembrolizumab response. Somatic mutations in CTNNB1 and genomic amplifications in MET were found only in non-responders. Transcriptional profiles through RNA sequencing identified that pembrolizumab responders demonstrated T cell receptor (TCR) signaling activation with expressions of MHC genes, indicating increased levels of T cell cytotoxicity. In single-cell sequencing from 10 pre- and post-treatment peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), patients who achieved a partial response or stable disease exhibited immunological shifts toward cytotoxic CD8+ T cells. Conversely, patients with progressive disease showed an increased number of both CD14+ and CD16+ monocytes and activation of neutrophil-associated pathways. CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, HCC patients with infiltration of cytotoxic T cells, along with increased active circulating CD8+ T cells during pembrolizumab treatment and down-regulation of neutrophil-associated markers, significantly benefited from pembrolizumab treatment.

The multicenter, single-arm, phase 2 RENOBATE trial tested regorafenib-nivolumab as front-line treatment for uHCC. Forty-two patients received nivolumab 480 mg every 4 weeks and regorafenib 80 mg daily (3-weeks-on/1-week-off schedule). The primary endpoint was the investigator-assessed objective response rate (ORR) per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) version 1.1. The secondary endpoints included safety, progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS). ORR per RECIST version 1.1 was 31.0%, meeting the primary endpoint. The most common adverse events were palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia syndrome (38.1%), alopecia (26.2%) and skin rash (23.8%). Median PFS was 7.38 months. The 1-year OS rate was 80.5%, and the median OS was not reached. Exploratory single-cell RNA sequencing analyses of peripheral blood mononuclear cells showed that long-term responders exhibited T cell receptor repertoire diversification, enrichment of genes representing immunotherapy responsiveness in MKI67(+) proliferating CD8(+) T cells and a higher probability of M1-directed monocyte polarization.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of apatinib in patients with pretreated advanced hepatocellular carcinoma. METHODS: AHELP was a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 3 trial done at 31 hospitals in China, in patients (aged ≥18 years) with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma who had previously been refractory or intolerant to at least one line of systemic chemotherapy or targeted therapy. Patients were randomly assigned (2:1) to receive apatinib 750 mg or placebo orally once daily in 28-day treatment cycles. Group allocation was done with a central randomisation system, with a block size of six, and was stratified by Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status, previous sorafenib treatment, and presence of vascular invasion or extrahepatic metastasis. The primary endpoint was overall survival, which was defined as time from randomisation to death from any cause, and was analysed in patients who were randomly assigned and received at least one dose of the study drug. Safety analyses were done in patients who received at least one dose of the study treatment and had post-dose safety assessments. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT02329860. FINDINGS: Between April 1, 2014, and May 3, 2017, 400 eligible patients were randomly assigned to receive apatinib (n=267) or placebo (n=133). Seven patients (six in the apatinib group and one in the placebo group) did not receive study treatment and were excluded from efficacy analyses. Overall survival was significantly improved in the apatinib group compared with the placebo group (median 8·7 months [95% CI 7·5‒9·8] vs 6·8 months [5·7‒9·1]; hazard ratio 0·785 [95% CI 0·617‒0·998], p=0·048). 387 patients (257 in the apatinib group and 130 in the placebo group) had a safety assessment after study treatment and were included in safety analyses. The most common treatment-related adverse events of grade 3 or 4 were hypertension (71 [28%] patients in the apatinib group vs three [2%] in the placebo group), hand-foot syndrome (46 [18%] vs none), and decreased platelet count (34 [13%] vs one [1%]). 24 (9%) patients in the apatinib group and 13 (10%) in the placebo group died due to adverse events, but none of these deaths were deemed to be related to treatment by investigators.

Nivolumab monotherapy demonstrated clinical benefit with an acceptable safety profile in patients with aHCC in the CheckMate 040 study. Five-year follow-up of the sorafenib-naive and sorafenib-experienced groups of CheckMate 040 is presented here. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients received nivolumab monotherapy at dose levels of 0.1-10.0 mg/kg (dose-escalation phase) or 3 mg/kg (dose-expansion phase) every 2 weeks until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Primary endpoints were safety and tolerability (dose escalation), and objective response rate (ORR) by blinded independent central review (BICR) and by investigator as per RECIST version 1.1 (dose expansion). RESULTS: Eighty sorafenib-naive and 154 sorafenib-experienced patients were treated. Minimum follow-up in both groups was 60 months. ORR as per BICR was 20% [95% confidence interval (CI) 12% to 30%] and 14% (95% CI 9% to 21%) in the sorafenib-naive and sorafenib-experienced groups, respectively. Responses occurred regardless of HCC etiology or baseline tumor cell programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression levels. Median overall survival (OS) was 26.6 months (95% CI 16.6-30.6 months) and 15.1 months (95% CI 13.0-18.2 months) in sorafenib-naive and sorafenib-experienced patients, respectively. The 3-year OS rates were 28% in the sorafenib-naive and 20% in the sorafenib-experienced groups; 5-year OS rates were 14% and 12%, respectively. No new safety signals were identified; grade 3/4 treatment-related adverse events were observed in 33% and 21% of patients in the sorafenib-naive and sorafenib-experienced groups, respectively. Biomarker analyses showed that baseline PD-L1 expression ≥1% was associated with higher ORR and longer OS compared with PD-L1 <1%. In the sorafenib-naive group, patients with OS ≥3 years exhibited higher baseline CD8 T-cell density compared with those with OS <1 year. CONCLUSION: With 5 years of follow-up, nivolumab monotherapy continued to provide durable clinical benefit with manageable safety in sorafenib-naive and sorafenib-experienced patients with aHCC.",El-Khoueiry AB; Trojan J; Meyer T; Yau T; Melero I; Kudo M; Hsu C; Kim TY; Choo SP; Kang YK; Yeo W; Chopra A; Soleymani S; Yao J; Neely J; Tschaika M; Welling TH; Sangro B,False,Comparison and study design not specified.,patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma,nivolumab monotherapy,not specified,"objective response rate, overall survival",not specified,False,"Model A's decision is correct.

22,Fuzheng Jiedu Xiaoji formulation inhibits hepatocellular carcinoma progression in patients by targeting the AKT/CyclinD1/p21/p27 pathway.,10.1016/j.phymed.2021.153575,"BACKGROUND: Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a common malignant tumor with limited treatment options. Conventional antitumor therapy combined with traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) to limit tumor progression has gradually become the focus of complementary and alternative therapies for HCC treatment. The Fuzheng Jiedu Xiaoji formulation (FZJDXJ) alleviates the clinical symptoms of patients and inhibits tumor progression, but its curative effect still requires extensive clinical research and mechanistic analysis. PURPOSE: To explore the effectiveness of FZJDXJ in HCC patients and investigate its biological function and mechanism underlying anticancer therapy. METHODS: This randomized controlled clinical trial enrolled 291 HCC patients receiving transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (TACE) therapy; patients received either FZJDXJ combined with standard treatment, or standard treatment alone, for 48 weeks. Statistical analyses were performed according to survival time at the end of the trial. The main constituents of the FZJDXJ extracts were identified and evaluated using high-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS/MS) and molecular docking. The antitumor effects of FZJDXJ and its specific biological mechanism of action were studied. RESULTS: After 48 weeks of treatment, one-year overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) were significantly different between the two groups. Co-administration of FZJDXJ and TACE prolonged the OS of HCC patients, especially in BCLC A or B stage. FZJDXJ and TACE treatment effectively extended the PFS of patients, especially in the BCLC B stage. HPLC-MS/MS identified 1619 active constituents of FZJDXJ, including formononetin, chlorogenic acid (CGA), caffeic acid, luteolin, gallic acid, diosgenin, ergosterol endoperoxide, and lupeol, which may function through the AKT/CyclinD1/p21/p27 pathways. Through molecular docking, CGA and gallic acid could effectively combine with Thr308, an important phosphorylation site of AKT1. FZJDXJ inhibited tumor growth in nude mice. In vitro, FZJDXJ-mediated serum inhibited the proliferation, migration, and invasion of liver cancer cells, and promoted cell apoptosis. CONCLUSION: Clinically, FZJDXJ combined with TACE therapy significantly prolonged OS and PFS and reduced the mortality rate of HCC patients. Mechanistically, FZJDXJ effectively inhibited the proliferation and migration of liver cancer cells through the modulation of the AKT/CyclinD1/p21/p27 pathways, and may be a promising TCM drug for anti-HCC therapy.",Yang X; Feng Y; Liu Y; Ye X; Ji X; Sun L; Gao F; Zhang Q; Li Y; Zhu B; Wang X,False,Intervention is not an immune checkpoint inhibitor.,HCC patients receiving TACE therapy,FZJDXJ combined with standard treatment,standard treatment alone,"overall survival, progression-free survival",randomized controlled clinical trial,False,Model A's decision is correct.

23,"Perioperative nivolumab monotherapy versus nivolumab plus ipilimumab in resectable hepatocellular carcinoma: a randomised, open-label, phase 2 trial.",10.1016/S2468-1253(21)00427-1,"BACKGROUND: Hepatocellular carcinoma has high recurrence rates after surgery; however, there are no approved standard-of-care neoadjuvant or adjuvant therapies. Immunotherapy has been shown to improve survival in advanced hepatocellular carcinoma; we therefore aimed to evaluate the safety and tolerability of perioperative immunotherapy in resectable hepatocellular carcinoma. METHODS: In this single-centre, randomised, open-label, phase 2 trial, patients with resectable hepatocellular carcinoma were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive 240 mg of nivolumab intravenously every 2 weeks (for up to three doses before surgery at 6 weeks) followed in the adjuvant phase by 480 mg of nivolumab intravenously every 4 weeks for 2 years, or 240 mg of nivolumab intravenously every 2 weeks (for up to three doses before surgery) plus one dose of 1 mg/kg of ipilimumab intravenously concurrently with the first preoperative dose of nivolumab, followed in the adjuvant phase by 480 mg of nivolumab intravenously every 4 weeks for up to 2 years plus 1 mg/kg of ipilimumab intravenously every 6 weeks for up to four cycles. Patients were randomly assigned to the treatment groups by use of block randomisation with a random block size. The primary endpoint was the safety and tolerability of nivolumab with or without ipilimumab. Secondary endpoints were the proportion of patients with an overall response, time to progression, and progression-free survival. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT03222076) and is completed. FINDINGS: Between Oct 30, 2017, and Dec 3, 2019, 30 patients were enrolled and 27 were randomly assigned: 13 to nivolumab and 14 to nivolumab plus ipilimumab. Grade 3-4 adverse events were higher with nivolumab plus ipilimumab (six [43%] of 14 patients) than with nivolumab alone (three [23%] of 13). The most common treatment-related adverse events of any grade were increased alanine aminotransferase (three [23%] of 13 patients on nivolumab vs seven [50%] of 14 patients on nivolumab plus ipilimumab) and increased aspartate aminotransferase (three [23%] vs seven [50%]). No patients in either group had their surgery delayed due to grade 3 or worse adverse events. Seven of 27 patients had surgical cancellations, but none was due to treatment-related adverse events. Estimated median progression-free survival was 9·4 months (95% CI 1·47-not estimable [NE]) with nivolumab and 19·53 months (2·33-NE) with nivolumab plus ipilimumab (hazard ratio [HR] 0·99, 95% CI 0·31-2·54); median time to progression was 9·4 months (95% CI 1·47-NE) in the nivolumab group and 19·53 months (2·33-NE) in the nivolumab plus ipilimumab group (HR 0·89, 95% CI 0·31-2·54). In an exploratory analysis, three (23%) of 13 patients had an overall response with nivolumab monotherapy, versus none with nivolumab plus ipilimumab. Three (33%) of nine patients had a major pathological response (ie, ≥70% necrosis in the resected tumour area) with nivolumab monotherapy compared with three (27%) of 11 with nivolumab plus ipilimumab. INTERPRETATION: Perioperative nivolumab alone and nivolumab plus ipilimumab appears to be safe and feasible in patients with resectable hepatocellular carcinoma.

24,Long-term Effects of Repeat Hepatectomy vs Percutaneous Radiofrequency Ablation Among Patients With Recurrent Hepatocellular Carcinoma: A Randomized Clinical Trial.,10.1001/jamaoncol.2019.4477,"IMPORTANCE: Repeat hepatectomy and percutaneous radiofrequency ablation (PRFA) are most commonly used to treat early-stage recurrent hepatocellular carcinoma (RHCC) after initial resection, but previous studies comparing the effectiveness of the 2 treatments have reported conflicting results. OBJECTIVE: To compare the long-term survival outcomes after repeat hepatectomy with those after PRFA among patients with early-stage RHCC. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This open-label randomized clinical trial was conducted at the Eastern Hepatobiliary Surgery Hospital and the National Center for Liver Cancer of China. A total of 240 patients with RHCC (with a solitary nodule diameter of ≤5 cm; 3 or fewer nodules, each ≤3 cm in diameter; and no macroscopic vascular invasion or distant metastasis) were randomized 1:1 to receive repeat hepatectomy or PRFA between June 3, 2010, and January 15, 2013. The median (range) follow-up time was 44.3 (4.3-90.6) months (last follow-up, January 15, 2018). Data analysis was conducted from June 15, 2018, to September 28, 2018. INTERVENTIONS: Repeat hepatectomy (n = 120) or PRFA (n = 120). MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcome was overall survival (OS). Secondary outcomes included repeat recurrence-free survival (rRFS), patterns of repeat recurrence, and therapeutic safety. RESULTS: Among the 240 randomized patients (216 men [90.0%]; median [range] age, 53.0 [24.0-59.0] years), 217 completed the trial. In the intention-to-treat (ITT) population, the 1-year, 3-year, and 5-year OS rates were 92.5% (95% CI, 87.9%-97.3%), 65.8% (95% CI, 57.8%-74.8%), and 43.6% (95% CI, 35.5%-53.5%), respectively, for the repeat hepatectomy group and 87.5% (95% CI, 81.8%-93.6%), 52.5% (95% CI, 44.2%-62.2%), and 38.5% (95% CI, 30.6%-48.4%), respectively, for the PRFA group (P = .17). The corresponding 1-year, 3-year, and 5-year rRFS rates were 85.0% (95% CI, 78.8%-91.6%), 52.4% (95% CI, 44.2%-62.2%), and 36.2% (95% CI, 28.5%-46.0%), respectively, for the repeat hepatectomy group and 74.2% (95% CI, 66.7%-82.4%), 41.7% (95% CI, 33.7%-51.5%), and 30.2% (95% CI, 22.9%-39.8%), respectively, for the PRFA group (P = .09). Percutaneous radiofrequency ablation was associated with a higher incidence of local repeat recurrence (37.8% vs 21.7%, P = .04) and early repeat recurrence than repeat hepatectomy (40.3% vs 23.3%, P = .04). In subgroup analyses, PRFA was associated with worse OS vs repeat hepatectomy among patients with an RHCC nodule diameter greater than 3 cm (hazard ratio, 1.72; 95% CI, 1.05-2.84) or an α fetoprotein level greater than 200 ng/mL (hazard ratio, 1.85; 95% CI, 1.15-2.96). Surgery had a higher complication rate than did ablation (22.4% vs 7.3%, P = .001). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: No statistically significant difference was observed in survival outcomes after repeat hepatectomy vs PRFA for patients with early-stage RHCC. Repeat hepatectomy may be associated with better local disease control and long-term survival in patients with an RHCC diameter greater than 3 cm or an AFP level greater than 200 ng/mL.

This study evaluated the pharmacokinetics, exposure-response, and exposure-pharmacodynamics relationships of tremelimumab in patients with unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (uHCC). PATIENTS AND METHODS: A previous tremelimumab population pharmacokinetic model was validated using data from parts 2 and 3 of Study 22. Exposure-response analyses explored relationships of tremelimumab exposure with efficacy and safety. Pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics relationships were evaluated using linear and nonlinear regression models. RESULTS: The observed pharmacokinetics of tremelimumab in uHCC were consistent with predictions; no significant covariates were identified. Tremelimumab exposure was not significantly associated with adverse events, objective response rate, or progression-free survival. Overall survival (OS) was longer for patients with tremelimumab exposure, minimum serum drug concentration (Cmin1) ≥ median versus Cmin1 < median (18.99 months vs. 10.97 months), but this exposure-survival analysis might be confounded with baseline characteristics of albumin level and neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio, which had a significant impact on OS (P = 0.0004 and 0.0001, respectively). The predicted Cmin1 of tremelimumab in STRIDE regimen (12.9 μg/mL) was greater than the estimated concentration of tremelimumab eliciting half-maximal increases (EC50 = 5.24 μg/mL) in CD8+Ki67+ T-cell counts.

27,Upregulation of C/EBPα Inhibits Suppressive Activity of Myeloid Cells and Potentiates Antitumor Response in Mice and Patients with Cancer.,10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-21-0986,"PURPOSE: To evaluate the mechanisms of how therapeutic upregulation of the transcription factor, CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein alpha (C/EBPα), prevents tumor progression in patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and in different mouse tumor models. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: We conducted a phase I trial in 36 patients with HCC (NCT02716012) who received sorafenib as part of their standard care, and were given therapeutic C/EBPα small activating RNA (saRNA; MTL-CEBPA) as either neoadjuvant or adjuvant treatment. In the preclinical setting, the effects of MTL-CEBPA were assessed in several mouse models, including BNL-1ME liver cancer, Lewis lung carcinoma (LLC), and colon adenocarcinoma (MC38). RESULTS: MTL-CEBPA treatment caused radiologic regression of tumors in 26.7% of HCC patients with an underlying viral etiology with 3 complete responders. MTL-CEBPA treatment in those patients caused a marked decrease in peripheral blood monocytic myeloid-derived suppressor cell (M-MDSC) numbers and an overall reduction in the numbers of protumoral M2 tumor-associated macrophages (TAM). Gene and protein analysis of patient leukocytes following treatment showed CEBPA activation affected regulation of factors involved in immune-suppressive activity. To corroborate this observation, treatment of all the mouse tumor models with MTL-CEBPA led to a reversal in the suppressive activity of M-MDSCs and TAMs, but not polymorphonuclear MDSCs (PMN-MDSC). The antitumor effects of MTL-CEBPA in these tumor models showed dependency on T cells. This was accentuated when MTL-CEBPA was combined with checkpoint inhibitors or with PMN-MDSC-targeted immunotherapy. CONCLUSIONS: This report demonstrates that therapeutic upregulation of the transcription factor C/EBPα causes inactivation of immune-suppressive myeloid cells with potent antitumor responses across different tumor models and in cancer patients. MTL-CEBPA is currently being investigated in combination with pembrolizumab in a phase I/Ib multicenter clinical study (NCT04105335).",Hashimoto A; Sarker D; Reebye V; Jarvis S; Sodergren MH; Kossenkov A; Sanseviero E; Raulf N; Vasara J; Andrikakou P; Meyer T; Huang KW; Plummer R; Chee CE; Spalding D; Pai M; Khan S; Pinato DJ; Sharma R; Basu B; Palmer D; Ma YT; Evans J; Habib R; Martirosyan A; Elasri N; Reynaud A; Rossi JJ; Cobbold M; Habib NA; Gabrilovich DI,False,Intervention is not an immune checkpoint inhibitor.,patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma,MTL-CEBPA,not specified,radiologic regression of tumors,phase I trial,False,Model A's decision is correct.

Sintilimab significantly prolonged RFS compared to active surveillance (median RFS, 27.7 versus 15.5 months; hazard ratio 0.534, 95% confidence interval 0.360-0.792; P = 0.002). Further follow-up is needed to confirm the difference in OS. In the sintilimab group, 12.4% of patients experienced grade 3 or 4 treatment-related adverse events, the most common of which were elevated alanine aminotransferase levels (5.2%) and anemia (4.1%). These findings support the potential of immune checkpoint inhibitors as effective adjuvant therapy for these high-risk patients.

29,A Phase I Study of Locoregional High-Dose Autologous Natural Killer Cell Therapy With Hepatic Arterial Infusion Chemotherapy in Patients With Locally Advanced Hepatocellular Carcinoma.,10.3389/fimmu.2022.879452,"BACKGROUND: To explore the feasibility and safety of natural killer (NK) cell therapy in HCC, we performed a prospective, open-label, phase I trial to evaluate the synergistic effect of locoregional high-dose autologous NK cell therapy in combination with hepatic arterial infusion chemotherapy (HAIC). METHODS: Patients with locally advanced HCC who were refractory to the standard treatment were eligible for this study. Patients received expanded and activated NK cells for 5 consecutive days in a dose-escalating manner (dose 2.5×10(8), 5×10(8), 10×10(8) NK cells/injection) through hepatic arterial infusion following 4 cycles of HAIC with 5-fluorouracil (750 mg/m(2)) and cisplatin (25 mg/m(2)). The primary endpoint was the safety of NK cell-based immunotherapy, and the secondary endpoints were objective response rate (ORR), progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), and immunologic responses. RESULTS: Of the 11 patients enrolled, the confirmed ORR was 63.6% (complete response [CR]: 36.4%, confirmed partial response [PR]: 27.3%). Stable disease (SD) and progressive disease (PD) were observed in two patients (18.2%) each, resulting in a disease control rate (DCR) of 81.8%. The median PFS and OS were 10.3 and 41.6 months, respectively. There were no incidences of decompensation or severe adverse events during HAIC, and no adverse events related to NK cell infusion were noted. CONCLUSION: The combination of HAIC and locoregional high-dose NK cell therapy is a safe and effective treatment for locally advanced HCC patients who were refractory to the standard treatment. This result warrants further development of this novel treatment to establish its efficacy in HCC.

METHODS: We generated a prospectively maintained database including patients treated with atezolizumab plus bevacizumab for unresectable HCC across Europe, Asia and USA. Clinico-pathologic characteristics were assessed for their prognostic influence on overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) in univariable and multivariate analyses. Overall response rate by RECIST v1.1 and treatment-related adverse events (TRAEs) per CTCAE v.5.0 were reported. RESULTS: Out of 433 patients, 296 Child-Pugh A and ECOG performance status01 patients received atezolizumab plus bevacizumab in first line and were included. Patients were mostly male (82.7%), cirrhotic (75%) with history of viral hepatitis (65.9%). Overall, 68.9% had Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer C-stage HCC with portal vein tumour thrombosis (PVTT, 35%) and extrahepatic spread (EHS, 51.7%).

This phase I/IIa pilot trial evaluated preliminary efficacy and safety of combination of radioembolization with yttrium-90 microspheres (Y90-radioembolization) and durvalumab in patients with locally advanced unresectable HCC. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients with Child-Pugh score ≤ 7 and locally advanced HCC, defined as Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC) stage B HCC or BCLC-C disease without extrahepatic metastases, received Y90-radioembolization followed by intravenous durvalumab 1,500 mg 7 to 14 days after Y90-radioembolization and every 4 weeks thereafter. Primary endpoint was time to progression (TTP) assessed by modified RECIST (mRECIST). Secondary endpoints included overall survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS), objective response rate (ORR) determined by mRECIST, and safety. RESULTS: All 24 patients enrolled received Y90-radioembolization and 23 received at least one dose of durvalumab. Median follow-up duration was 19.0 months (range, 2.2-24.2). Median TTP was 15.2 months [95% confidence interval (CI), 6.1-not estimated]. Median OS was not reached and 18-month OS rate was 58.3% (95% CI, 36.4-75.0).

32,Survival in Patients With Recurrent Intermediate-Stage Hepatocellular Carcinoma: Sorafenib Plus TACE vs TACE Alone Randomized Clinical Trial.,10.1001/jamaoncol.2024.1831,"IMPORTANCE: Transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) is commonly used to treat patients with recurrent intermediate-stage hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and positive microvascular invasion (MVI); however, TACE alone has demonstrated unsatisfactory survival benefits. A previous retrospective study suggested that TACE plus sorafenib (SOR-TACE) may be a better therapeutic option compared with TACE alone. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the clinical outcomes of SOR-TACE vs TACE alone for patients with recurrent intermediate-stage HCC after R0 hepatectomy with positive MVI. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: In this phase 3, open-label, multicenter randomized clinical trial, patients with recurrent intermediate-stage HCC and positive MVI were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio via a computerized minimization technique to either SOR-TACE treatment or TACE alone. This trial was conducted at 5 hospitals in China, and enrolled patients from October 2019 to December 2021, with a follow-up period of 24 months. Data were analyzed from June 2023 to September 2023. INTERVENTIONS: Randomization to on-demand TACE (conventional TACE: doxorubicin, 50 mg, mixed with lipiodol and gelatin sponge particles [diameter: 150-350 μm]; drug-eluting bead TACE: doxorubicin, 75 mg, mixed with drug-eluting particles [diameter: 100-300 μm or 300-500 μm]) (TACE group) or sorafenib, 400 mg, twice daily plus on-demand TACE (SOR-TACE group) (conventional TACE: doxorubicin, 50 mg, mixed with lipiodol and gelatin sponge particles [diameter, 150-350 μm]; drug-eluting bead TACE: doxorubicin, 75 mg, mixed with drug-eluting particles [diameter: 100-300 μm or 300-500 μm]). MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary end point was overall survival by intention-to-treat analysis. Safety was assessed in patients who received at least 1 dose of study treatment. RESULTS: A total of 162 patients (median [range] age, 55 [28-75] years; 151 males [93.2%]), were randomly assigned to be treated with either SOR-TACE (n = 81) or TACE alone (n = 81). The median overall survival was significantly longer in the SOR-TACE group than in the TACE group (22.2 months vs 15.1 months; hazard ratio [HR], 0.55; P < .001). SOR-TACE also prolonged progression-free survival (16.2 months vs 11.8 months; HR, 0.54; P < .001), and improved the objective response rate when compared with TACE alone based on the modified Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors criteria (80.2% vs 58.0%; P = .002). Any grade adverse events were more common in the SOR-TACE group, but all adverse events responded well to treatment. No unexpected adverse events or treatment-related deaths occurred in this study. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: The results of this randomized clinical trial demonstrated that SOR-TACE achieved better clinical outcomes than TACE alone. These findings suggest that combined treatment should be used for patients with recurrent intermediate-stage HCC after R0 hepatectomy with positive MVI.

33,Treatment of localized hepatocellular carcinoma: resection vs. ablation vs. radiation.,10.21037/apm-23-486,"Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a common malignancy with many patients presenting with local disease. As of date, the use of radiation is not included in the commonly utilized Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC) classification but is in the National Comprehensive Cancer Network guidelines. Radiation can volumetrically cover the entire tumor and with novel technologic advances can be administered non-invasively with excellent clinical outcomes with few adverse events. The gold standard for localized early HCC (such as BCLC-A) is resection or transplantation. In patients who are not candidates for surgical treatment, locoregional therapy should be considered as an optimal therapy for these patients. Tumor ablation techniques such as microwave ablation (MWA) and radiofrequency ablation (RFA) are excellent tools to control local disease or bridge to transplantation. Should these not be possible though then ablation with external beam radiation is also capable of yielding comparable local control and serve as a bridge to transplant without worse rates of adverse events. For tumors that meet Milan criteria for transplantation, in comparison to transarterial chemoembolization (TACE), there is considerable randomized evidence demonstrating better local control, less adverse events, better progression-free survival (PFS), and less costly. It can be utilized as a bridge in Barcelona liver class B. For larger localized tumors though (extrahepatic disease or vascular invasion like BCLC-C), stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) is shown via a randomized clinical trial to have a survival benefit, local control benefit, and no worse adverse events compared to systemic therapy.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: This nonrandomized, open-label, multicenter, phase II study enrolled patients with advanced HCC who were treatment-naïve or refractory/intolerant to first-line targeted therapy. Patients received intravenous camrelizumab 200 mg (for bodyweight ≥50 kg) or 3 mg/kg (for bodyweight <50 kg) every 2 weeks plus oral apatinib 250 mg daily. The primary endpoint was objective response rate (ORR) assessed by an independent review committee (IRC) per RECIST v1.1. RESULTS: Seventy patients in the first-line setting and 120 patients in the second-line setting were enrolled. As of January 10, 2020, the ORR was 34.3% [24/70; 95% confidence interval (CI), 23.3-46.6] in the first-line and 22.5% (27/120; 95% CI, 15.4-31.0) in the second-line cohort per IRC. Median progression-free survival in both cohorts was 5.7 months (95% CI, 5.4-7.4) and 5.5 months (95% CI, 3.7-5.6), respectively. The 12-month survival rate was 74.7% (95% CI, 62.5-83.5) and 68.2% (95% CI, 59.0-75.7), respectively.

Such imaging probes could be used to predict early response to cancer immunotherapy, help select effective single or combination immunotherapies, and facilitate the development of new immunotherapies or immunotherapy combinations. This study was designed to optimize conditions for performing CD8 PET imaging with (89)Zr-Df-IAB22M2C and determine whether CD8 PET imaging could provide a safe and effective noninvasive method of visualizing the whole-body biodistribution of CD8+ leukocytes. Methods: We conducted a phase 1 first-in-humans PET imaging study using an anti-CD8 radiolabeled minibody, (89)Zr-Df-IAB22M2C, to detect whole-body and tumor CD8+ leukocyte distribution in patients with metastatic solid tumors. Patients received 111 MBq of (89)Zr-Df-IAB22M2C followed by serial PET scanning over 5-7 d. A 2-stage design included a dose-escalation phase and a dose-expansion phase. Biodistribution, radiation dosimetry, and semiquantitative evaluation of (89)Zr-Df-IAB22M2C uptake were performed in all patients. Results: Fifteen subjects with metastatic melanoma, non-small cell lung cancer, and hepatocellular carcinoma were enrolled. No drug-related adverse events or abnormal laboratory results were noted except for a transient increase in antidrug antibodies in 1 subject. (89)Zr-Df-IAB22M2C accumulated in tumors and CD8-rich tissues (e.g., spleen, bone marrow, nodes), with maximum uptake at 24-48 h after injection and low background activity in CD8-poor tissues (e.g., muscle and lung).

36,Laparoscopic liver resection versus radiofrequency ablation for small hepatocellular carcinoma: randomized clinical trial.,10.1093/bjs/znae099,"BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to compare the efficacy of laparoscopic liver resection versus radiofrequency ablation for treatment of small hepatocellular carcinoma. METHODS: This single-centre RCT was conducted at a tertiary referral centre in China. Patients with small hepatocellular carcinoma who had a single nodule no larger than 5 cm, or up to three nodules of 3 cm or smaller, were eligible. Patients were assigned randomly in a 1 : 1 ratio to either laparoscopic liver resection or radiofrequency ablation. Blinding was not attempted. Sample size calculations led to 75 patients per group. The primary outcome was overall survival, and the secondary outcome was recurrence-free survival. RESULTS: Seventy-five patients were included in each group. Overall survival (HR 1.26, 95% c.i. 0.69 to 2.30; P = 0.451) and recurrence-free survival (HR 1.34, 0.86 to 2.08; P = 0.189) did not differ between the resection and ablation groups. The 1-, 3- and 5-year overall survival rates were 94.7, 80.0, and 74.7% respectively after laparoscopic liver resection versus 93.3, 78.7, and 67.9% after radiofrequency ablation. Corresponding recurrence-free survival rates were 78.7, 61.3, and 51.6%, and 69.3, 53.3, and 41.0%, respectively. CONCLUSION: For small hepatocellular carcinoma, percutaneous radiofrequency ablation provides therapeutic effects similar to those of laparoscopic liver resection.

Here, we present 5-year results from this cohort. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients were randomized 1 : 1 : 1 to arm A [nivolumab 1 mg/kg plus ipilimumab 3 mg/kg Q3W (four doses)] or arm B [nivolumab 3 mg/kg plus ipilimumab 1 mg/kg Q3W (four doses)], each followed by nivolumab 240 mg Q2W, or arm C (nivolumab 3 mg/kg Q2W plus ipilimumab 1 mg/kg Q6W). The primary objectives were safety, tolerability, investigator-assessed objective response rate (ORR), and duration of response (DOR) per RECIST version 1.1. RESULTS: A total of 148 patients were randomized across treatment arms. At 60-month minimum follow-up (62.6-month median follow-up), the ORR was 34% (n = 17), 27% (n = 13), and 29% (n = 14) in arms A, B, and C, respectively. The median DOR was 51.2 months [95% confidence interval (CI) 12.6 months-not estimable (NE)], 15.2 months (95% CI 7.1 months-NE), and 21.7 months (95% CI 4.2 months-NE), respectively.

OBJECTIVE: To investigate the feasibility of SBRT before deceased donor liver transplant (DDLT) for previously untreated unresectable HCC. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: In this phase 2 nonrandomized controlled trial conducted between June 1, 2015, and October 18, 2019, 32 eligible patients within UCSF (University of California, San Francisco) criteria underwent dual-tracer (18F-fluorodeoxyglucose and 11C-acetate [ACC]) positron emission tomography with computed tomography (PET-CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with gadoxetate followed by SBRT of 35 to 50 Gy in 5 fractions, and the same imaging afterward while awaiting DDLT. Statistical analysis was performed on an intention-to-treat basis between October 1 and 31, 2023. INTERVENTION: Patients received SBRT followed by DDLT when matched deceased donor grafts were available. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Coprimary end points were progression-free survival (PFS) and objective response rates (ORRs) by the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors, version 1.1 (RECIST 1.1), modified RECIST (mRECIST), and PET Response Criteria in Solid Tumors (PERCIST). Secondary end points were local control rate, overall survival (OS), and safety. RESULTS: A total of 32 patients (median age, 59 years [IQR, 54-63 years]; 22 men [68.8%]) with 56 lesions received SBRT. After a median follow-up of 74.6 months (IQR, 40.1-102.9 months), the median PFS was 17.6 months (95% CI, 6.6-28.6 months), and the median OS was 60.5 months (95% CI, 29.7-91.2 months). The 5-year PFS was 39.9% (95% CI, 19.9%-59.9%), and the 5-year OS was 51.3% (95% CI, 31.7%-70.9%).

39,Dissecting Intra-Tumoral Changes Following Immune Checkpoint Blockades in Intrahepatic Cholangiocarcinoma via Single-Cell Analysis.,10.3389/fimmu.2022.871769,"PURPOSE: To dissect the tumor ecosystem following immune checkpoint blockades (ICBs) in intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC) at a single-cell level. METHODS: Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data of 10 ICC patients for the ICB clinical trial were extracted from GSE125449 and systematically reanalyzed. Bulk RNA-seq data of 255 ICC patients were analyzed. Infiltration levels of SPP1(+)CD68(+) tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) were examined by dual immunofluorescence (IF) staining in 264 resected ICC samples. The correlation between SPP1(+) TAMs and clinicopathological features as well as their prognostic significance was evaluated. RESULTS: Among the 10 patients, five received biopsy at baseline, and others were biopsied at different timings following ICBs. Single-cell transcriptomes for 5,931 cells were obtained. A tighter cellular communication network was observed in ICB-treated ICC. We found a newly emerging VEGF signaling mediated by PGF-VEGFR1 between cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) and endothelial cells in ICC following ICBs. SPP1 expression was dramatically upregulated, and SPP1(+) TAM gene signatures were enriched in TAMs receiving ICB therapy. We also identified SPP1(+) TAMs as an independent adverse prognostic indicator for survival in ICC. CONCLUSION: Our analyses provide an overview of the altered tumor ecosystem in ICC treated with ICBs and highlight the potential role of targeting CAFs and SPP1(+)TAMs in developing a more rational checkpoint blockade-based therapy for ICC.",Sun BY; Zhou C; Guan RY; Liu G; Yang ZF; Wang ZT; Gan W; Zhou J; Fan J; Yi Y; Qiu SJ,False,No comparison group specified and not a randomized controlled trial.,patients with intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma,immune checkpoint blockades,not specified,"tumor ecosystem analysis, prognostic significance of SPP1(+) TAMs",single-cell RNA sequencing analysis,False,"Model A's decision is correct.

This phase II trial was conducted to prospectively investigate the efficacy and safety of lenvatinib, sintilimab (a PD-1 inhibitor) plus TACE (Len-Sin-TACE) in patients with advanced stage HCC. METHODS: This was a single-arm phase II trial. Patients with BCLC stage C HCC were recruited. They received lenvatinib (bodyweight ≥60 kg, 12 mg; bodyweight <60 kg, 8 mg) orally once daily, sintilimab (200 mg) intravenously once every 3 weeks, and on demand TACE. The primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS) per mRECIST. RESULTS: Thirty patients were enrolled. The primary endpoint was met with a median PFS of 8.0 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 6.1-9.8) months per mRECIST, which was the same as that per RECIST 1.1. The objective response rate was 60.0% per mRECIST and 30.0% per RECIST 1.1. The disease control rate was 86.7% per mRECIST/RECIST 1.1. The median duration of response was 7.4 (95% CI: 6.6-8.2) months per mRECIST (n = 18) and 4.3 (95% CI: 4.0-4.6) months per RECIST 1.1 (n = 9).

41,Patient-Reported Outcomes From the Phase III HIMALAYA Study of Tremelimumab Plus Durvalumab in Unresectable Hepatocellular Carcinoma.,10.1200/JCO.23.01462,"PURPOSE: In the phase III HIMALAYA study (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT03298451) in unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (uHCC), the Single Tremelimumab Regular Interval Durvalumab (STRIDE) regimen significantly improved overall survival versus sorafenib, and durvalumab monotherapy was noninferior to sorafenib. Patient-reported outcomes (PROs), a secondary outcome from HIMALAYA, are reported here. METHODS: Participants were randomly assigned to receive STRIDE, durvalumab, or sorafenib. PROs were assessed (preplanned secondary outcome) using the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer 30-item Quality of Life Questionnaire and the 18-item HCC module. Time to deterioration (TTD), change from baseline and improvement rate in global health status/quality of life (GHS/QoL), functioning, and disease-related symptoms were analyzed. RESULTS: In total, 1,171 participants were randomly assigned to STRIDE (n = 393), durvalumab (n = 389), or sorafenib (n = 389) and were evaluable for PRO assessments. Across treatment arms, compliance rates for PROs were >77% at baseline and >70% overall. Baseline scores were comparable across treatment arms. TTD in GHS/QoL, physical functioning, fatigue, appetite loss, and abdominal pain was numerically longer for both STRIDE and durvalumab versus sorafenib. Clinically meaningful deterioration in PROs was not observed in any treatment arm. However, TTD in nausea and abdominal swelling was numerically longer for STRIDE versus sorafenib, and the likelihood of clinically meaningful improvement in GHS/QoL, role, emotional and social functioning, and disease-related symptoms was greater with STRIDE and durvalumab versus sorafenib. PROs with STRIDE and durvalumab were generally similar. CONCLUSION: Compared with sorafenib, STRIDE and durvalumab were associated with clinically meaningful, patient-centered GHS/QoL, functioning, and symptom benefits in people with uHCC.

42,Contrast-enhanced US Evaluation of Hepatocellular Carcinoma Response to Chemoembolization: A Prospective Multicenter Trial.,10.1148/radiol.230727,"Background Contrast-enhanced (CE) US has been studied for use in the detection of residual viable hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) after locoregional therapy, but multicenter data are lacking. Purpose To compare two-dimensional (2D) and three-dimensional (3D) CE US diagnostic performance with that of CE MRI or CT, the current clinical standard, in the detection of residual viable HCC after transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) in a prospective multicenter trial. Materials and Methods Participants aged at least 21 years with US-visible HCC scheduled for TACE were consecutively enrolled at one of three participating academic medical centers from May 2016 to March 2022. Each underwent baseline 2D and 3D CE US before TACE, 2D and 3D CE US 1-2 weeks and/or 4-6 weeks after TACE, and CE MRI or CT 4-6 weeks after TACE. CE US and CE MRI or CT were evaluated by three fellowship-trained radiologists for the presence or absence of viable tumors and were compared with reference standards of pathology (18%), angiography on re-treatment after identification of residual disease at 1-2-month follow-up imaging (31%), 4-8-month CE MRI or CT (42%), or short-term (approximately 1-2 months) CE MRI or CT if clinically decompensated and estimated viability was greater than 50% at imaging (9%). Diagnostic performance criteria, including sensitivity and specificity, were obtained for each modality and time point with generalized estimating equation analysis. Results A total of 132 participants were included (mean age, 64 years ± 7 [SD], 87 male). Sensitivity of 2D CE US 4-6 weeks after TACE was 91% (95% CI: 84, 95), which was higher than that of CE MRI or CT (68%; 95% CI: 58, 76; P < .001). Sensitivity of 3D CE US 4-6 weeks after TACE was 89% (95% CI: 81, 94), which was higher than that of CE MRI or CT (P < .001), with no evidence of a difference from 2D CE US (P = .22). CE MRI or CT had 85% (95% CI: 76, 91) specificity, higher than that of 4-6-week 2D and 3D CE US (70% [95% CI: 56, 80] and 67% [95% CI: 53, 78], respectively; P = .046 and P = .023, respectively). No evidence of differences in any diagnostic criteria were observed between 1-2-week and 4-6-week 2D CE US (P > .21). Conclusion The 2D and 3D CE US examinations 4-6 weeks after TACE revealed higher sensitivity in the detection of residual HCC than CE MRI or CT, albeit with lower specificity.

43,Adjuvant Transarterial Chemoembolization With Sorafenib for Portal Vein Tumor Thrombus: A Randomized Clinical Trial.,10.1001/jamasurg.2024.0506,"IMPORTANCE: Certain patients with hepatocellular carcinoma with portal vein tumor thrombus could benefit from surgical resection, and postoperative adjuvant therapy may lower the incidence of tumor recurrence. OBJECTIVE: To compare the efficacy and safety of sorafenib plus transarterial chemoembolization vs sorafenib alone as postoperative adjuvant therapy for patients with hepatocellular carcinoma with portal vein tumor thrombus. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This was a phase 3, multicenter, randomized clinical trial conducted in 5 hospitals in China. A total of 158 patients were enrolled and randomized from October 2019 to March 2022, with a median follow-up of 28.4 months. Portal vein tumor thrombus was graded by the Cheng classification. Eligible patients with hepatocellular carcinoma with Cheng grade I to III portal vein tumor thrombus (ie, involving segmental or sectoral branches, right- or left-side branch, or main trunk of portal vein) were included. INTERVENTIONS: Patients were randomly assigned 1:1 to receive transarterial chemoembolization with sorafenib or sorafenib alone as postoperative adjuvant therapy. Sorafenib treatment was started within 3 days after randomization, with an initial dose of 400 mg orally twice a day. In the transarterial chemoembolization with sorafenib group, transarterial chemoembolization was performed 1 day after the first administration of sorafenib. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary end point was recurrence-free survival. Efficacy was assessed in the intention-to-treat population and safety was assessed in patients who received at least 1 dose of study treatment. RESULTS: Of 158 patients included, the median (IQR) age was 54 (43-61) years, and 140 (88.6%) patients were male. The median (IQR) recurrence-free survival was significantly longer in the transarterial chemoembolization with sorafenib group (16.8 [12.0-NA] vs 12.6 [7.8-18.1] months; hazard ratio [HR], 0.57; 95% CI, 0.39-0.83; P = .002). The median (IQR) overall survival was also significantly longer with transarterial chemoembolization with sorafenib than with sorafenib alone (30.4 [20.6-NA] vs 22.5 [15.4-NA] months; HR, 0.57; 95% CI, 0.36-0.91; P = .02). The most common grade 3/4 adverse event was hand-foot syndrome (23 of 79 patients in the transarterial chemoembolization with sorafenib group [29.1%] vs 24 of 79 patients in the sorafenib alone group [30.4%]). There were no treatment-related deaths in either group. The transarterial chemoembolization with sorafenib group did not show additional toxicity compared with the sorafenib monotherapy group. CONCLUSION AND RELEVANCE: In this study, the combination of sorafenib and transarterial chemoembolization as postoperative adjuvant therapy in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma with portal vein tumor thrombus resulted in longer recurrence-free survival and overall survival than sorafenib alone and was well tolerated.

44,Proton beam radiotherapy versus transarterial chemoembolization for hepatocellular carcinoma: Results of a randomized clinical trial.,10.1002/cncr.34965,"BACKGROUND: This study compares survival rates, recurrence patterns, toxicity, and treatment cost in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) treated with either transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) or proton beam radiotherapy (PBT). METHODS: Subjects with untreated HCC meeting Milan or San Francisco transplant criteria were recruited. Subjects were randomized to receive PBT (n = 36) or TACE (n = 40). Proton therapy was administered in 15 fractions over 3 weeks to a total dose of 70.2 Gy. TACE was repeated until complete or maximal response. The primary outcome measure was overall survival (OS). Secondary end points were progression-free survival (PFS), local control (LC), toxicity, and cost. RESULTS: Of the 76 randomized patients, 74 were assessed for outcome measures. The 2-year OS for PBT versus TACE was similar at 68%, 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.54-0.86, and 65%, 95% CI, 0.52-0.83 (p = .80), however, median PFS was improved for PBT versus TACE (not reached vs. 12 months, p = .002). LC was improved with PBT versus TACE (hazard ratio, 5.64; 95% CI, 1.78-17.9, p = .003). Days of posttreatment hospitalization were 24 for PBT and 166 for TACE (p < .001). Total mean cost per patient for treatment and posttreatment care revealed a 28% cost savings for PBT. CONCLUSIONS: PBT and TACE yielded similar OS for treatment of HCC, but PFS and LC were improved with PBT compared to TACE. Patients treated with PBT required fewer courses of treatment, fewer posttreatment hospitalization days, and reduced cost of treatment compared to TACE. These data support the use of PBT as a viable treatment alternative to TACE for patients with HCC within transplant criteria.

This trial evaluated the effectiveness and safety of DEB-TACE using small-size (≤ 100 μm) microspheres loaded with epirubicin. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This prospective, single-arm, multicenter study enrolled patients diagnosed with HCC who underwent DEB-TACE using 40 (range, 30-50), 75 (range, 60-90), or 100 (range, 75-125) μm epirubicin-loaded microspheres (TANDEM microspheres, Varian Medical). Bead size was at the discretion of treating physicians and based on tumor size and/or vascular structure. The primary outcome measure was 6-month objective response rate (ORR). Secondary outcome measures were 30-day and 3-month ORR, time to tumor progression and extrahepatic spread, proportion of progression-free survival and overall survival (OS) at one year, and incidence of treatment-associated adverse events. RESULTS: Data from 108 patients from ten centers was analyzed. Six-month ORR was 73.3 and 71.3% based on European association for the study of the liver (EASL) and modified response evaluation criteria in solid tumors (mRECIST) criteria, respectively. Thirty-day ORR was 79.6% for both EASL and mRECIST criteria with 3-month ORR being 80.0 and 81.0%, respectively, for each criteria. One-year PPF and OS rate were 60.3 and 94.3%. There was a total of 30 SAEs reported to be likely to definitely associated with microsphere (n = 9), epirubicin (n = 9), or procedure (n = 12) with none resulting in death.

PETAL evaluated safety, preliminary activity of TACE plus pembrolizumab and explored mechanisms of efficacy. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients with liver-confined hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) were planned to receive up to two rounds of TACE followed by pembrolizumab 200 mg every 21 days commencing 30 days post-TACE until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity for up to 1 year. Primary endpoint was safety, with assessment window of 21 days from pembrolizumab initiation. Secondary endpoints included progression-free survival (PFS) and evaluation of tumor and host determinants of response. RESULTS: Fifteen patients were included in the safety and efficacy population: 73% had nonviral cirrhosis; median age was 72 years. Child-Pugh class was A in 14 patients. Median tumor size was 4 cm. Ten patients (67%) received pembrolizumab after one TACE; 5 patients after two (33%). Pembrolizumab yielded no synergistic toxicity nor dose-limiting toxicities post-TACE. Treatment-related adverse events occurred in 93% of patients, most commonly skin rash (40%), fatigue, and diarrhea (27%). After a median follow-up of 38.5 months, objective response rate 12 weeks post-TACE was 53%.

47,"Phase I/II Multicenter Trial of a Novel Therapeutic Cancer Vaccine, HepaVac-101, for Hepatocellular Carcinoma.",10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-21-4424,"PURPOSE: Immunotherapy for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) shows considerable promise in improving clinical outcomes. HepaVac-101 represents a single-arm, first-in-human phase I/II multicenter cancer vaccine trial for HCC (NCT03203005). It combines multipeptide antigens (IMA970A) with the TLR7/8/RIG I agonist CV8102. IMA970A includes 5 HLA-A*24 and 7 HLA-A*02 as well as 4 HLA-DR restricted peptides selected after mass spectrometric identification in human HCC tissues or cell lines. CV8102 is an RNA-based immunostimulator inducing a balanced Th1/Th2 immune response. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 82 patients with very early- to intermediate-stage HCCs were enrolled and screened for suitable HLA haplotypes and 22 put on study treatment. This consisted in a single infusion of low-dose cyclophosphamide followed by nine intradermal coadministrations of IMA970A and CV8102. Only patients with no disease relapse after standard-of-care treatments were vaccinated. The primary endpoints of the HepaVac-101 clinical trial were safety, tolerability, and antigen-specific T-cell responses. Secondary or exploratory endpoints included additional immunologic parameters and survival endpoints. RESULTS: The vaccination showed a good safety profile. Transient mild-to-moderate injection-site reactions were the most frequent IMA970A/CV8102-related side effects. Immune responses against ≥1 vaccinated HLA class I tumor-associated peptide (TAA) and ≥1 vaccinated HLA class II TAA were respectively induced in 37% and 53% of the vaccinees. CONCLUSIONS: Immunotherapy may provide a great improvement in treatment options for HCC.

48,A multimodal atlas of hepatocellular carcinoma reveals convergent evolutionary paths and 'bad apple' effect on clinical trajectory.,10.1016/j.jhep.2024.05.017,"BACKGROUND & AIMS: Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a highly fatal cancer characterized by high intra-tumor heterogeneity (ITH). A panoramic understanding of its tumor evolution, in relation to its clinical trajectory, may provide novel prognostic and treatment strategies. METHODS: Through the Asia-Pacific Hepatocellular Carcinoma trials group (NCT03267641), we recruited one of the largest prospective cohorts of patients with HCC, with over 600 whole genome and transcriptome samples from 123 treatment-naïve patients. RESULTS: Using a multi-region sampling approach, we revealed seven convergent genetic evolutionary paths governed by the early driver mutations, late copy number variations and viral integrations, which stratify patient clinical trajectories after surgical resection. Furthermore, such evolutionary paths shaped the molecular profiles, leading to distinct transcriptomic subtypes. Most significantly, although we found the coexistence of multiple transcriptomic subtypes within certain tumors, patient prognosis was best predicted by the most aggressive cell fraction of the tumor, rather than by overall degree of transcriptomic ITH level - a phenomenon we termed the 'bad apple' effect. Finally, we found that characteristics throughout early and late tumor evolution provide significant and complementary prognostic power in predicting patient survival. CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, our study generated a comprehensive landscape of evolutionary history for HCC and provides a rich multi-omics resource for understanding tumor heterogeneity and clinical trajectories. IMPACT AND IMPLICATIONS: This prospective study, utilizing comprehensive multi-sector, multi-omics sequencing and clinical data from surgically resected hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), reveals critical insights into the role of tumor evolution and intra-tumor heterogeneity (ITH) in determining the prognosis of HCC. These findings are invaluable for oncology researchers and clinicians, as they underscore the influence of distinct evolutionary paths and the 'bad apple' effect, where the most aggressive tumor fraction dictates disease progression. These insights not only enhance prognostic accuracy post-surgical resection but also pave the way for personalized treatment strategies tailored to specific tumor evolutionary and transcriptomic profiles. The coexistence of multiple subtypes within the same tumor prompts a re-appraisal of the utilities of depending on single samples to represent the entire tumor and suggests the need for clinical molecular imaging. This research thus marks a significant step forward in the clinical understanding and management of HCC, underscoring the importance of integrating tumor evolutionary dynamics and multi-omics biomarkers into therapeutic decision-making.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this prospective trial, 50 patients with HCC were randomly assigned to MWA or RFA treatment. MRI was performed 24 h before and after ablation and subsequently in 3-month intervals. Ablation volumes, ablation durations, adverse events (AE), technique efficacy, technical success, local tumor progression (LTP), disease-free survival (DFS), intrahepatic distant recurrence (IDR), and overall survival (OS) rates were evaluated. RESULTS: The mean ablation volume was 66.5 cm³ for MWA and 29.2  cm³ for RFA (p < 0.01). The mean ablation durations for MWA and RFA were 11.2 ± 4.0 min and 16.3 ± 4.7 min, respectively (p < 0.01). Six mild AEs were documented (p > 0.05). All treatments had a technical success rate and a technique efficacy rate of 100 % (50/50, p = 1.00). LTP within 2 years occurred in 1/25 (4 %) in the MWA group and in 4/25 (16 %) in the RFA group (p = 0.06). IDR within 2 years was 8/25 (32 %) for MWA and 14/25 (56 %) for RFA (p < 0.05). The median DFS was 24.5 months and 13.4 months for MWA and RFA, respectively (p = 0.02). The 1-, 2-, 3-year OS rates were 100 %, 80 %, 72 % in the MWA group and 72 %, 64 %, 60 % in the RFA group, respectively (p ≥ 0.14). CONCLUSION: The clinical outcome after MWA or RFA for HCC treatment was very similar with no significant differences in LTP or OS. However, MWA shows a trend toward better DFS with fewer IDRs than RFA. KEY POINTS: · MWA allows for larger ablation volumes and a shorter treatment duration compared to RFA in patients with HCC.. · MWA shows a trend toward better disease-free survival and fewer intrahepatic distant recurrences compared to RFA.. · The three-year survival rates show no significant difference between the two methods..",Vogl TJ; Martin SS; Gruber-Rouh T; Booz C; Koch V; Nour-Eldin NA; Hussainy Said MN,True,Matches all PICOS criteria,patients with small- and medium-sized HCC,microwave ablation,radiofrequency ablation,"local tumor progression, disease-free survival, overall survival",prospective trial,True,"Model A's decision is correct.

Targeting membranous phosphatidylserine may induce pro-inflammatory and -immune stimulating effects that enhance immunotherapy activity. This hypothesis was tested in a single-arm phase 2 trial evaluating frontline bavituximab, a phosphatidylserine targeting antibody, plus pembrolizumab (anti-PD-1) in patients with unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (NCT03519997). The primary endpoint was investigator-assessed objective response rate among evaluable patients, and secondary end points included progression-free survival, incidence of adverse events, overall survival, and duration of response. Among 28 evaluable patients, the confirmed response rate was 32.1%, which met the pre-specified endpoint, and the median progression-free survival was 6.3 months (95% CI, 1.3-11.3 months). Treatment related-adverse events of any grade occurred in 45.7% of patients, with grade 3 or greater adverse events in 14.3% of patients. Adverse events of any cause were observed in 33 patients (94.3%), with grade 3 or greater adverse events in 11 patients (31.4%). Prespecified exploratory analyses of baseline tumor specimens showed that a depletion of B cells, and the presence of fibrotic tissue and expression of immune checkpoints in stroma was associated with tumor response.

The aim of this study was to report the results of acquired experience in a tertiary center for all unresectable HCCs. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective, observational study using data collected from consecutive patients undergoing SIRT between October 2013 and June 2020. DS was considered achieved when a curative treatment could be proposed 6 months after SIRT. RESULTS: One hundred twenty-seven patients were included (male = 90%, 64 ± 11 y), of whom 112 (n = 88%) had cirrhosis. HCC was classified as BCLC stage C in 64 patients (50%), with a median diameter of 61 mm, an infiltrative pattern in 51 patients (40%), and portal vein invasion in 62 (49%) patients. Fifty patients (39%) achieved DS 6 months following SIRT, with 29 of them (23%) undergoing curative treatment in a median time of 4.3 months: 17 (13%) were transplanted, 11 (85%) had liver resection, and 1 patient had a radiofrequency ablation. The median overall survival of patients with or without DS was 51 versus 10 months, respectively (p < 0.001). In patients who achieved DS, progression-free survival was higher in patients who underwent surgery: 47 versus 11 months (p < 0.001). Four variables were independently associated with DS: age (OR: 0.96, 95% CI: [0.92, 0.99]; p = 0.032), baseline α-fetoprotein (OR: 1.00, 95% CI: [1.00, 1.00]; p = 0.034), HCC distribution (OR: 0.3, 95% CI: [0.11, 0.75]; p = 0.012), and ALBI grade (OR: 0.34. 95% CI: [0.14, 0.80]; p = 0.014).

METHODS AND MATERIALS: Patients were included if they were eligible for TACE. They could also be recruited if they required treatment prior to liver transplantation. A maximum of four TACE-DEB procedures and ablation after incomplete TACE-DEB were both allowed. SBRT was delivered in six fractions of 8-9Gy. Primary end point was time to progression (TTP). Secondary endpoints were local control (LC), overall survival (OS), response rate (RR), toxicity, and quality of life (QoL). The calculated sample size was 100 patients. RESULTS: Between May 2015 and April 2020, 30 patients were randomized to the study. Due to slow accrual the trial was closed prematurely. Two patients in the SBRT arm were considered ineligible leaving 16 patients in the TACE-DEB arm and 12 in the SBRT arm. Median follow-up was 28.1 months. Median TTP was 12 months for TACEDEB and 19 months for SBRT (p=0.15). Median LC was 12 months for TACE-DEB and >40 months (not reached) for SBRT (p=0.075). Median OS was 36.8 months for TACEDEB and 44.1 months for SBRT (p=0.36). A post-hoc analysis showed 100% for SBRT 1- and 2-year LC, and 54.4% and 43.6% for TACE-DEB (p=0.019). Both treatments resulted in RR>80%. Three episodes of possibly related toxicity grade ≥3 were observed after TACE-DEB. No episodes were observed after SBRT. QoL remained stable after both treatment arms. CONCLUSIONS: In this trial, TTP after TACE-DEB was not significantly improved by SBRT, while SBRT showed higher local antitumoral activity than TACE-DEB, without detrimental effects on OS, toxicity and QoL.

54,Adjuvant immunotherapy improves recurrence-free and overall survival following surgical resection for intermediate/advanced hepatocellular carcinoma a multicenter propensity matching analysis.,10.3389/fimmu.2023.1322233,"BACKGROUND & AIMS: The effectiveness of adjuvant immunotherapy to diminish recurrence and improve long-term prognosis following curative-intent surgical resection for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is of increased interest, especially among individuals at high risk of recurrence. The objective of the current study was to investigate the impact of adjuvant immunotherapy on long-term recurrence and survival after curative resection among patients with intermediate/advanced HCC. METHODS: Using a prospectively-collected multicenter database, patients who underwent curative-intent resection for Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC) stage B/C HCC were identified. Propensity score matching (PSM) analysis was used to compare recurrence-free survival (RFS) and overall survival (OS) between patients treated with and without adjuvant immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs). Multivariate Cox-regression analysis further identified independent factors of RFS and OS. RESULTS: Among the 627 enrolled patients, 109 patients (23.3%) received adjuvant immunotherapy. Most ICI-related adverse reactions were grading I-II. PSM analysis created 99 matched pairs of patients with comparable baseline characteristics between patients treated with and without adjuvant immunotherapy. In the PSM cohort, the median RFS (29.6 vs. 19.3 months, P=0.031) and OS (35.1 vs. 27.8 months, P=0.036) were better among patients who received adjuvant immunotherapy versus patients who did not. After adjustment for other confounding factors on multivariable analyzes, adjuvant immunotherapy remained independently associated with favorable RFS (HR: 0.630; 95% CI: 0.435-0.914; P=0.015) and OS (HR: 0.601; 95% CI: 0.401-0.898; P=0.013). Subgroup analyzes identified potentially prognostic benefits of adjuvant immunotherapy among patients with intermediate-stage and advanced-stage HCC. CONCLUSION: This real-world observational study demonstrated that adjuvant immunotherapy was associated with improved RFS and OS following curative-intent resection of intermediate/advanced HCC.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: NASIR-HCC is a single-arm, multicenter, open-label, phase 2 trial that recruited from 2017 to 2019 patients who were naïve to immunotherapy and had tumors in the BCLC B2 substage (single or multiple tumors beyond the up-to-7 rule), or unilobar tumors with segmental or lobar portal vein invasion (PVI); no extrahepatic spread; and preserved liver function. Patients received SIRT followed 3 weeks later by nivolumab (240 mg every 2 weeks) for up to 24 doses or until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Safety was the primary endpoint. Secondary objectives included objective response rate (ORR), time to progression (TTP), and overall survival (OS). RESULTS: 42 patients received SIRT (31 BCLC-B2, 11 with PVI) and were followed for a median of 22.2 months. 27 patients discontinued and 1 never received Nivolumab. 41 patients had any-grade adverse events (AE) and 21 had serious AEs (SAE). Treatment-related AEs and SAEs grade 3-4 occurred in 8 and 5 patients, respectively. Using RECIST 1.1 criteria, ORR reported by investigators was 41.5% (95% CI 26.3% to 57.9%).

Many patients with early-stage HCC do not receive curative-intent therapies. Stereotactic ablative body radiotherapy (SABR) has emerged as an effective, non-invasive HCC treatment option, however, randomized evidence for SABR in the first line setting is lacking. METHODS: Trans-Tasman Radiation Oncology Group (TROG) 21.07 SOCRATES-HCC is a phase II, prospective, randomised trial comparing SABR to other current standard of care therapies for patients with a solitary HCC ≤ 8 cm, ineligible for surgical resection or transplantation. The study is divided into 2 cohorts. Cohort 1 will compromise 118 patients with tumors ≤ 3 cm eligible for thermal ablation randomly assigned (1:1 ratio) to thermal ablation or SABR. Cohort 2 will comprise 100 patients with tumors > 3 cm up to 8 cm in size, or tumors ≤ 3 cm ineligible for thermal ablation, randomly assigned (1:1 ratio) to SABR or best other standard of care therapy including transarterial therapies. The primary objective is to determine whether SABR results in superior freedom from local progression (FFLP) at 2 years compared to thermal ablation in cohort 1 and compared to best standard of care therapy in cohort 2. Secondary endpoints include progression free survival, overall survival, adverse events, patient reported outcomes and health economic analyses. DISCUSSION: The SOCRATES-HCC study will provide the first randomized, multicentre evaluation of the efficacy, safety and cost effectiveness of SABR versus other standard of care therapies in the first line treatment of unresectable, early-stage HCC.

57,The utility of P-I-R classification in predicting the on-treatment histological and clinical outcomes of patients with hepatitis B and advanced liver fibrosis.,10.1097/HEP.0000000000000563,"BACKGROUND AND AIMS: The predominantly progressive, indeterminate, and predominantly regressive (P-I-R) classification extends beyond staging and provides information on dynamic changes of liver fibrosis. However, the prognostic implication of P-I-R classification is not elucidated. Therefore, in the present research, we investigated the utility of P-I-R classification in predicting the on-treatment clinical outcomes. APPROACH AND RESULTS: In an extension study on a randomized controlled trial, we originally enrolled 1000 patients with chronic hepatitis B and biopsy-proven histological significant fibrosis, and treated them for more than 7 years with entecavir-based therapy. Among the 727 patients with a second biopsy at treatment week 72, we compared P-I-R classification and Ishak score changes in 646 patients with adequate liver sections for the histological evaluation. Progressive, indeterminate, and regressive cases were observed in 70%, 17%, and 13% of patients before treatments and 20%, 14%, and 64% after 72-week treatment, respectively, which could further differentiate the histological outcomes of patients with stable Ishak scores. The 7-year cumulative incidence of HCC was 1.5% for the regressive cases, 4.3% for the indeterminate cases, and 22.8% for the progressive cases ( p <0.001). After adjusting for age, treatment regimen, platelet counts, cirrhosis, Ishak fibrosis score changes, and Laennec staging, the posttreatment progressive had a HR of 17.77 (vs. posttreatment regressive; 95% CI: 5.55-56.88) for the incidence of liver-related events (decompensation, HCC, and death/liver transplantation).

60,Serum MYCN as a predictive biomarker of prognosis and therapeutic response in the prevention of hepatocellular carcinoma recurrence.,10.1002/ijc.34893,"The proto-oncogene MYCN expression marked a cancer stem-like cell population in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and served as a therapeutic target of acyclic retinoid (ACR), an orally administered vitamin A derivative that has demonstrated promising efficacy and safety in reducing HCC recurrence. This study investigated the role of MYCN as a predictive biomarker for therapeutic response to ACR and prognosis of HCC. MYCN gene expression in HCC was analyzed in the Cancer Genome Atlas and a Taiwanese cohort (N = 118). Serum MYCN protein levels were assessed in healthy controls (N = 15), patients with HCC (N = 116), pre- and post-surgical patients with HCC (N = 20), and a subset of patients from a phase 3 clinical trial of ACR (N = 68, NCT01640808). The results showed increased MYCN gene expression in HCC tumors, which positively correlated with HCC recurrence in non-cirrhotic or single-tumor patients. Serum MYCN protein levels were higher in patients with HCC, decreased after surgical resection of HCC, and were associated with liver functional reserve and fibrosis markers, as well as long-term HCC prognosis (>4 years). Subgroup analysis of a phase 3 clinical trial of ACR identified serum MYCN as the risk factor most strongly associated with HCC recurrence. Patients with HCC with higher serum MYCN levels after a 4-week treatment of ACR exhibited a significantly higher risk of recurrence (hazard ratio 3.27; p = .022). In conclusion, serum MYCN holds promise for biomarker-based precision medicine for the prevention of HCC, long-term prognosis of early-stage HCC, and identification of high-response subgroups for ACR-based treatment.

SAFFRON-104 (NCT03941873) was a multicohort phase Ib/II study investigating sitravatinib with/without tislelizumab, an anti-programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) antibody, in patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) or gastric cancer/gastroesophageal junction cancer (GC/GEJC). METHODS: Eligible patients had histologically/cytologically confirmed advanced HCC or GC/GEJC. Phase I determined the recommended phase II dose (RP2D) of sitravatinib with/without tislelizumab. Phase II evaluated sitravatinib monotherapy in patients with pretreated HCC, and sitravatinib plus tislelizumab in anti-PD-(L)1-naïve or -treated HCC and anti-PD-(L)1-naïve GC/GEJC. Primary endpoints were safety/tolerability (phase I) and objective response rate (ORR) (phase II). RESULTS: At data cutoff (March 31, 2023), 111 patients were enrolled; 102 were efficacy-evaluable (median study follow-up 9.1 months [range: 0.7-36.9]). The RP2D of sitravatinib was determined as 120 mg orally once daily.

62,Efficacy and outcome of molecular targeted therapies in elderly patients with hepatocellular carcinoma: Relative dose intensity associated with overall survival.,10.1002/cam4.6783,"AIM: Indications of drug therapies to elderly patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) should be carefully determined. The current study assessed the safety and efficacy of molecular targeted agents (MTAs) in the elderly patients with HCC, and identified factors associated with prognosis in a real-world clinical setting. METHODS: In a retrospective observational study, clinical data of patients with unresectable HCC treated with sorafenib or lenvatinib as first-line treatment at our hospital between 2011 and 2022, were investigated. Clinical parameters, therapeutic effects, adverse events (AEs), and prognosis were evaluated separately for the non-elderly (<75 years old) and elderly patients (≥75 years old). RESULTS: Overall, 111 patients were enrolled, including 59 non-elderly and 52 elderly patients. Compared to the non-elderly patients, the elderly patients had significantly lower skeletal muscle mass and a significantly lower percentage of patients in poor general condition with performance status 2 or higher, but there were no differences in parameters related to liver function or nutritional status. There were no significant differences in the incidence of severe AEs and therapeutic effects between the groups. No significant difference in progression-free survival was observed in the elderly and non-elderly patients; however, overall survival (OS) for sorafenib treatment was shorter in the elderly patients than in the non-elderly patients. Elderly patients consumed lower doses of both the drugs, and relative dose intensity (RDI) 4 weeks after treatment (4W-RDI) was associated with OS. Further, OS in the elderly patients was significantly longer in the subgroup with high 4W-RDI as compared to that in the subgroup with low 4W-RDI. CONCLUSIONS: MTAs can be safely administered to elderly patients with HCC. Furthermore, 4W-RDI is associated with longer OS.

64,Conversion surgery for initially unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma using lenvatinib combined with TACE plus PD-1 inhibitor: A real-world observational study.,10.1016/j.dld.2023.11.027,"BACKGROUND: Conversion therapy for initially unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (iuHCC) using lenvatinib combined with transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (TACE) plus a PD-1 inhibitor (LTP) has achieved promising results. However, further comparative research is necessary to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of conversion surgery (CS) for iuHCC. METHODS: Data for 32 consecutive patients with iuHCC receiving CS and 419 consecutive patients with resectable HCC receiving initial surgery (IS) between November 2019 and September 2022 were collected retrospectively. After propensity score matching (PSM), 65 patients were selected. RESULTS: Before matching, the CS group had longer EFS (not reached vs. 12.9 months, P < 0.001) and similar OS (not reached vs. not reached, P = 0.510) compared with the IS group. Similar results for EFS (P = 0.001) and OS (P = 0.190) were obtained after matching. The multivariable Cox model (HR = 0.231, 95% CI: 0.105-0.504; P < 0.001) and subgroup analyses confirmed that CS could improve EFS. The CS group had significantly lower incidence of microvascular invasion (MVI) than the IS group (3.1% vs. 50.4%, P < 0.001). Moreover, the two groups had similar safety profiles. CONCLUSIONS: CS is effective and safe for patients with iuHCC receiving LTP. LTP has the potential to reduce risk factors for postoperative recurrence, especially MVI, which may influence surgical decision-making. Elsevier Ltd.

66,"Neoadjuvant therapy of sequential TACE, camrelizumab, and apatinib for single huge hepatocellular carcinoma (NEO-START): study protocol for a randomized controlled trial.",10.1186/s13063-024-08340-1,"BACKGROUND: The high recurrence rate after liver resection emphasizes the urgent need for neoadjuvant therapy in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) to enhance the overall prognosis for patients. Immune checkpoint inhibitors, camrelizumab combined with an anti-angiogenic tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) apatinib, have emerged as a first-line treatment option for patients with unresectable HCC, yet its neoadjuvant application in combination with transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) in HCC remains unexplored. Therefore, this study aims to investigate the efficacy and safety of sequential TACE, camrelizumab, and apatinib as a neoadjuvant therapy for single, huge HCC. METHODS: This multi-center, open-label randomized phase 3 trial will be conducted at 7 tertiary hospitals. Patients with single huge (≥ 10 cm in diameter), resectable HCC will be randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to arm of surgery alone or arm of neoadjuvant therapy followed by surgery. In the neoadjuvant therapy group, patients will receive TACE within 1 week after randomization, followed by camrelizumab (200 mg q2w, 4 cycles), along with apatinib (250 mg qd, 2 months). Patients will receive liver resection after neoadjuvant therapy unless the disease is assessed as progressive. The primary outcome is recurrence-free survival (RFS) at 1 year. The planned sample size of 60 patients will be calculated to permit the accumulation of sufficient RFS events in 1 year to achieve 80% power for the RFS primary endpoint. DISCUSSION: Synergistic effects provided by multimodality therapy of locoregional treatment, TKI, and anti-programmed cell death 1 inhibitor significantly improved overall survival for patients with unresectable HCC.

METHODS: This single-center prospective randomized study was conducted in the Cancer Hospital, Guang Xi Medical University, Nanning. A total of 72 patients who received treatment in this hospital between August 2017 and July 2019 were included and randomly allocated to TACE group (n = 48) and RT group (n = 24). Next, overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) rates, recurrence patterns, financial burden, and safety were evaluated. RESULTS: The difference between the RT and TACE groups was not significant in one-, three-, and five-year OS (87.5%, 79.0%, and 62.5% vs. 93.8%, 75.9%, and 63.4%, respectively, P = 0.071) and PFS rates (79.0%, 54.2%, and 22.6% vs. 75.0%, 47.9%, and 32.6%, respectively, P = 0.071). Compared to the TACE group, the RT group had significantly lower intrahepatic recurrence rate (20.8% vs. 52.1%, P = 0.011), higher extrahepatic recurrence rate (37.5% vs. 14.6%, P = 0.034), and no marginal and diffuse recurrences (0% vs. 16.7%, P < 0.05). The mean overall treatment cost was higher (¥62,550.59 ± 4397.27 vs. ¥40,732.56 ± 9210.54, P < 0.01), the hospital stay (15.1 ± 3.7 vs. 11.8 ± 4.1 days, P < 0.01) was longer, and the overall treatment stay (13.3 ± 5.3 vs. 41.29 ± 12.4 days, P < 0.01) was shorter in the TACE group than in the RT group. Besides, both groups did not exhibit significant differences in the frequency and severity of adverse events. CONCLUSION: Both adjuvant TACE and RT can better the OS and PFS of patients with HCC.

METHODS: Total of 40 patients were enrolled in the study between September 2019 and November 2021. Data follow-up ends in April 2022. The study's main focus is on recurrence free survival (RFS), while the secondary objectives was safety. Chi-square tests, Kaplan-Meier, and Cox proportional hazards models were utilized to analyze the data. RESULTS: The median follow-up period was 21.40 months, and the median RFS was 15.40 months in the group that received combination therapy, which was statistically significantly different (HR: 0.44, p = 0.04) compared with the RFA group (8.2 months).

72,A Phase II Study of Optimized Individualized Adaptive Radiotherapy for Hepatocellular Carcinoma.,10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-23-1044,"PURPOSE: We hypothesized that optimizing the utility of stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) based on the individual patient's probability for tumor control and risk of liver injury would decrease toxicity without sacrificing local control in patients with impaired liver function or tumors not amenable to thermal ablation. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients with Child-Pugh (CP) A to B7 liver function with aggregate tumor size >3.5 cm, or CP ≥ B8 with any size tumor were prospectively enrolled on an Institutional Review Board-approved phase II clinical trial to undergo SBRT with baseline and midtreatment dose optimization using a quantitative, individualized utility-based analysis. Primary endpoints were change in CP score of ≥2 points within 6 months and local control. Protocol-treated patients were compared with patients receiving conventional SBRT at another cancer center using overlap weighting. RESULTS: A total of 56 patients with 80 treated tumors were analyzed with a median follow-up of 11.2 months. Two-year cumulative incidence of local progression was 6.4% [95% confidence interval (CI, 2.4-13.4)]. Twenty-one percent of patients experienced treatment-related toxicity within 6 months, which is similar to the rate for SBRT in patients with CP A liver function. An analysis using overlap weighting revealed similar local control [HR, 0.69; 95% CI (0.25-1.91); P = 0.48] and decreased toxicity [OR, 0.26; 95% CI (0.07-0.99); P = 0.048] compared with conventional SBRT.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Clinical data of HCC patients who underwent hepatectomy at four medical centers were retrospectively analyzed, including those who received PA-TACE and those who did not. These two categories of patients were randomly allocated to the development and validation cohorts in a 7:3 ratio. RESULTS: A total of 1505 HCC patients who underwent hepatectomy were included in this study, comprising 723 patients who did not receive PA-TACE and 782 patients who received PA-TACE. Among them, patients who received PA-TACE experienced more adverse events, although these events were mild and manageable (Grade 1-2, all p < 0.05). Nomograms were constructed and validated for patients with and without PA-TACE using independent predictors that influenced disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS). These two nomograms had C-indices greater than 0.800 in the development cohort and exhibited good calibration and discrimination ability compared to six conventional HCC staging systems. Patients in the intermediate-to-high-risk group in the nomogram who received PA-TACE had higher DFS and OS (all p < 0.05). In addition, tumor recurrence was significantly controlled in the intermediate-to-high-risk group of patients who received PA-TACE, while there was no significant difference in the low-risk group of patients who received PA-TACE.

74,Machine learning methods for accurately predicting survival and guiding treatment in stage I and II hepatocellular carcinoma.,10.1097/MD.0000000000035892,"Accurately predicting survival in patients with early hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is essential for making informed decisions about treatment and prognosis. Herein, we have developed a machine learning (ML) model that can predict patient survival and guide treatment decisions. We obtained patient demographic information, tumor characteristics, and treatment details from the SEER database. To analyze the data, we employed a Cox proportional hazards (CoxPH) model as well as 3 ML algorithms: neural network multitask logistic regression (N-MLTR), DeepSurv, and random survival forest (RSF). Our evaluation relied on the concordance index (C-index) and Integrated Brier Score (IBS). Additionally, we provided personalized treatment recommendations regarding surgery and chemotherapy choices and validated models' efficacy. A total of 1136 patients with early-stage (I, II) hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) who underwent liver resection or transplantation were randomly divided into training and validation cohorts at a ratio of 3:7. Feature selection was conducted using Cox regression analyses. The ML models (NMLTR: C-index = 0.6793; DeepSurv: C-index = 0.7028; RSF: C-index = 0.6890) showed better discrimination in predicting survival than the standard CoxPH model (C-index = 0.6696). Patients who received recommended treatments had higher survival rates than those who received unrecommended treatments. ML-based surgery treatment recommendations yielded higher hazard ratios (HRs): NMTLR HR = 0.36 (95% CI: 0.25-0.51, P < .001), DeepSurv HR = 0.34 (95% CI: 0.24-0.49, P < .001), and RSF HR = 0.37 (95% CI: 0.26-0.52, P = <.001). Chemotherapy treatment recommendations were associated with significantly improved survival for DeepSurv (HR: 0.57; 95% CI: 0.4-0.82, P = .002) and RSF (HR: 0.66; 95% CI: 0.46-0.94, P = .020).

This study evaluates the potential of CEUS-CT/MRI fusion imaging (FI) to improve tumor visibility and the associated RFA outcomes for small (≤ 3 cm) malignant liver tumors that were inconspicuous on US. METHODS: Between January 2019 and April 2021, a prospective study enrolled 248 patients with liver malignancies (≤ 3 cm) that were poorly visible on B-mode US. Tumor visibility and ablation feasibility were assessed using B-mode US, US-CT/MRI FI, and CEUS-CT/MRI FI, and graded on a 4-point scale. CEUS was employed post-registration of US and CT/MRI images, utilizing either SonoVue or Sonazoid. Comparisons between US-based and CEUS-based fusion visibility and feasibility scores were undertaken using the Friedman test. Moreover, rates of technical success, technique efficacy, local tumor progression (LTP), and major complications were assessed. RESULTS: The cohort included 223 hepatocellular carcinomas (HCCs) (89.9%) and 23 metastases (9.3%), with an average tumor size of 1.6 cm. CEUS-CT/MRI FI demonstrated a significant advantage in tumor visibility (3.4 ± 0.7 vs. 1.9 ± 0.6, P < 0.001) and technical feasibility (3.6 ± 0.6 vs. 2.9 ± 0.8, P < 0.001) compared to US-FI. In 85.5% of patients, CEUS addition to US-FI ameliorated tumor visibility. Technical success was achieved in 99.6% of cases. No severe complications were reported. One and two-year post CEUS-CT/MRI FI-guided RFA estimates for LTP were 9.3% and 10.9%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: CEUS-CT/MRI FI significantly improves the visualization of tumors not discernible on B-mode US, thus augmenting percutaneous RFA success and delivering improved therapeutic outcomes.

76,Adjuvant holmium-166 radioembolization after radiofrequency ablation in early-stage hepatocellular carcinoma patients: a dose-finding study (HORA EST HCC trial).,10.1007/s00259-024-06630-z,"PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to investigate the biodistribution of (super-)selective trans-arterial radioembolization (TARE) with holmium-166 microspheres ((166)Ho-MS), when administered as adjuvant therapy after RFA of HCC 2-5 cm. The objective was to establish a treatment volume absorbed dose that results in an absorbed dose of ≥ 120 Gy on the hyperemic zone around the ablation necrosis (i.e., target volume). METHODS: In this multicenter, prospective dose-escalation study in BCLC early stage HCC patients with lesions 2-5 cm, RFA was followed by (super-)selective infusion of (166)Ho-MS on day 5-10 after RFA. Dose distribution within the treatment volume was based on SPECT-CT. Cohorts of up to 10 patients were treated with an incremental dose (60 Gy, 90 Gy, 120 Gy) of (166)Ho-MS to the treatment volume. The primary endpoint was to obtain a target volume dose of ≥ 120 Gy in 9/10 patients within a cohort. RESULTS: Twelve patients were treated (male 10; median age, 66.5 years (IQR, [64.3-71.7])) with a median tumor diameter of 2.7 cm (IQR, [2.1-4.0]). At a treatment volume absorbed dose of 90 Gy, the primary endpoint was met with a median absorbed target volume dose of 138 Gy (IQR, [127-145]). No local recurrences were found within 1-year follow-up. CONCLUSION: Adjuvant (super-)selective infusion of (166)Ho-MS after RFA for the treatment of HCC can be administered safely at a dose of 90 Gy to the treatment volume while reaching a dose of ≥ 120 Gy to the target volume and may be a favorable adjuvant therapy for HCC lesions 2-5 cm.

However, evidence on the efficacy and safety of the novel treatment standard in patients with prior exposure to systemic treatment is scarce. The aim of this global, multicenter, observational study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of AB in patients after previous systemic therapy. METHODS: We screened our global, multicenter, prospectively maintained registry database for patients who received any systemic therapy before AB. The primary end point was overall survival; secondary end points were time-to-progression, progression-free survival, objective response rate, and safety (rate and severity of adverse events). RESULTS: Among 493 patients who received AB for unresectable HCC, 61 patients received prior systemic therapy and were included in this analysis. The median age of the study population was 66 years, with 91.8% males. Predominant risk factors for HCC were viral hepatitis (59%) and alcohol (23%). Overall survival for AB was 16.2 (95% CI, 14.5-17.9) months, time-to-progression and progression-free survival were 4.1 (95% CI, 1.5-6.6) and 3.1 (95% CI, 1.1-5.1) months, respectively. The objective response rate was 38.2% (7.3% with complete and 30.9% with partial response). Overall survival was not influenced by treatment line (2nd vs. >2nd) or previous systemic treatment modality (tyrosine kinase inhibitors vs. immune checkpoint inhibitors). Treatment-related adverse events of all grades according to Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events were documented in 42.6% of patients, with only 13.1% of grade ≥3, including one death.

78,A Pilot Study of Pembrolizumab in Combination With Y90 Radioembolization in Subjects With Poor Prognosis Hepatocellular Carcinoma.,10.1093/oncolo/oyad331,"BACKGROUND: Combination checkpoint inhibition therapy with yttrium-90 (Y90) radioembolization represents an emerging area of interest in the treatment of advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). HCRN GI15-225 is an open-label, single-arm multicenter, pilot study (NCT03099564). METHODS: Eligible patients had poor prognosis, localized HCC defined as having portal vein thrombus, multifocal disease, and/or diffuse disease that were not eligible for liver transplant or surgical resection. Patients received pembrolizumab 200 mg intravenously every 3 weeks in conjunction with glass yttrium-90 (Y90) radioembolization TheraSphere. Primary endpoint was 6-month progression-free survival (PFS6) per RECIST 1.1. Secondary endpoints included time to progression (TTP), objective response rate (ORR), overall survival (OS), and safety/tolerability. RESULTS: Between October 23, 2017 and November 24, 2020, 29 patients were enrolled: 2 were excluded per protocol. Fifteen of the remaining 27 patients were free of progression at 6 months (55.6%; 95% CI, 35.3-74.5) with median PFS 9.95 months (95% CI, 4.14-15.24) and OS 27.30 months (95% CI, 10.15-39.52).

80,Evaluation of the interest to combine a CD4 Th1-inducer cancer vaccine derived from telomerase and atezolizumab plus bevacizumab in unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma: a randomized non-comparative phase II study (TERTIO - PRODIGE 82).,10.1186/s12885-023-11065-0,"BACKGROUND: Several cancer immunotherapies that target the PD-L1/PD-1 pathway show promising clinical activity in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). However, the standard of care in first-line treatment with atezolizumab (anti-PD-L1 therapy) in combination with bevacizumab is associated with a limited objective response rate. Telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT) activation meets the criteria of oncogenic addiction in HCC and could be actionable therapeutic target and a relevant tumor antigen. Therefore we hypothesized that combining anti-PD-1/PD-L1 therapy with an anti-telomerase vaccine might be an attractive therapy in HCC. UCPVax is a therapeutic cancer vaccine composed of two separate peptides derived from telomerase (human TERT). UCPVax has been evaluated in a multicenter phase I/II study in non-small cell lung cancers and has demonstrated to be safe and immunogenic, and is under evaluation in combination with atezolizumab in a phase II clinical trial in tumors where telomerase reactivation contributes to an oncogene addiction (HPV(+) cancers). The aim of the TERTIO study is to determine the clinical interest and immunological efficacy of a treatment combining the CD4 helper T-inducer cancer anti-telomerase vaccine (UCPVax) with atezolizumab and bevacizumab in unresectable HCC in a multicenter randomized phase II study. METHODS: Patients with locally advanced, metastatic or unresectable HCC who have not previously received systemic anti-cancer treatment are eligible. The primary end point is the objective response rate at 6 months. Patients will be allocated to a treatment arm with a randomization 2:1. In both arms, patients will receive atezolizumab at fixed dose of 1200 mg IV infusion and bevacizumab at fixed dose of 15 mg/kg IV infusion, every 3 weeks, according to the standard of care. In the experimental arm, these treatments will be combined with the UCPVax vaccine at 0.5 mg subcutaneously. DISCUSSION: Combining anti-PD-1/PD-L1 therapy with an anti-telomerase vaccine gains serious consideration in HCC, in order to extend the clinical efficacy of anti-PD-1/PD-L1. Indeed, anti-cancer vaccines can induce tumor-specific T cell expansion and activation and therefore restore the cancer-immunity cycle in patients lacking pre-existing anti-tumor responses. Thus, there is a strong rational to combine immune checkpoint blockade therapy and anticancer vaccine (UCPVax) in order to activate antitumor T cell immunity and bypass the immunosuppression in the tumor microenvironment in HCC. This pivotal proof of concept study will evaluate the efficacy and safety of the combination of a CD4 Th1-inducer cancer vaccine derived from telomerase (UCPVax) and atezolizumab plus bevacizumab in unresectable HCC, as well as confirming their synergic mechanism, and settling the basis for a new combination for future clinical trials.

81,Objective Tumor Response of Hepatocellular Carcinoma Obtained by Transarterial Radioembolization with Iodine-131-Lipiodol Versus Transarterial Chemoembolization for Patients with and without Portal Venous Thrombosis: A Controlled Interventional Trial.,10.1016/j.acra.2023.10.029,"RATIONALE AND OBJECTIVES: Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) treatment often requires transarterial chemoembolization (TACE). However, TACE efficacy is controversial in the presence of portal vein thrombosis (PVT). Although transarterial radioembolization (TARE) benefit was previously documented in PVT, neither the objective tumor response (OTR) after TARE with Iodine-131-lipiodol ((131)I-lipiodol) nor the PVT effect on the results of locoregional therapies was accurately measured in prospective clinical trials. The aim of this study was to compare OTR and survival obtained by TARE with (131)I-lipiodol versus TACE in patients with cirrhosis and HCC, as well as between those with and without PVT. MATERIALS AND METHODS: 33 patients were included, from whom 38 tumors were assessed. OTR was quantified by a special algorithm to measure hypervascular HCC tissue. RESULTS: 19 tumors received each therapy. Nine subjects (27%) had PVT, most of them in the TARE group (p = 0.026). Mean OTR according to the tumor volumes was 24.2% ± 56% after TARE and 32.8% ± 48.9% after TACE, with no difference between the treatments (p = 0.616). Similar values were also observed between those with and without PVT (p = 0.704). Mean survival was 340 days and did not differ between the two treatments (p = 0.596), but was 194 days in PVT cases (p = 0.007). CONCLUSIONS: This is the first study in which OTR obtained by TARE with (131)I-lipiodol is accurately measured. Additionally, PVT impact on survival after TARE and TACE was precisely documented. Although the TARE group had more PVT subjects (who had shorter survival), TARE and TACE achieved similar OTR and OS rates. Elsevier Inc.

This phase 2 clinical trial was conducted to evaluate the safety and efficacy of combining palliative SBRT with camrelizumab (an anti-PD1 monoclonal antibody) in patients with unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (uHCC). METHODS: Patients with uHCC, Child-Pugh A/B liver function, and at least one measurable lesion were enrolled between April 2020 and August 2022. Patients were administered 200 mg camrelizumab intravenously from the first day of palliative SBRT and then every 3 weeks. Palliative SBRT was delivered daily over five fractions per week, with a dose range of 30-50 Gy. The primary endpoints were objective response rate (ORR) and safety.

This study aims to evaluate the diagnostic performance of the new ACR contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) Nonradiation TRA LI-RADS v2024 in HCC treated with transarterial chemoembolization (TACE). MATERIALS AND METHODS: This retrospective observational study included 87 patients treated with TACE from a previously reported cohort. At 15- and 30-days post-treatment, 68 and 72 HCC lesions were evaluated. Three blinded radiologists with different levels of CEUS experience interpreted the images independently. According to CEUS Nonradiation TRA LI-RADSv2024, both intralesional and perilesional tumor viability were evaluated and final TRA categories were as follows: TR-Nonviable, TR-Equivocal, and TR-Viable. The reference standard used was a composite of histology and imaging. RESULTS: 140 HCC lesions were analyzed. At 15 days post-treatment, the sensitivity (SN), specificity (SP), positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV), and accuracy of TR-Viable classification ranged from 72.5-94.3%, 72.2-86.4%, 86.8-91.4%, 65.6-86.7%, 76.9-86.8%, respectively. At 30 days post-treatment, the SN, PPV, and NPV of TR-Viable classification decreased, ranging from 65.9-84.2%, 85.7-90.6%, and 59.5-73.9%, respectively, while the SP increased, ranging from 80.0-88.0%.

METHODS: A total of 92 cases with massive HCC from October 2019 to January 2021 were prospectively enrolled and randomly divided into the study group (n = 46) and the control group (n = 46). The control group received TACE while the study group were treated with camrelizumab plus TACE. The primary end points were clinical efficacy and adverse events. And the secondary end points were liver function, and alpha fetoprotein (AFP), carcino-embryonic antigen (CEA), carbohydrate antigen 19-9 (CA19-9) levels before and after treatment. RESULTS: All participants were followed-up for 7 to 24 months, with a median of 12 months. Patients in the study group received TACE for 1-3 times, with an average of (2.01 ± 0.09) times, while patients in the control group receive TACE for 2-4 times, with an average of (3.78 ± 0.12) times, and the control group received significantly more TACEs (χ(2) = 5.518, P = 0.019).

85,Adjuvant stereotactic body radiotherapy after marginal resection for hepatocellular carcinoma with microvascular invasion: A randomised controlled trial.,10.1016/j.ejca.2022.02.012,"BACKGROUND: Marginal resection frequently occurred in hepatectomy for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), leading to increased local recurrence, especially among patients with microvascular invasion (MVI). Stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) showed effectiveness in controlling tumour and tumour thrombosis. This study aimed to investigate the efficacy of SBRT, targeting on suboptimal resection margin, as adjuvant setting in MVI-positive HCC. METHODS: This was a single-centre randomised controlled trial conducted in Eastern Hepatobiliary Surgery Hospital, Shanghai, China. Participants with MVI-positive HCC receiving marginal resection were randomly assigned to the postoperative adjuvant SBRT or surgery alone (SA) group. SBRT was delivered by the CyberKnife® system with marker tracking devices, targeting on resection margin one month after surgery. The disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS) were compared between the groups, and the adverse events (AEs) were monitored. This trial was registered on ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04891874. FINDINGS: A total of 76 participants were enrolled, with 38 in each group. The one-, three-, and five-year DFS rates were 92.1%, 65.8%, and 56.1% in SBRT group versus 76.3%, 36.8%, and 26.3% in SA group, respectively (p = 0.005). The one-, three-, and five-year OS rates were 100%, 89.5%, and 75.0% in SBRT group versus 100.0%, 68.4%, and 53.7% in SA group, respectively (p = 0.053). The total dose of SBRT for single participant was 35 Gy, and the biological effective dose (BED) was 59.5 Gy. The overall incidence of radiotherapy-related AE was 31.6% (12/38), and no grade 3 or higher grade AE was developed.

Currently, no approved adjuvant therapy has been shown to reduce HCC recurrence rates. In this study, the in vivo effect of sequential combination treatment with recombinant mouse interferon-alpha (rmIFN-α) and an anti-mouse-PD1 antibody on hepatitis B virus (HBV) clearance in mice was evaluated. A Phase I clinical trial was then conducted to assess the safety, tolerability, and inhibitory activity of sequential therapy with ropeginterferon alfa-2b and nivolumab in patients with HCC recurrence who underwent curative surgery for HBV-related HCC. The animal modeling study showed that HBV suppression was significantly greater with the rmIFN-α and anti-PD1 sequential combination treatment in comparison with sole treatment with rmIFN-α or anti-PD1. In the Phase I study, eleven patients completed the sequential therapy with ropeginterferon alfa-2b every two weeks for six doses at 450 µg, followed by three doses of nivolumab every two weeks up to 0.75 mg/kg. A notable decrease in or clearance of HBV surface antigen was observed in two patients. The dose-limiting toxicity of grade 3 alanine transaminase and aspartate aminotransferase increases was observed in one patient. The maximum tolerated dose was then determined. To date, no HCC recurrence has been observed. The treatment modality was well tolerated.

87,Nonadherence to oral cancer chemotherapy in hepatocellular carcinoma: prevalence and predictive factors in Vietnam.,10.1186/s12885-024-12601-2,"PURPOSE: Standard oral cancer chemotherapy (OCT) or targeted therapy (OTT) has expanded the treatment methods for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). However, its principal nonadherence causes a reduction in efficacy. We aimed to evaluate the status of nonadherence and influencing factors among outpatient patients with HCC. PATIENTS AND METHODS: In 2021, a prospective observational study was conducted on 384 patients with either old or newly diagnosed HCC treated with OTT. Nonadherence to OCT was determined using the eight-item Morisky Medication Adherence Scale, with a score < 6 points. The patients were finished with a six-month follow-up investigation by questionnaires. RESULTS: 54,8% of HCC outpatients were nonadherent to OCT, with a mean Morisky score of 5.19. They dropped out of the treatment mainly because of drug side effects, such as fatigue (72.4%), hand-foot syndrome (42.7%), diarrhea (38.3%), nausea (25%), insomnia (24.7%), abdominal pain (12%), and anxiety about these adverse events (65.9%). Additionally, financial difficulties and low relative copayments were significantly correlated with the noncompliant treatment of patients (OR = 2.29, 95% CI = 1.32-3.98, P = 0.003; OR = 4.36, 95% CI = 0.95-19.93, P = 0.039, respectively). Moreover, inadequate individual information about the clinical course, the art of treatment, and medication usage instructions were suggestive barriers to adherence to treatment (OR = 1.96, 95% CI = 1.08-3.55, P = 0.024; OR = 1.86, 95% CI = 1.1-3.14, P = 0.02; OR = 2.34, 95% CI = 1.29-4.26, P = 0.004, respectively). Finally, a low level of trust in doctors was an essential factor in nonadherence (Mean of the Anderson Trust in Physician Scale scores counted 38.12 vs. 43.97, respectively for non-adherence vs. adherence, P = 0.00001). CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests a high rate of primary nonadherence to standard oral targeted therapy among HCC outpatient patients because of drug side effects, patient awareness of treatment, and lack of confidence in healthcare providers. Close supervision, proper medication instructions, appropriate dosage reductions, and comprehensive patient counseling might be necessary to control nonadherence.",Ky TD; Loan NT; Thinh NT; Binh MT,False,Does not match PICOS criteria as the intervention and comparison are not specified.,outpatient patients with HCC,not specified,not specified,status of nonadherence and influencing factors,prospective observational study,False,"Model A's PICOS extraction and decision are correct.

88,Efficacy and safety of SBRT combined with sintilimab and IBI305 in patients with advanced HCC and previously failed immunotherapy: study protocol of a phase 2 clinical trial.,10.1136/bmjopen-2023-077903,"INTRODUCTION: Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a leading cause of cancer-related death in China. The combination of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) and antiangiogenic drugs, such as bevacizumab and tyrosine kinase inhibitors, has been recommended as first-line treatment for advanced HCC. However, two-thirds of patients did not benefit from this form of immunotherapy. Currently, data on the subsequent regimen for patients previously treated with ICIs are lacking. Studies have shown that the combination of radiotherapy (RT) and ICIs is a potentially effective second-line therapy for HCC. This study aims to assess the efficacy and safety of combined therapy with stereotactic body RT (SBRT), sintilimab and IBI305 (a biosimilar of bevacizumab) in patients with HCC following the progression of first-line ICI therapy. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: This study is an open-label, single-arm, single-centre, phase 2 trial of 21 patients with advanced HCC in whom previous ICI therapy has failed. Participants will receive approximately 30-40 Gy/5-8F SBRT, followed by 200 mg sintilimab and 15 mg/kg IBI305 intravenously every 3 weeks. Treatment will continue until the development of unacceptable toxicity or disease progression. We will use Simon's two-stage design, with the objective response rate (ORR) as the primary endpoint. Secondary endpoints include ORR of lesions without RT, disease control rate, progression-free survival, overall survival and safety.

We investigated whether patients with GALNT14-rs9679162 ""non-TT"" unfavorable genotype benefited from chemoembolization plus sorafenib combination therapy. METHODS: Intermediate stage HCC patients were recruited for GALNT14-rs9679162 genotyping before TACE. Patients with ""TT"" genotype received only TACE, labeled as TT (TACE) group. Patients with ""non-TT"" genotype (""GG"" or ""GT"") were randomized to receive either TACE alone, labeled as Non-TT (TACE) group, or TACE plus sorafenib, labeled as Non-TT (TACE + Sora) group. The latter group received sorafenib 400 mg daily plus TACE. RESULTS: From October 2015 to April 2019, 103 HCC patients scheduled to receive chemoembolization were screened. Of them, 84 met inclusion criteria and were assigned to TT (TACE) (n = 25), Non-TT (TACE) (n = 30) and Non-TT (TACE + Sora) (n = 29) groups according to their GALNT14 genotypes. Repeated TACE sessions were performed on-demand and patients were followed until November 2020. It was found that TT (TACE) and Non-TT (TACE + Sora) patients had shorter time-to-complete response compared with that in Non-TT (TACE) patients (p < 0.001 and 0.009, respectively). These two groups also had longer time-to-TACE progression (p < 0.001 and 0.006, respectively) and longer progression-free survival (p = 0.001 and 0.021, respectively). However, TT (TACE) patients harbored longer overall survival compared with those in non-TT (TACE + Sora) and non-TT (TACE) patients (p = 0.028, < 0.001, respectively). CONCLUSION: Combination of sorafenib and TACE for ""non-TT"" patients partially overcame the genetic disadvantage on treatment outcomes in terms of time-to-complete response, time-to-TACE progression and progression-free survival.

However, survival remains poor with only a subset of patients deriving benefit. This trial investigated the safety and efficacy of stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) with immunotherapy in HCC. METHODS AND MATERIALS: In this multicenter phase 1 randomized trial, patients with advanced or unresectable HCC received liver SBRT (40 Gy in 5 fractions) followed by either nivolumab alone or nivolumab plus ipilimumab. The primary endpoint was dose-limiting toxicity occurring within 6 months of SBRT. Secondary endpoints included overall response rate, progression-free survival, overall survival (OS), distant disease control, and local control of the irradiated tumor. Disease status and response endpoints were assessed radiographically every 8 weeks until progression or initiation of nonprotocol therapy. Response was determined using both RECIST (Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors) 1.1 and iRECIST. RESULTS: Fourteen patients were enrolled across 3 centers. Thirteen patients were evaluated for study endpoints. The study was closed early because of slow accrual. The median follow-up time was 42.7 months. Dose-limiting toxicities within 6 months occurred in 2 (15.4%) of 13 patients: 1 of 6 patients in the nivolumab arm (16.7%; 90% confidence interval [CI], 0.9%-58.2%) and 1 of 7 patients in the nivolumab plus ipilimumab arm (14.3%; 90% CI, 0.7%-52.1%). Grade 3 adverse events occurred in 8 (61.6%), 5 (71.4%), and 3 (50.0%) patients in the overall nivolumab plus ipilimumab and nivolumab cohorts. Grade 3 hepatotoxicity occurred in 4 (30.8%), 3 (42.9%), and 1 (16.7%) patients in the respective cohorts. Clinical outcomes favored the nivolumab plus ipilimumab arm compared with nivolumab alone, including an overall response rate of 57% (4 of 7 patients; 90% CI, 23%-87%) versus 0% (0 of 6 patients; 90% CI, 0%-39%), median progression-free survival of 11.6 months (90% CI, 4.5 months to not reached) versus 2.7 months (90% CI, 1.3-4.7 months), and median OS of 41.6 months (90% CI, 4.5 months to not reached) versus 4.7 months (90% CI, 2.0-16.2 months) (all P < .05). With combination immunotherapy, 3-year OS was 57% (90% CI, 23%-81%), with 2 patients alive after 42.7 months without progression and negative PET.

91,Partial hepatectomy versus interventional treatment in patients with hepatitis B virus-related hepatocellular carcinoma and clinically significant portal hypertension: a randomized comparative clinical trial.,10.1002/cac2.12614,"BACKGROUND: The widely accepted view that portal hypertension (PHT) is a contraindication to hepatectomy for patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is being increasingly challenged. The long-term survival outcomes and safety of partial hepatectomy versus interventional treatment using ablation with or without pre-ablation transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) in patients with HBV-related HCC within the Milan criteria and with clinically significant PHT were compared in this study. METHODS: This open-label randomized clinical trial was conducted on consecutive patients with clinically PHT and hepatitis B virus (HBV)-related HCC with tumors which were within the Milan criteria. These patients were randomized 1:1 to receive either partial hepatectomy or interventional treatment between December 2012 and June 2018. The primary endpoint was overall survival (OS); secondary endpoints included recurrence-free survival (RFS) and therapeutic safety. RESULTS: Each of the 2 groups had 80 patients. The 1-, 3- and 5-year OS rates in the partial hepatectomy group and the interventional treatment group were 95.0%, 86.2%, 69.5% versus 93.8%, 77.5%, 64.9%, respectively (P = 0.325). The corresponding RFS rates were 78.8%, 55.0%, 46.2% versus 71.3%, 52.5%, 45.0%, respectively (P = 0.783). The partial hepatectomy group had a higher complication rate compared to the interventional group (67.5% vs. 20%, P < 0.001). However, the differences were mainly in Clavien-Dindo Grade I complications (P < 0.001), while not significant in Grade II/III/IV/V (All P > 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: This study shows that partial hepatectomy treatment did not meet prespecified significance for improved OS and RFS compared to interventional treatment for patients with HBV-related HCC within the Milan criteria and with clinically significant PHT.

However, whether DEB-TACE is superior to conventional TACE (cTACE) remains unclear. OBJECTIVE: This randomized controlled trial aimed to compare the efficacy and safety of DEB-TACE versus cTACE in treating HCC with PVTT. METHODS: The study was conducted at a tertiary care center in Southeast China. HCC patients with PVTT were randomized at a 1:1 ratio into the DEB-TACE or cTACE groups. The primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS), and the secondary endpoints were overall survival (OS) and the incidence of adverse events (AEs). An independent review committee assessed the radiologic response according to the modified Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (mRECIST). AEs were assessed by the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 4.0. Systemic therapies were not restricted. RESULTS: Between September 2018 and July 2020, 163 patients were randomized to undergo DEB-TACE ( n =82) or cTACE ( n =81). Nine patients were excluded, and 154 patients were included in the final analysis; the median age was 55 years (range, 24-78 years), and 140 (90.9%) were male. The median PFS in the DEB-TACE group was 6.0 months (95% CI, 5.0-10.0) versus 4.0 months (95% CI, 3.0-5.0) in the cTACE group (hazard ratio, 0.63; 95% CI, 0.42-0.95; P =0.027). The DEB-TACE group showed a higher response rate [51 (66.2%) vs. 36 (46.8%); P =0.0015] and a longer median OS [12.0 months (95% CI, 9.0-16.0) vs. 8.0 months (95% CI, 7.0-11.0), P =0.039] than the cTACE group. Multivariate analysis showed that the treatment group, ALBI score, distant metastasis and additional TKIs were the four independent prognostic factors correlated with PFS. In addition, the treatment group, PVTT group and combination with surgery were independently associated with OS. AEs were similar in the two groups, and postembolization syndrome was the most frequent AE. CONCLUSION: DEB-TACE is superior to cTACE in treating HCC patients with PVTT, demonstrating improved PFS and OS with an acceptable safety profile, and may thus emerge as a promising treatment strategy for HCC patients with PVTT.

95,Improving Adjuvant Liver-Directed Treatment Recommendations for Unresectable Hepatocellular Carcinoma: An Artificial Intelligence-Based Decision-Making Tool.,10.1200/CCI.22.00024,"PURPOSE: Liver-directed therapy after transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) can lead to improvement in survival for selected patients with unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). However, there is uncertainty in the appropriate application and modality of therapy in current clinical practice guidelines. The aim of this study was to develop a proof-of-concept, machine learning (ML) model for treatment recommendation in patients previously treated with TACE and select patients who might benefit from additional treatment with combination stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) or radiofrequency ablation (RFA). METHODS: This retrospective observational study was based on data from an urban, academic hospital system selecting for patients diagnosed with stage I-III HCC from January 1, 2008, to December 31, 2018, treated with TACE, followed by adjuvant RFA, SBRT, or no additional liver-directed modality. A feedforward, ML ensemble model provided a treatment recommendation on the basis of pairwise assessments evaluating each potential treatment option and estimated benefit in survival. RESULTS: Two hundred thirty-seven patients met inclusion criteria, of whom 54 (23%) and 49 (21%) received combination of TACE and SBRT or TACE and RFA, respectively. The ML model suggested a different consolidative modality in 32.7% of cases among patients who had previously received combination treatment. Patients treated in concordance with model recommendations had significant improvement in progression-free survival (hazard ratio 0.5; P = .007). The most important features for model prediction were cause of cirrhosis, stage of disease, and albumin-bilirubin grade (a measure of liver function). CONCLUSION: In this proof-of-concept study, an ensemble ML model was able to provide treatment recommendations for HCC who had undergone prior TACE. Additional treatment in line with model recommendations was associated with significant improvement in progression-free survival, suggesting a potential benefit for ML-guided medical decision making.",Mo A; Velten C; Jiang JM; Tang J; Ohri N; Kalnicki S; Mirhaji P; Nemoto K; Aasman B; Garg M; Guha C; Brodin NP; Kabarriti R,False,Study design is not a randomized controlled trial and intervention does not involve ICIs.,patients diagnosed with stage I-III HCC treated with TACE,combination stereotactic body radiotherapy or radiofrequency ablation,no additional liver-directed modality,progression-free survival,retrospective observational study,False,Model A's decision is correct.

This phase Ib study aims to explore the safety and clinical efficacy of intraperitoneal anti-programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) antibody in these patients. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients received sintilimab 100 mg intraperitoneally plus best supportive care on days 1, 8, and 15 in three cycles of 4 weeks. The course was repeated every 28 days until intolerable toxicity had developed or disease progression. The primary endpoint was safety, while the secondary endpoints were objective response rate (ORR), ascites control rate (ACR), and overall survival (OS). RESULTS: From February 2021 through November 2022, a total of 21 patients (14 hepatocellular carcinoma and 7 cholangiocarcinoma) were enrolled to receive intraperitoneal sintilimab. Twelve patients had adverse events (AEs). The most common grade 3 AEs were fatigue, rash, and abdominal pain. No grade ≥4 AEs occurred in any patients. ORR was only evaluated in 13 patients, including partial response in 4, stable disease in 7, and progressive disease in 2. A reduction in the median maximum diameter of the tumor after treatment was observed; however, there was no statistical significance among patients. The objective remission rate of ascites was 43.75%, and the median OS for all 21 patients was 17.6 weeks.

The role of neoadjuvant radiotherapy (RT) in treating patients with an early-stage HCC predicted to have high risks of MVI remains to be explored. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Consecutive patients with a resectable single and small (≤5 cm) hepatitis B virus-related HCC predicted to have high risks of MVI were randomized 1:1 to receive either neoadjuvant intensity modulated radiation therapy (18 Gy with fractionated doses of 3 Gy) followed by surgery 4 weeks later or upfront surgery. The primary endpoint was disease-free survival (DFS). The secondary outcomes included overall survival (OS), objective response rate, RT-related toxicity and surgical complications. RESULTS: There were 30 patients randomized to each of the two groups. In the neoadjuvant RT group, three patients violated the study protocol, with two having upfront hepatectomy and one radiofrequency ablation after RT. The objective response rate after RT was 25.0% (7/28), but 2 patients suffered from grade 3 liver toxicity. The median follow-up was 68 months (interquartile range, 58-70 months) in the neoadjuvant RT group, and 68 months (interquartile range, 62-75 months) in the upfront surgery group. On intention-to-treat analysis, the median DFS and median OS were not reached in both the 2 arms. The 1-year, 2-year, 3-year and 5-year DFS rates for the neoadjuvant RT group were 86.7%, 76.7%, 60.0% and 56.3%, versus 90.0%, 66.7%, 52.8% and 45.7% in the upfront surgery group ( P =0.448), respectively.

98,Combination Transarterial Chemoembolization and Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy for Unresectable Single Large Hepatocellular Carcinoma: Results From a Prospective Phase 2 Trial.,10.1016/j.ijrobp.2022.05.021,"PURPOSE: Patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) at Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC) early-stage A (BCLC A) not suitable for surgery are first considered for ablation. Nonetheless, objective responses and long-term results for ablation in tumors larger than 3 to 4 cm are suboptimal, creating an unmet clinical need. This phase 2 trial studied combination of transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) and stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) for BCLC A patients with a solitary HCC from 4 to 7 cm. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Eligible patients were BCLC A, Child-Pugh score ≤7, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status 0 presenting with a single HCC from 4 to 7 cm not suitable for resection or liver transplantation. Treatment consisted of 2 sessions of drug-eluting bead-TACE within 1 month followed by immediate SBRT. SBRT delivered 35 to 50 Gy in 5 fractions. The primary endpoint was best objective response rate (ORR) by modified Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumours (mRECIST). Secondary endpoints were overall survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS), and toxic effects. RESULTS: From 2014 to 2020, 32 were enrolled in a single institution with median follow-up of 37 months. Thirty patients had at least 1 posttreatment scan to assess response. ORR in the target lesion was 91%: 63% complete response (CR; n = 20), 28% partial response (n = 9), and 3% progression of disease (n = 1). Median time to CR was 10.1 months. Median OS was not yet reached and median PFS was 35 months. Patients achieving CR had a trend toward improved PFS (P = .09). Toxic effects were low. CONCLUSIONS: This phase 2 trial showed very promising ORR when combining TACE + SBRT in large, unresectable HCC, which translates into excellent OS and PFS.

Theoretically, a combination of tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) with ICIs may restore immunotherapy sensitivity. METHODS: In this phase 1b study, patients received AL2846, an antiangiogenic TKI with multiple targets (c-MET, VEGFR1, c-KIT, Axl, RET, KDR, and VEGFR3), in combination with an anti-PD-L1 antibody (TQB2450) until disease progression, intolerable toxicity, death, or discontinuation for any cause. The primary end points included overall response rate (ORR) and safety, with secondary end points encompassing progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), disease control rate (DCR), and duration of response. RESULTS: Between November 2021 and September 2022, 18 patients with ESCC and 15 patients with HCC, whose ORR was 11.1% (95% confidence interval [CI], 3.1%-32.8%) and 0%, respectively, were enrolled. Adverse events (AEs) of any grade and treatment-related AEs were documented in 32 patients (97.0%) and 31 patients (93.9%), respectively. Grade 3 or higher AEs were observed in 10 patients (30.3%), with vomiting (6.1%) and infectious pneumonia (9.1%) being the most prevalent.

100,Monitoring Response to Transarterial Chemoembolization in Hepatocellular Carcinoma Using (18)F-Fluorothymidine PET.,10.2967/jnumed.119.240598,"Accurate disease monitoring is essential after transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) because of the potential for profound adverse events and large variations in survival outcome. Posttreatment changes on conventional imaging can confound determination of residual or recurrent disease, magnifying the clinical challenge. On the basis of increased expression of thymidylate synthase (TYMS), thymidine kinase 1 (TK-1), and equilibrative nucleoside transporter 1 (SLC29A1) in HCC compared with liver tissue, we conducted a proof-of-concept study evaluating the efficacy of 3'-deoxy-3'-(18)F-fluorothymidine ((18)F-FLT) PET to assess response to TACE. Because previous PET studies in HCC have been hampered by high background liver signal, we investigated whether a temporal-intensity voxel clustering (kinetic spatial filtering, or KSF) improved lesion detection. Methods: A tissue microarray was built from 36 HCC samples and from matching surrounding cirrhotic tissue and was stained for TK-1 A prospective study was conducted; 18 patients with a diagnosis of HCC by the criteria of the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases who were eligible for treatment with TACE were enrolled. The patients underwent baseline conventional imaging and dynamic (18)F-FLT PET with KSF followed by TACE. Imaging was repeated 6-8 wk after TACE. The PET parameters were compared with modified enhancement-based RECIST. Results: Cancer Genome Atlas analysis revealed increased RNA expression of TYMS, TK-1, and SLC29A1 in HCC. TK-1 protein expression was significantly higher in HCC (P < 0.05). The sensitivity of (18)F-FLT PET for baseline HCC detection was 73% (SUV(max), 9.7 ± 3.0; tumor to liver ratio, 1.2 ± 0.3). Application of KSF did not improve lesion detection. Lesion response after TACE by modified RECIST was 58% (14 patients with 24 lesions). A 30% reduction in mean (18)F-FLT PET uptake was observed after TACE, correlating with an observed PET response of 60% (15/25). A significant and profound reduction in the radiotracer delivery parameter K(1) after TACE was observed.

METHODS: This is an observational retrospective study done between May 2020 and April 2022. The data of 17 patients who underwent SBRT were collected. Patients of Child-Pugh score (CPS) A5-B7 and along with a liver reserve of ≥700 cc were included. Local control (LC), overall survival (OS) and adverse events including hepatic decompensation were carefully recorded. RESULTS: In the cohort, the tumour thrombus was extended to the right atrium in nine (52.9%) patients, and regional nodal and lung were found in 60% and 31.4% of patients respectively. The median gross tumour volume (GTV) was 745 cc (107-1,650 cc). The median SBRT dose prescription was 35 Gy (25-45 Gy) in 5-10 fractions. At 6 months, LC and OS were 80% and 75% respectively. On multivariate analysis, an ALBI score >-2.36 was found to be the predictor for the poor OS. Post-SBRT, a change in CPs by 2 points was observed in one patient (5.9%) which was managed conservatively. Post-radiation, improvement in pain and discomfort was observed in 92.3% and 87% of patients, respectively and bone metastasis related pain was also resolved. CONCLUSION: Stereotactic body radiotherapy is a safe and feasible option for HCC patients with IVC and right atrium tumour thrombosis.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: This single-center, prospective, phase II, randomized controlled, non-inferiority, double-blind trial will enroll 128 treatment-naïve patients with HCC (≤ 5 tumors, 1-5 cm in diameter) for conventional TACE. Participants will be randomly assigned (1:1) to either IDA-TACE or DOX-TACE, with stratification by Child-Pugh class. Superselective conventional TACE will be performed using cone-beam CT and small-bore microcatheters. Patient evaluations, including dynamic imaging and blood tests, will occur at 1, 3, and 6 months post-initial treatment. The primary outcome measure is the objective response rate (ORR) according to mRECIST at 6 months. Secondary outcomes include 3-month and 6-month tumor responses, time-to-progression, the incidence of treatment-related serious adverse events within 30 days, and the incidence and severity of any adverse events. STATISTICS: Non-inferiority will be claimed if the upper limit of a one-sided 97.5% confidence interval for the proportion difference (i.e., ""6-month ORR of DOX-TACE"" - ""6-month ORR of IDA-TACE"") falls below 0.15 in both intention-to-treat and per-protocol analyses. The proportion difference and its confidence interval will be calculated by the Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel method to obtain a weighted average of stratum-specific proportion differences. EXPECTED GAIN OF KNOWLEDGE: If IDA-TACE demonstrates outcomes comparable to DOX-TACE, this study could provide compelling evidence that various cytotoxic agents yield similar contributions in TACE, considering the minor role of chemotherapeutic agents in TACE.

RESULTS: Final analysis included 265 patients (154 men, 111 women; mean age = 54.5 ± 11.8 years; range = 38-76 years). Complete response was achieved by 86.5% of patients who received combined therapy compared with 54.8% with only TACE and 56.5% with only MWA (p = 0.0002). The recurrence rate after 12 months was significantly lower in Group 3 (22.47%) than Groups 1 (60.7%) and 2 (51.1%) (p = 0.0001). The overall survival rate (three years after therapy) was significantly higher in Group 3 (69.6%) than Groups 1 (54.7%) and 2 (54.3%) (p = 0.02). The mean progression-free survival was significantly higher in Group 3 than groups 1 and 2 (p < 0.001). A decrease in AFP concentration was seen in 75%, 63%, and 48% patients of Group 3, 2, and 1, respectively.

106,Hepatocellular Carcinoma in Ceará: Epidemiology and Treatment in a Reference Liver Transplant Center in Northeast Brazil.,10.1016/j.transproceed.2024.01.024,"Hepatocellular carcinoma remains a significant worldwide malignancy and an important cause of cancer-related death. The incidence is increasing globally. In Latin America, there is no consistent data on the epidemiology of hepatocellular carcinoma. However, Brazil is considered a country with an intermediate incidence of this liver neoplasm. In the state of Ceará, situated in the northeast region of Brazil, there are no consistent clinical and epidemiologic data on the actual incidence and the treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma. The purpose of this article is to describe epidemiologic characteristics and treatment forms of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma who were treated in a Liver Transplant Center. A retrospective observational study was conducted using the database from the register of 299 patients with hepatocellular carcinoma between June 2004 and February 2022. Only patients born in Ceará were included. Therefore, most patients were eligible, based on the Milan Criteria, to undergo liver transplantation with a Model End Stage Liver Disease score of 12.48 ± 4.66 points, and the waiting list time was approximately 7 months with 8.7% hepatocellular carcinoma recurrence after liver transplant. A total of 38.5 % of cases were outside the Milan criteria at the time of cancer diagnosis, and transarterial chemoembolization was the main treatment choice. In conclusion, the diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma in Ceará mainly occurs in male patients with hepatitis C or alcoholism, with a mean age of 61.55 years and a previous diagnosis of liver disease.

110,Construction and validation of a nomogram for hepatocellular carcinoma patients based on HCC-GRIm score.,10.1007/s00432-023-05037-x,"PURPOSE: To construct a nomogram for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients base on HCC-GRIm score. METHODS: Clinical cases of HCC patients diagnosed at Hunan Integrated Traditional Chinese and Western Medicine Hospital were included, and these were randomly divided into the training cohort (n = 219) and the validation cohort (n = 94), and those patients were divided into low GRIm-Score group (scores 0, 1, and 2) and high GRIm-Score group (scores 3, 4, and 5). In the training cohort, independent risk factors were determined by Cox regression analysis, and a nomogram was constructed by independent risk factors. The efficiency and the clinical applicability of nomograms were evaluated using ROC curves, calibration plot, and the decision curve (DCA), and the patients were divided into high-risk, middle-risk, and low-risk groups according to total score of nomogram. RESULTS: Compared to low HCC-GRIm score group, high HCC-GRIm score group with BCLC stage is more advanced (P < 0.001), and fewer patients received TACE (P = 0.005) and surgical treatment (P = 0.001). There was higher rate of the presence of vascular invasion (P < 0.001) and distant metastasis (P < 0.001). Multivariate Cox regression analysis screened 4 independent risk factors to construct a nomogram of HCC patients, including HCC-GRIm score, BCLC stage, albumin-to-globulin ratio (AGR), and glutamyl trans-peptidase (GGT). The consistency index (C-index) of the nomogram of the training was 0.843 (0.832-0.854) and the validation was 0.870 (0.856-0.885). The time-dependent parameter showed the AUC values of the training cohort at 1, 3, and 5 years were 0.954 (95% CI 0.929-0.980), 0.952 (95% CI 0.919-0.985), and 925 (95% CI 0.871-0.979), while the AUC values of validation cohort at 1, 3, and 5 years were 0.974 (95% CI 0.950-0.998), 0.965 (95% CI 0.931-0.999), and 0.959 (95% CI 0.898-1.021). The calibration plot showed the nomogram fits well onto perfect curves, and the DCA curve showed the net benefit of the nomogram at a certain probability threshold is significantly higher than the net benefit of the BCLC stage at the same threshold probability. Finally, all patients were divided into high-risk, middle-risk, and low-risk groups based on the total score of nomogram, and it showed effectively to identify high-risk patients.

111,Multiparametric magnetic resonance-guided and monitored microwave ablation in liver cancer.,10.4103/jcrt.JCRT_1024_20,"PURPOSE: The objective of our study was to prospectively evaluate the feasibility, effectiveness, and safety of 1.0T open multiparametric magnetic resonance (MR)-guided and monitored microwave ablation (MWA) of liver cancer. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Fifty-six liver lesions (12 - initial hepatocellular carcinoma, 34 - recurrent hepatocellular carcinoma, and 10 - metastatic liver cancers) in 45 patients were treated with MWA ablation using MR guidance and monitoring. The mean diameter of the liver lesions was 1.7 ± 0.9 cm (range, 0.5-4.6 cm). The 56 liver lesions were divided into 3 groups according to diameter: the <1.0 cm group (17 lesions), the 1.0-2.0 cm group (19 lesions), and the >2.0 cm group (20 lesions). Technical success, technical effectiveness, local tumor progression, procedure duration, and complications were assessed. Primary technical effectiveness was assessed 3 months after the MWA, while local tumor progression was assessed more than 3 months after the MWA. The follow-up time for assessment of treatment response ranged from 12 to 30 months (median, 23 months). RESULTS: The technical success rate was 100%. Primary technical effectiveness was achieved in 52/56 (92.8%) lesions. Local tumor progression was detected in three tumors after initial technical effectiveness. The median duration of the intervention per tumor was 66 min (range, 40-156 min). There were no significant differences between lesion groups in the technical success rate, primary technical effectiveness rate, or local tumor progression rate. There were no major complications following the ablation therapy.

112,Efficacy of dexamethasone and N-acetylcysteine combination in preventing post-embolization syndrome after transarterial chemoembolization in hepatocellular carcinoma.,10.3748/wjg.v29.i5.890,"BACKGROUND: Conventional transarterial chemoembolization (cTACE) is the current standard treatment for intermediate-stage hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Post-embolization syndrome (PES) is complex clinical syndrome that presents as fever, abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting. Either dexamethasone (DEXA) or N-acetylcysteine (NAC) is used to prevent PES; however, the synergistic effect of their combined therapy for preventing PES and liver decompensation has not been determined. AIM: To evaluate the efficacy of DEXA and NAC combination in preventing PES and liver decompensation after cTACE. METHODS: Patients with Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer stage A or B HCC who were scheduled for TACE were prospectively enrolled. All patients were randomly stratified to receive NAC and DEXA or placebo. The dual therapy (NAC + DEXA) group received intravenous administration of 10 mg DEXA every 12 h, NAC 24 h prior to cTACE (150 mg/kg/h for 1 h followed by 12.5 mg/kg/h for 4 h), and a continuous infusion of 6.25 mg/h NAC plus 4 mg DEXA every 12 h for 48 h after cTACE. The placebo group received an infusion of 5% glucose solution until 48 h after procedure. PES was defined by South West Oncology Group toxicity code grading of more than 2 that was calculated using incidence of fever, nausea, vomiting, and pain. RESULTS: One-hundred patients were enrolled with 50 patients in each group. Incidence of PES was significantly lower in the NAC + DEXA group compared with in the placebo group (6% vs 80%; P < 0.001). Multivariate analysis showed that the dual treatment is a protective strategic therapy against PES development [odds ratio (OR) = 0.04; 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.01-0.20; P < 0.001). Seven (14%) patients in the placebo group, but none in the NAC + DEXA group, developed post-TACE liver decompensation. A dynamic change in Albumin-Bilirubin score of more than 0.5 point was found to be a risk factor for post-TACE liver decompensation (OR = 42.77; 95%CI: 1.01-1810; P = 0.049).

113,Interim efficacy and safety of PD-1 inhibitors in preventing recurrence of hepatocellular carcinoma after interventional therapy.,10.3389/fimmu.2022.1019772,"INTRODUCTION: Locoregional interventional therapy including transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (TACE) and ablation are the current standard of treatment for early-to-mid-stage hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). However, questions remain unanswered regarding the management of recurrence after locoregional treatment. PD-1 inhibitors can block inhibitory signals of T-cell activation and proliferation to reduce the recurrence. We conducted a single-arm phase 2 trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of PD-1 inhibitors following locoregional interventional therapy in HCC patients with high recurrence risk guided by our novel scoring system. METHODS: Patients enrolled initially treated by TACE combined with ablation, then willingly joined the experimental group. One month later, they received the anti-PD-1 adjuvant therapy (intravenous injection of 200 mg), which was repeated every 3 weeks for a total of 4 or 8 cycles. Within this same period, other patients were screened into the control group to match the experimental group by 1:1 based on the propensity score matching method (PSM). The primary endpoint was relapse-free survival (RFS). Secondary endpoints included overall survival (OS) recurrence modality, safety, and quality of life. RESULT: At the time of data cutoff, the median RFS of the control group was 7.0 months while the experimental group had not reached it. Moreover, the 1-year RFS rate was 73.3% in the experimental group and 46.7% in the control group, showing a significant difference (P =0.02). The rate of local tumor progression in the experimental group was clearly lower than that in the control group (P = 0.027). Benefits associated with anti-PD-1 adjuvant therapy were observed in patients with multiple tumors and tumor size ≤2cm. Univariate and multivariate analyses demonstrated that anti-PD-1 adjuvant therapy was an independent favorable prognostic factor for RFS in HCC patients. The most frequent AE observed in this study was RCCEP, and other AEs included diarrhea, hepatotoxicity, rash, pruritus, and fatigue. The incidence of GRADE ≥3 AE and withdrawal in this study was low with no deaths recorded.

However, less than 5% of patients are ultimately candidates as a result of frequent comorbidities and graft shortage. The aim of this study was to evaluate stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) as an ablative treatment for inoperable HCC. METHODS AND MATERIALS: A prospective phase 2 trial included newly diagnosed single HCC lesions that were without extrahepatic extension and that were deemed unsuitable for standard locoregional therapies, with a tumor size ranging from 1 to 6 cm. The SBRT dose was 45 Gy in 3 fractions. Primary endpoint was the local control of irradiated HCC at 18 months, defined by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors. RESULTS: Forty-three patients were treated and evaluable. Median follow-up was 4.0 years (range, 1.2-4.6 years). All 43 patients had cirrhosis; 37 (88%) were Child-Pugh grade A and 5 (12%) grade B (1 missing data). No patients had received prior local treatment. Thirteen patients (31%) presented grade ≥3 acute adverse events, including 8 patients with an abnormality of the liver function tests (19%). Three patients (10%) experienced a decline in Child-Pugh at 3 months post-SBRT. The 18-month local control rate was 98% (95% confidence interval, 85%-99%). The 18-month overall survival rate was 72% (range, 56%-83%). Median overall survival was 3.5 years.

The aim of this cohort study was to analyze rates of HCC recurrence, patient survival, and graft survival after OLT for HCC, comparing recipients of DBD livers (n = 103) with recipients of uncontrolled DCD livers (uDCD; n = 41). No significant differences in tumor size, tumor number, serum alpha-fetoprotein, proportion of patients within Milan criteria, or pre-OLT bridging therapies were identified between groups, although the waitlist period was significantly shorter in the uDCD group (p = 0.040). HCC recurrence was similar between groups. Patient survival was similar between groups, but graft survival was lower in the uDCD group. Multivariate analysis identified recipient age (p = 0.031), pre-OLT bridging therapy (p = 0.024), and HCC recurrence (p = 0.048) as independent risk factors for patient survival and pre-OLT transarterial chemoembolization (p = 0.045) as the single risk factor for HCC recurrence.

116,"Carvedilol to prevent decompensation of cirrhosis in patients with clinically significant portal hypertension stratified by liver stiffness: study protocol for a randomied, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicentre trial in China.",10.1136/bmjopen-2023-081623,"INTRODUCTION: Patients with clinically significant portal hypertension (CSPH) are recommended to be treated with non-selective beta-blockers (ie, carvedilol) to prevent the first hepatic decompensation event by the renewing Baveno VII consensus. CSPH is defined by hepatic venous pressure gradient (HVPG)≥10 mm Hg; however, the HVPG measurement is not widely adopted due to its invasiveness. Liver stiffness (LS)≥25 kPa can be used as a surrogate of HVPG≥10 mm Hg to rule in CSPH with 90% of the positive predicting value in majority aetiologies of patients. A compelling argument is existing for using LS≥25 kPa to diagnose CSPH and then to initiate carvedilol in patients with compensated cirrhosis, and about 5%-6% of patients under this diagnosis criteria may not be benefited from carvedilol and are at risk of lower heart rate and mean arterial pressure. Randomised controlled trial on the use of carvedilol to prevent liver decompensation in CSPH diagnosed by LS remains to elucidate. Therefore, we aimed to investigate if compensated cirrhosis patients with LS≥25 kPa may benefit from carvedilol therapy. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: This study is a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicentre trial. We will randomly assign 446 adult compensated cirrhosis patients with LS≥25 kPa and without any previous decompensated event and without high-risk gastro-oesophageal varices. Patients are randomly divided into two groups, with 223 subjects in group A and 223 subjects in group B. Group A is a carvedilol intervention group, while group B is a placebo group. All patients in both groups will receive aetiology therapies and are followed up at an interval of 6 months. The 3-year incidences of decompensated events of cirrhosis-related and liver-related death are the primary outcome. The secondary outcomes include development of each complication of portal hypertension individually (ascites, variceal bleeding or overt hepatic encephalopathy), development of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis and other bacterial infections, development of new varices, growth of small varices to large varices, delta changes in LS and spleen stiffness, change in hepatic dysfunction assessed by Child-Pugh and model for end-stage liver disease score, change in platelet count, development of hepatocellular carcinoma, development of portal vein thrombosis and adverse events with a 3-year follow-up. A predefined interim analysis will be performed to ensure that the calculation is reasonable.

117,Sedation and Analgesia for Liver Cancer Percutaneous Radiofrequency Ablation: Fentanyl and Oxycodone Comparison.,10.7150/ijms.47067,"Background: Sedation and analgesia use in percutaneous radiofrequency ablation (RFPA) for liver cancer is a necessary part of the procedure; however, the optimal medicine for sedation and analgesia for PRFA remains controversial. The aim of this study was to compare the perioperative pain management, haemodynamic stability and side effects between oxycodone (OXY) and fentanyl (FEN) use in patients under dexmedetomidine sedation. Methods: Two hundred and five adults with an American Society of Anaesthesiologists physical status score of I to II were included in this study. Patients were assigned to the OXY (n=101) or FEN (n=104) group. Radiofrequency ablation was performed under spontaneous breathing and with painless anaesthesia administered intravenously. The outcomes included fluctuations in mean arterial pressure, heart rate, side effects and the perioperative numerical rating scale (NRS). Results: Radiofrequency ablation was successfully performed in 205 patients. No significant differences were observed in mean blood pressure fluctuations between the two groups despite the longer durations of ablation and total sedation time in the OXY group.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: It is an observational retrospective study done between May 2020 and September 2021. The data were collected from 35 patients of advanced HCC who underwent SBRT. Patients of Child Pugh status (CPs) A5-B7 and with a liver reserve of ≥ 700cc were included. Local control (LC), overall survival (OS) and adverse events including decompensation were carefully recorded. RESULTS: In the cohort, Portal vein and IVC tumor thrombosis were present in 33 (94.3%) and 8 (22.85%) patients, respectively. Lung and nodal metastasis were found in 11 (31.4%) and 21 (60%) of patients, respectively. The median gross tumor volume (GTV) was 563cc (range 80-1925cc). The median SBRT dose prescription was 35 Gy (range 25-40 Gy) in 5-10 fractions. Post radiation therapy, there was improvement in pain and discomfort in 24 out of 29 (82.75%) and 18 out of 23 (78%) patients respectively. Also bone metastasis related pain was improved in all 3 (100%) patients. One year LC, and OS were 80% and 30% respectively. On multivariate analysis, the GTV volume > 750cc and PIVKA-II > 8000 mAU/ml remained the predictor factor for poor OS. Post SBRT, change in child-pugh score by 1 point was observed in 7 patients (20%) which was managed conservatively. CONCLUSION: SBRT is a safe and feasible option for BCLC‑C HCC.

RESIN is the first real-life clinical study of this therapy in an Asian cohort. Study objectives were to evaluate the safety and efficacy of (90)Y resin microspheres. METHODS: Adults with HCC or mCRC scheduled to receive SIRT with (90)Y resin microspheres were included. Primary endpoints were best overall response rate (ORR), adverse events, and changes from baseline in liver function. Secondary efficacy endpoints included overall survival (OS). RESULTS: Of 107 enrolled patients, 83 had HCC, and 24 had mCRC. ORR was 55.41% (HCC) and 33.33% (mCRC). Of 58 HCC patients with 6-month post-SIRT data, 13.79% (n = 8) had resection, transplantation, transarterial chemoembolization, or radiofrequency ablation as the result of down-staging or down-sizing of their lesions. One hundred and ten treatment emergent adverse events (TEAEs) were reported in 51 patients, and five serious adverse events (SAEs) were reported in five patients. The most frequent TEAEs were abdominal pain, nausea and decreased appetite (HCC), and abdominal pain, decreased appetite, fatigue, and vomiting (mCRC). Two deaths due to SAEs (probably related to SIRT) were reported, both in patients with extensive HCC, active hepatitis infection, and other comorbidities. Median OS was 24.07 (HCC) and 12.66 (mCRC) months. CONCLUSIONS: Safety and efficacy outcomes with the routine use of SIRT with (90)Y resin microspheres in Taiwan are consistent with published data.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 90 patients were divided into DEB-TACE group (n = 45) and cTACE group (n = 45). The treatment response, overall survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS), and the safety were compared between the two groups. RESULTS: The objective response rate (ORR) in the DEB-TACE group was significantly higher than that in cTACE group at 1, 3, and 6 months of follow-up (P = 0.031, P = 0.003, P = 0.002). The complete response (CR) in DEB-TACE group was significantly higher than that in cTACE group at 3 months (P = 0.036). Survival analysis revealed that, DEB-TACE group had better survival benefits than cTACE group (median OS: 534 days vs. 367 days, P = 0.027; median PFS: 352 days vs. 278 days P = 0.004). The degree of liver function injury was more serious in DEB-TACE group at 1 week, but was similar between the two groups at 1 month. DEB-TACE with CSM caused a high incidence of fever and a severe abdominal pain (P = 0.031, P = 0.037). CONCLUSIONS: DEB-TACE with CSM showed better treatment response and survival benefits than cTACE group. Although a transient more severe liver damage, high incidence of fever and a severe abdominal pain occurred in the DEB-TACE group, it could be resolved through symptomatic treatment.

123,Radiomics analysis of ultrasound to predict recurrence of hepatocellular carcinoma after microwave ablation.,10.1080/02656736.2022.2062463,"OBJECTIVE: To develop and validate an ultrasonic radiomics model for predicting the recurrence and differentiation of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Convolutional neural network (CNN) ResNet 18 and Pyradiomics were used to analyze gray-scale-ultrasonic images to predict the prognosis and degree of differentiation of HCC. METHODS: This retrospective study enrolled 513 patients with HCC who underwent preoperative grayscale-ultrasonic imaging, and their clinical characteristics were observed. Patients were randomly divided into training (n = 413) and validation (n = 100) cohorts. CNN ResNet 18 and Pyradiomics were used to analyze ultrasonic images of HCC and peritumoral images to develop a prognostic and differentiation model. Clinical characteristics were integrated into the radiomics model and patients were stratified into high- and low-risk groups. The predictive effect was evaluated using the C-index and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve. RESULTS: The model combined with ResNet 18 and clinical characteristics achieved a good predictive ability. The C-indices of early recurrence (ER), late recurrence (LR), and recurrence-free survival (RFS) were 0.695 (0.561-0.789), 0.715 (0.623-0.800) and 0.721 (0.647-0.795), respectively, in the validation cohort, which was superior to the clinical model and ultrasonic semantic model. The model could stratify patients into high- and low-risk groups, which showed significant differences (p < 0.001) in ER, LR, and RFS. The area under the curve for predicting the degree of HCC differentiation was 0.855 and 0.709 in the training and validation cohorts, respectively. CONCLUSION: We developed and validated a radiomics model to predict HCC recurrence and HCC differentiation, which could also acquire pathological information in a noninvasive manner.KEY RESULTSA hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) prognostic prediction model was developed and validated by convolutional neural network (CNN) ResNet 18-based gray-scale ultrasound (US).A differentiation of HCC prediction model was developed for preoperative prediction avoiding invasive operation.Compared with Pyradiomics, CNN ResNet was more suitable for extracting information from US images.",Wu JP; Ding WZ; Wang YL; Liu S; Zhang XQ; Yang Q; Cai WJ; Yu XL; Liu FY; Kong D; Zhong H; Yu J; Liang P,False,Does not match PICOS criteria due to lack of specified comparison and intervention not being immune checkpoint inhibitors.,patients with hepatocellular carcinoma,ultrasonic radiomics model,not specified,recurrence and differentiation of HCC,retrospective study,False,Model A's decision is correct.

METHODS: A randomized controlled study was conducted from August 2016 to December 2019 on patients with unresectable HCC and PVTT. The patients were randomly assigned to RT + TACE group or TACE + RT group in a 1:1 ratio. Evaluation of therapeutic effects on the primary tumor was based on the modified Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (mRECIST), while that on PVTT was based on the changing of Cheng's PVTT classification. The primary end-point was overall survival (OS). RESULTS: The 120 patients who entered this study were evenly assigned to two groups. In the intention-to-treat (ITT) population, the OS rates for RT + TACE group at 1, 2 and 3 years were 61.7%, 27.4% and 15.6%, compared with 45.0%, 16.1% and 4.7% in TACE + RT group. The median OS was increased in patients with RT + TACE compared with those who had TACE + RT with a marginally significance (15.4 versus 11.5 months, HR = 0.68, 95% CI 0.46-1.01, p = 0.054). The median progression-free survival (PFS) in RT + TACE group was 6.6 months versus 4.2 months in TACE + RT group (HR = 0.66, 95% CI 0.46-0.96, p = 0.030). The corresponding disease control rate (DCR) at 3 months was 86.7% versus 66.7% (p = 0.017) and 61.7% versus 46.7% (p = 0.099) at 6 months. In subgroup analyses, RT + TACE was associated with better OS (HR, 0.48; 95% CI 0.33-0.99, p = 0.048) and PFS (HR, 0.55; 95% CI 0.33-0.93, p = 0.026) versus TACE + RT among patients with type III/IV PVTT. There were 3 patients in RT + TACE group and 2 in TACE + RT group had adverse events ≥  grade 3.

125,Virtual clinical trials of anti-PD-1 and anti-CTLA-4 immunotherapy in advanced hepatocellular carcinoma using a quantitative systems pharmacology model.,10.1136/jitc-2022-005414,"BACKGROUND: Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the most common form of primary liver cancer and is the third-leading cause of cancer-related death worldwide. Most patients with HCC are diagnosed at an advanced stage, and the median survival for patients with advanced HCC treated with modern systemic therapy is less than 2 years. This leaves the advanced stage patients with limited treatment options. Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) targeting programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) or its ligand, are widely used in the treatment of HCC and are associated with durable responses in a subset of patients. ICIs targeting cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated protein 4 (CTLA-4) also have clinical activity in HCC. Combination therapy of nivolumab (anti-PD-1) and ipilimumab (anti-CTLA-4) is the first treatment option for HCC to be approved by Food and Drug Administration that targets more than one immune checkpoints. METHODS: In this study, we used the framework of quantitative systems pharmacology (QSP) to perform a virtual clinical trial for nivolumab and ipilimumab in HCC patients. Our model incorporates detailed biological mechanisms of interactions of immune cells and cancer cells leading to antitumor response. To conduct virtual clinical trial, we generate virtual patient from a cohort of 5,000 proposed patients by extending recent algorithms from literature. The model was calibrated using the data of the clinical trial CheckMate 040 (ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT01658878). RESULTS: Retrospective analyses were performed for different immune checkpoint therapies as performed in CheckMate 040. Using machine learning approach, we predict the importance of potential biomarkers for immune blockade therapies. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first QSP model for HCC with ICIs and the predictions are consistent with clinically observed outcomes. This study demonstrates that using a mechanistic understanding of the underlying pathophysiology, QSP models can facilitate patient selection and design clinical trials with improved success. commercial re-use.

126,Possible use of Digital Variance Angiography in Liver Transarterial Chemoembolization: A Retrospective Observational Study.,10.1007/s00270-023-03420-2,"PURPOSE: Digital variance angiography (DVA), a recently developed image processing technology, provided higher contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) and better image quality (IQ) during lower limb interventions than digital subtraction angiography (DSA). Our aim was to investigate whether this quality improvement can be observed also during liver transarterial chemoembolization (TACE). MATERIALS AND METHODS: We retrospectively compared the CNR and IQ parameters of DSA and DVA images from 25 patients (65% male, mean ± SD age: 67.5 ± 11.2 years) underwent TACE intervention at our institute. CNR was calculated on 50 images. IQ of every image set was evaluated by 5 experts using 4-grade Likert scales. Both single image evaluation and paired image comparison were performed in a blinded and randomized manner. The diagnostic value was evaluated based on the possibility to identify lesions and feeding arteries. RESULTS: DVA provided significantly higher CNR (mean CNR(DVA)/CNR(DSA) was 1.33). DVA images received significantly higher individual Likert score (mean ± SEM 3.34 ± 0,08 vs. 2.89 ± 0.11, Wilcoxon signed-rank p < 0.001) and proved to be superior also in paired comparisons (median comparison score 1.60 [IQR:2.40], one sample Wilcoxon p < 0.001 compared to equal quality level). DSA could not detect lesion and feeding artery in 28 and 36% of cases, and allowed clear detection only in 22% and 16%, respectively. In contrast, DVA failed only in 8 and 18% and clearly revealed lesions and feeding arteries in 32 and 26%, respectively.

This phase 1b/2 study was designed to determine the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) of GT90001 plus nivolumab, and assess the safety and anti-tumor activity in patients with advanced HCC. METHODS: Patients with advanced HCC were recruited from 3 centers. Eligible patients in the dose de-escalation stage received the GT90001 on day 1 of a 14-day cycle in a rolling-six design with a fixed dose of nivolumab (3.0 mg/kg). Patients in dose-expansion stage received the RP2D of GT90001 plus nivolumab. Primary endpoint was safety. Key secondary endpoint was objective response rate (ORR) as per RECIST 1.1. RESULTS: Between July 9, 2019, and August 8, 2022, 20 patients were treated (6 in phase 1b; 14 in phase 2) and evaluable for analysis. In phase 1b, no dose-limiting toxicities were observed, and GT90001 7.0 mg/kg was confirmed as the RP2D. Common grade 3/4 adverse events (AEs) were platelet count decreased (15%).

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Between November 2013 and February 2016, 13 patients with unresectable HCC (>5 cm), ineligible for other local treatments, with a Child-Pugh score (CPS) ≤ B7, were enrolled into a single-institution phase II study. SBRT was delivered by volumetric-modulated arc radiotherapy. Radiological response was reported using modified Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumours criteria and toxicities graded by Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events v4 criteria. RESULTS: Sixteen hepatomas (median size 7.5 cm, range 5.1-9.7 cm) were treated in 13 patients. The baseline CPS was A5/6 in nine patients (69%) and B7 in four patients (31%). Five patients (38%) received previous liver-directed treatment. The median prescribed dose was 45 Gy (range 40-45 Gy) in five fractions. The median follow-up was 17.7 months. The 1-year local control rate was 92%. The median overall survival was 17.7 months and the 1-year overall survival was 62%. The median time to local progression was not reached. Five patients (39%) had an increase in CPS by two or more points at 3 months. Overall, there were 10 grade 3 acute toxicities occurring in seven patients, of which six were haematological. Quality of life remained clinically stable or improved at 3 months in 61.5% and 53.8% of patients based on the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire Core-30 Global Health Score and Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy - Hepatobiliary version 4 score, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: In our cohort, SBRT to unresectable large HCC tumours provided excellent local control with acceptable toxicities. Regional recurrence remained the major cause of failure.

129,Analysis of phase III clinical trials in metastatic NSCLC to assess the correlation between QoL results and survival outcomes.,10.1186/s12916-023-02953-0,"BACKGROUND: In addition to improving survival outcomes, new oncology treatments should lead to amelioration of patients' quality of life (QoL). Herein, we examined whether QoL results correlated with PFS and OS outcomes in phase III randomized controlled trials (RCTs) investigating new systemic treatments in metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). METHODS: The systematic search of PubMed was conducted in October 2022. We identified 81 RCTs testing novel drugs in metastatic NSCLC and published in the English language in a PubMed-indexed journal between 2012 and 2021. Only trials reporting QoL results and at least one survival outcome between OS and PFS were selected. For each RCT, we assessed whether global QoL was ""superior,"" ""inferior,"" or with ""non-statistically significant difference"" in the experimental arm compared to the control arm. RESULTS: Experimental treatments led to superior QoL in 30 (37.0%) RCTs and inferior QoL in 3 (3.7%) RCTs. In the remaining 48 (59.3%) RCTs, a statistically significant difference between the experimental and control arms was not found. Of note, we found a statistically significant association between QoL and PFS improvements (X(2) = 3.93, p = 0.0473). In more detail, this association was not significant in trials testing immunotherapy or chemotherapy. On the contrary, in RCTs testing target therapies, QoL results positively correlated with PFS outcomes (p = 0.0196). This association was even stronger in the 32 trials testing EGFR or ALK inhibitors (p = 0.0077). On the other hand, QoL results did not positively correlate with OS outcomes (X(2) = 0.81, p = 0.368). Furthermore, we found that experimental treatments led to superior QoL in 27/57 (47.4%) trials with positive results and in 3/24 (12.5%) RCTs with negative results (p = 0.0028). Finally, we analyzed how QoL data were described in publications of RCTs in which QoL outcomes were not improved (n = 51). We found that a favorable description of QoL results was associated with sponsorship by industries (p = 0.0232). CONCLUSIONS: Our study reveals a positive association of QoL results with PFS outcomes in RCTs testing novel treatments in metastatic NSCLC. This association is particularly evident for target therapies. These findings further emphasize the relevance of an accurate assessment of QoL in RCTs in NSCLC.",Servetto A; Di Maio M; Salomone F; Napolitano F; Paratore C; Di Costanzo F; Viscardi G; Santaniello A; Formisano L; Bianco R,False,Does not match PICOS criteria due to population not being hepatocellular carcinoma patients and intervention not being immune checkpoint inhibitors.,patients with metastatic non-small cell lung cancer,new systemic treatments,control arm treatments,"quality of life, progression-free survival, overall survival",phase III randomized controlled trials,False,"Model A's decision is correct.

130,Safety and efficacy of transarterial chemoembolization combined with tyrosine kinase inhibitors and camrelizumab in the treatment of patients with advanced unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma.,10.3389/fimmu.2023.1188308,"OBJECTIVE: This study was aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of transarterial chemoembolization combined with tyrosine kinase inhibitors and camrelizumab in the treatment of unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma and to explore a new therapeutic strategy for the treatment of advanced HCC. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 87 patients aged 18-75 years with at least one measurable lesion per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (version 1.1) were included in the study. TACE was administered as needed, and camrelizumab and TKI medication were initiated within two weeks and one week after TACE, respectively. The primary endpoints were progression-free survival and objective response rate. RESULTS: The 87 patients in this trial were last evaluated on September 28, 2022, and 35.8% were still receiving treatment at the data cutoff. A total of 34 patients (39.1%) died, and the median OS was not reached. The median PFS was 10.5 months (95% CI: 7.8-13.1). The ORR rate was 71.3% (62/87), and the DCR rate was 89.7% (78/87) per mRECIST. According to RECIST version 1.1, the ORR rate was 35.6% (31/87), and the DCR rate was 87.4% (76/87). Ten patients (11.5%) successfully underwent conversion therapy and all achieved R0 resection. Two patients achieved a complete pathological response, four achieved a major pathological response, and four had a partial response. All treatment-related adverse events were tolerated. No serious adverse events were observed, and no treatment-related deaths occurred. CONCLUSIONS: TACE combined with TKI and camrelizumab was safe and effective in treating advanced HCC. Triple therapy may benefit patients with large tumor burden and portal vein cancer thrombus and is expected to provide a new treatment strategy for advanced HCC.

METHODS: In this randomized, open-label, phase II trial, patients with unresectable HCC who were TACE treatment-naïve or experienced recurrence after surgical resection or ablation were enrolled at 7 centers in China from March 2019 to November 2019. Participants were randomly assigned (1:1:1) to receive TACE with chemotherapeutic regimen of dicycloplatin alone (group A1), dicycloplatin plus epirubicin (group A2), or epirubicin alone (group B). The primary endpoint was objective response rate (ORR). The secondary endpoints included disease control rate (DCR), duration of response (DOR), progression-free survival (PFS), and safety. RESULTS: The ORR at 6 months in group A1 (n = 22) was significantly better than that in group B (p = 0.093; 90% confidence interval [CI], 1.03-9.45). The DCR in group A1 was significantly higher than that in group B (p = 0.045; 90% CI, 1.29-12.88). There was no significant difference in DOR among the groups (p = 0.271). The median PFS were 6.00 and 3.05 months in groups A2 (n = 25) and B (n = 24), respectively (p = 0.061). Grade 3 or worse adverse events were similar among groups in the safety population (p = 0.173). CONCLUSION: TACE with dicycloplatin was comparably safe and well tolerable as epirubicin alone in patients with unresectable HCC. Compared with epirubicin alone, significant improvement in ORR and DCR when dicycloplatin was applied, as well as prolonged PFS when dicycloplatin plus epirubicin was applied, was generated. KEY POINTS: • To our knowledge, this is the first multicenter randomized trial to assess the efficacy and safety of TACE with dicycloplatin in patients with unresectable HCC. • This phase II trial showed that TACE with dicycloplatin alone or plus epirubicin was comparably safe and well tolerable as epirubicin alone. • Significant improvements in ORR, DCR when dicycloplatin was applied, and prolonged PFS when dicycloplatin plus epirubicin was applied were recorded compared with epirubicin alone.",Zhu HD; Li X; Ji JS; Huang M; Shao GL; Lu J; Zhao XY; Li HL; Yang ZQ; Tu JF; Zhou JM; Zeng CH; Teng GJ,False,"The intervention does not involve immune checkpoint inhibitors, and the study design is a phase II trial, not a randomized controlled trial as per PICOS criteria.",patients with unresectable HCC,TACE with dicycloplatin alone or plus epirubicin,epirubicin alone,"objective response rate, disease control rate, progression-free survival","randomized, open-label, phase II trial",False,"Model A's decision is correct.

METHODS: A randomized controlled trial (RCT) was conducted with 144 patients, who were randomly assigned to receive either DEB-TACE with doxorubicin-loaded CalliSpheres(®) microspheres or cTACE with doxorubicin-lipiodol emulsion. Patients were followed up for 12 months, with assessments at 3 and 12 months posttreatment. The primary endpoint was the clinical response rate (CR), and the secondary endpoints were the overall survival (OS), the progression-free survival (PFS), and the safety profile of the two treatments. RESULTS: The results showed that DEB-TACE was superior to cTACE in terms of CR (50.0% vs 30.6% at 3 months, p = 0.03; 43.1% vs 25.0% at 12 months, p = 0.04), OS (18.2 months vs 14.6 months, p < 0.05), and PFS (7.4 months vs 4.8 months, p < 0.05), and that the safety profile of the two treatments was similar (p > 0.05 for all comparisons). However, the efficacy of DEB-TACE and cTACE varied according to the tumor morphology. DEB-TACE showed better CR rates in patients with nodular tumors, while no significant difference in CR between the two groups in patients with infiltrative tumors. CONCLUSION: DEB-TACE showed superior efficacy to cTACE in terms of CR, OS, and PFS, particularly in patients with nodular tumors, while maintaining a similar safety profile.

AIMS: To examine the therapeutic effect and immunosuppressor cell alteration in adding TACE to sorafenib. METHODS: Forty-four advanced stage HCC patients were divided into group A (n = 17) treated by sorafenib (400-600 mg/day) alone and group B patients (n = 27) treated by sorafenib and TACE. The frequency of regulatory T-cells and myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSC), and patients' outcomes were examined. Advanced HCC patients' survival was improved by adding TACE to sorafenib if N/L was reduced from ≥2.5 to <2.5 by TACE. RESULTS: The median (interquartile) follow-up for all patients was 8.5 (3.5 to 15.5) with a range from 1 to 71 months. The median (interquartile) survival was 5.0 (2.3-11.3) months for group A and 11.0 (5.0-19.0) months for group B patients (P = .024). In group A, the patients (n = 8) with neutrophil-to-lymphocytes ratio (N/L) < 2.5 had better survival than the patients (n = 9) with N/L ≥ 2.5 (P = .006). In group B, 6 of 13 patients with N/L ≥ 2.5 had N/L reduction to <2.5 after combination therapy of sorafenib and TACE, and their 6-month, 1-year and 2-year survival were improved (P = .013). For immune cell examination, the frequency of CD4(+) and CD8(+) T-lymphocytes, regulatory T-cell and MDSC were not altered by sorafenib treatment.

134,Machine Learning-Based Development of Nomogram for Hepatocellular Carcinoma to Predict Acute Liver Function Deterioration After Drug-Eluting Beads Transarterial Chemoembolization.,10.1016/j.acra.2023.05.014,"RATIONALE AND OBJECTIVES: Acute liver function deterioration (ALFD) following drug-eluting beads transarterial chemotherapy embolism (DEB-TACE) was considered a risk factor for prognosis in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). In this study, we aimed to develop and validate a nomogram for the prediction of ALFD after DEB-TACE. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 288 patients with HCC from a single center were randomly divided into a training dataset (n = 201) and a validation dataset (n = 87). The univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were performed to determine risk factors for ALFD. The least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) was applied to identify the key risk factors and fit a model. The performance, calibration, and clinical utility of the predictive nomogram were assessed using receiver operating characteristic curves, calibration curves, and decision curve analysis (DCA). RESULTS: LASSO regression analysis determined six risk factors with fibrosis index based on four factors (FIB-4) as the independent factor for the occurrence of ALFD after DEB-TACE. Gamma-glutamyltransferase, FIB-4, tumor extent, and portal vein invasion were integrated into the nomogram. In both the training and validation cohorts, the nomogram demonstrated promising discrimination with AUC of 0.762 and 0.878, respectively. The calibration curves and DCA revealed good calibration and clinical utility of the predictive nomogram.

This prespecified exploratory analysis was conducted to evaluate associations between tumor gene expression signatures and clinical outcomes in the phase III KEYNOTE-061 trial. METHODS: Using RNA sequencing data obtained from formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded baseline tumor tissue samples, we evaluated the 18-gene T-cell-inflamed gene expression profile (Tcell(inf)GEP) and 10 non-Tcell(inf)GEP signatures (angiogenesis, glycolysis, granulocytic myeloid-derived suppressor cell (gMDSC), hypoxia, monocytic MDSC (mMDSC), MYC, proliferation, RAS, stroma/epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition/transforming growth factor-β, WNT). The association between each signature on a continuous scale and outcomes was analyzed using logistic (objective response rate (ORR)) and Cox proportional hazards regression (progression-free survival (PFS) and OS). One-sided (pembrolizumab) and two-sided (paclitaxel) p values were calculated for Tcell(inf)GEP (prespecified α=0.05) and the 10 non-Tcell(inf)GEP signatures (multiplicity-adjusted; prespecified α=0.10). RESULTS: RNA sequencing data were available for 137 patients in each treatment group. Tcell(inf)GEP was positively associated with ORR (p=0.041) and PFS (p=0.026) for pembrolizumab but not paclitaxel (p>0.05). The Tcell(inf)GEP-adjusted mMDSC signature was negatively associated with ORR (p=0.077), PFS (p=0.057), and OS (p=0.033) for pembrolizumab, while the Tcell(inf)GEP-adjusted glycolysis (p=0.018), MYC (p=0.057), and proliferation (p=0.002) signatures were negatively associated with OS for paclitaxel. CONCLUSIONS: This exploratory analysis of tumor Tcell(inf)GEP showed associations with ORR and PFS for pembrolizumab but not for paclitaxel. Tcell(inf)GEP-adjusted mMDSC signature was negatively associated with ORR, PFS, and OS for pembrolizumab but not paclitaxel.

136,SIRT Compared with DEB-TACE for Hepatocellular Carcinoma: a Real-world Study (the SITAR Study).,10.1007/s12029-020-00502-z,"BACKGROUND: Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is responsible for 1% of deaths worldwide, and the incidence continues to increase. Despite surveillance programs, 70% of HCC patients are not suitable for curative options at diagnosis, and therefore, non-curative treatments are essential to modern clinical practice. There are many novel treatments, though their roles are not well defined. This study aimed to contrast Selective Internal Radiation Therapy (SIRT) and Drug Eluting Bead Transarterial Chemoembolisation (DEB-TACE) to further define their roles. METHODS: This was a retrospective multicentre cohort study. Factors included for analysis were type of HCC treatment, number of lesions, lesion size, multiple disease severity scores, cirrhosis and vascular invasion. The primary endpoint was transplant-free survival. RESULTS: Transplant-free survival was similar between the two cohorts (p = 0.654), despite a variation in median lesion size, SIRT: 54.5 mm, DEB-TACE: 34 mm (p ≤ 0.001). A univariate Cox proportional hazard model utilising treatment modality as the covariate showed no significant difference in survival (DEB-TACE HR 1.4 (95%CI 0.85-2.15 p = 0.207). The size of the largest lesion was the best predictor of 3-year survival (p = 0.035). Lesion size was inversely associated with survival (HR 1.01 (95%CI 1-1.02, p = 0.025)) on multivariate analysis. CONCLUSION: This study is the first to catalogue the experience of using SIRT in HCC in a real-world Australian population.

137,Priming of Sorafenib Prior to Radiofrequency Ablation Does Not Increase Treatment Effect in Hepatocellular Carcinoma.,10.1007/s10620-021-07156-2,"BACKGROUND: Preclinical studies have shown that modulation of the tumor microvasculature with anti-angiogenic agents decreases tumor perfusion and may increase the efficacy of radiofrequency ablation (RFA) in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Retrospective studies suggest that sorafenib given prior to RFA promotes an increase in the ablation zone, but prospective randomized data are lacking. AIMS: We conducted a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase II trial to evaluate the efficacy of a short-course of sorafenib prior to RFA for HCC tumors sized 3.5-7 cm (NCT00813293). METHODS: Treatment consisted of sorafenib 400 mg twice daily for 10 days or matching placebo, followed by RFA on day 10. The primary objectives were to assess if priming with sorafenib increased the volume and diameter of the RFA coagulation zone and to evaluate its impact on RFA thermal parameters. Secondary objectives included feasibility, safety and to explore the relationship between tumor blood flow on MRI and RFA effectiveness. RESULTS: Twenty patients were randomized 1:1. Priming with sorafenib did not increase the size of ablation zone achieved with RFA and did not promote significant changes in thermal parameters, although it significantly decreased blood perfusion to the tumor by 27.9% (p = 0.01) as analyzed by DCE-MRI. No subject discontinued treatment owing to adverse events and no grade 4 toxicity was observed. CONCLUSION: Priming of sorafenib did not enhance the effect of RFA in intermediate sized HCC. Future studies should investigate whether longer duration of treatment or a different antiangiogenic strategy in the post-procedure setting would be more effective in impairing tumor perfusion and increasing RFA efficacy.

We conducted a phase I study to evaluate the safety of ICI with stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) in patients with metastatic PDAC. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients enrolled must have received at least one line of prior systemic chemotherapy for metastatic disease. Cohorts A1 and A2 received durvalumab every 2 weeks plus either 8 Gy in one fraction of SBRT on day 1 or 25 Gy in five fractions on day -3 to +1. Cohorts B1 and B2 received durvalumab plus tremelimumab every 4 weeks and either 8 Gy in one fraction of SBRT on day 1 or 25 Gy in five fractions on day -3 to +1. ICIs were continued until unacceptable toxicity or disease progression. The primary objective was the safety and feasibility of treatment. Objective response was assessed in lesions not subjected to SBRT. RESULTS: Fifty-nine patients were enrolled and 39 were evaluable for efficacy. No dose-limiting toxicities were seen.

METHODS: A multicenter, randomized controlled trial was conducted in patients with high-risk recurrence factors after curative resection of HCC from 9 medical centers between July 2014 and July 2018. Totally 249 patients were randomly assigned to TACE with or without Cidan Capsule administration groups by stratified block in a 1:1 ratio. Postoperative adjuvant TACE was given 4-5 weeks after hepatic resection in both groups. Additionally, 125 patients in the TACE plus Cidan group were administrated Cidan Capsule (0.27 g/capsule, 5 capsules every time, 4 times a day) for 6 months with a 24-month follow-up. Primary endpoints included disease-free survival (DFS) and tumor recurrence rate (TRR). Secondary endpoint was overall survival (OS). Any drug-related adverse events (AEs) were observed and recorded. RESULTS: As the data cutoff in July 9th, 2018, the median DFS was not reached in the TACE plus Cidan group and 234.0 days in the TACE group (hazard ratio, 0.420, 95% confidence interval, 0.290-0.608; P<0.01). The 1- and 2-year TRR in the TACE plus Cidan and TACE groups were 31.5%, 37.1%, and 60.8%, 63.4%, respectively (P<0.01). Median OS was not reached in both groups. The 1- and 2-year OS rates in TACE plus Cidan and TACE groups were 98.4%, 98.4%, and 89.5%, 87.9%, respectively (P<0.05). The most common grade 3-4 AEs included fatigue, abdominal pain, lumbar pain, and nausea. One serious AE was reported in 1 patient in the TACE plus Cidan group, the death was due to retroperitoneal mass hemorrhage and hemorrhagic shock, and was not related to study drug.

SUBJECTS AND METHODS: From July 2012 to October 2019, 83 consecutive patients with 107 HCC lesions were treated with interventional radiology therapy. The lesions were located at some unusual regions such as diaphragmatic surface, hepatic hilum, hepatic subcapsular region, tissues near inferior vena cava, and tissues near the colon. General anesthesia was applied in 57 cases (general anesthesia group) and local anesthesia plus intraoperative analgesia was used in 26 cases (local anesthesia group). All patients were treated with transcatheter arterial chemoembolization, followed immediately by RFA. The rate of tumor inactivation, time used for placing RF needles to the scheduled sites, pain score, and complications were analyzed. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS USED: All continuous variables were tested for the normal/nonnormal distribution by Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. The t-test was used to analyze the normal distribution variables; the Mann-Whitney U-test was used to measure nonnormal distribution variables; and the Chi-square test for categorical variables. P < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. RESULTS: The treatments were successful in all patients, including 51 cases of complete response (CR) and 6 cases of partial response (PR) in the general anesthesia group and 18 cases of CR and 8 cases of PR in the local anesthesia group (P = 0.049). The time used for placing the needles to the scheduled sites was 1-5 min (mean 2 min) in the general anesthesia group and 2-9 min (mean 4 min) in the local analgesia group (P < 0.001). The pain scores ranged from 0 to 2 points (mean 1 point) in the general anesthesia group and 2-9 points (mean 5 points) in the local anesthesia group (P < 0.001). With regard to complications, seven cases had pneumothorax and four cases had slight hepatic subcapsular hemorrhage in the general anesthesia group and four cases of pneumothorax and three cases of slight hepatic subcapsular hemorrhage in the local anesthesia group, and the difference was not statistically significant between the two groups (P = 0.715).

145,Short-term efficacy assessment of transarterial chemoembolization combined with radioactive iodine therapy in primary hepatocellular carcinoma.,10.4240/wjgs.v15.i1.105,"BACKGROUND: Transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) is an effective treatment for primary hepatocellular carcinoma (PHC). Radioactive iodine therapy has been used in the treatment of advanced PHC, especially in patients with portal vein tumor thrombosis. However, data on the therapeutic effect of TACE combined with radioactive iodine therapy in PHC are scarce. AIM: To investigate the clinical efficacy of TACE combined with radioactive iodine implantation therapy in advanced PHC via perfusion computed tomography (CT). METHODS: For this study, 98 advanced PHC patients were recruited and divided randomly into the study and control groups. Patients in the study group were treated with TACE combined radioactive iodine implantation therapy. Patients in the control group were treated with only TACE. The tumor lesion length, clinical effect, serum alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) and CT perfusion parameters were compared before and after therapy, and statistical analysis was performed. RESULTS: There was no significant difference in tumor length and serum AFP between the study and control groups (P > 0.05) before treatment. However, the tumor length and serum AFP in the study group were lower than those in the control group 1 mo and 3 mo after therapy. After 3 mo of treatment, the complete and partial remission rate of the study group was 93.88%, which was significantly higher than the control group (77.55%) (P < 0.05). Before treatment, there were no significant differences between the two groups on the perfusion CT variables, including the lesion blood volume, permeability surface, blood flow, hepatic artery flow and mean transit time (P > 0.05). After 3 mo of treatment, all perfusion CT variables were lower in the study group compared to the control group (P < 0.05). The survival time of patients in the study group was 22 mo compared to 18 mo in the control group, which was significantly different [log rank (Mantel-Cox) = 4.318, P = 0.038]. CONCLUSION: TACE combined with radioactive iodine implantation in the treatment of advanced PHC can inhibit the formation of blood vessels in tumor tissue and reduce the perfusion level of tumor lesions, thereby improving the clinical efficacy and prolonging the survival time of patients. reserved.",Wang L; Huang K; Zhang Y; Wu YF; Yue ZD; Fan ZH; Liu FQ; Li YW; Dong J,False,Intervention is not immune checkpoint inhibitors.,advanced PHC patients,TACE combined with radioactive iodine implantation therapy,TACE alone,"tumor lesion length, clinical effect, serum AFP, CT perfusion parameters",randomized controlled trial,False,"Model A's decision is correct.

146,Transcatheter arterial chemoembolization using CalliSpheres beads loaded with arsenic trioxide for unresectable large or huge hepatocellular carcinoma: a prospective study.,10.1007/s00330-023-10097-1,"OBJECTIVES: To determine the safety and efficacy of transcatheter arterial chemoembolization with CalliSpheres® beads loaded with arsenic trioxide (CBATO-TACE) in the first-line treatment of patients with large (5 cm ≤ maximum diameter < 10 cm) or huge (maximum diameter ≥ 10 cm) hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). METHODS: Patients were randomly allocated to the CBATO-TACE group and the conventional transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (cTACE) group. The primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS). The secondary endpoint was overall survival (OS), treatment response, and treatment-related adverse events (TRAEs). The extrahepatic collateral arteries, liver function, and liver fibrosis after the first TACE were also evaluated. RESULTS: From September 2018 to September 2020, a total of 207 patients who underwent TACE were consecutively enrolled in this study. The median PFS was 9.5 months (range: 8.0 - 11.0) in the CBATO group, which was significantly longer than that in the cTACE group (6.0 months, range: 4.0-6.0) (p < 0.0001). Patients in the CBATO group had a median OS of 22 months (range: 20.0 - 27.0) compared with 16 months (range: 15.0 - 20.0) in the cTACE group (p = 0.0084). The most common TRAEs were fever (p = 0.043), and nausea and vomiting (p = 0.002), which were more observed in the cTACE group. In addition, the progressive disease time, pulmonary metastasis rate (p = 0.01), the mean number of extrahepatic collateral arteries (p = 0.01), and average number of TACE sessions (p = 0.025) were significantly decreased in the CBATO group. CONCLUSIONS: CBATO-TACE achieved better therapeutic outcomes and similar safety profile compared to cTACE in large or huge HCC patients. Furthermore, CBATO-TACE was able to reduce extrahepatic collateral arteries production and extrahepatic lung metastasis. CLINICAL RELEVANCE STATEMENT: Our study showed that CalliSpheres® beads loaded with arsenic trioxide (CBATO-TACE) were effective and safe for the treatment of large and giant HCC. In addition, CBATO-TACE can reduce lateral hepatic branch artery formation and extrahepatic pulmonary metastasis, which provides a new treatment approach for unresectable HCC. KEY POINTS: • We compare long-term efficacy and safety of transcatheter arterial chemoembolization with CalliSpheres® beads loaded with arsenic trioxide (CBATO-TACE) and conventional transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (cTACE) in patients with large (5 cm ≤ maximum diameter < 10 cm) or huge HCC (maximum diameter ≥ 10 cm). • Compared with cTACE, CBATO-TACE significantly improved therapeutic outcomes, overall survival, and progression-free survival in patients with large or huge HCC.

147,Carvedilol Plus NUC for Patients With HBV-Compensated Cirrhosis Under Virological Suppression: A Randomized Open-Label Trial.,10.14309/ajg.0000000000002569,"INTRODUCTION: Portal hypertension progression can be relieved after controlling the etiology of liver cirrhosis. Whether beta-blockers could additionally enhance the effects during treatment, particularly for small esophageal varices (EV), was unclear. This study aims to assess the efficacy of add-on carvedilol to delay EV progression during anti-hepatitis B virus (HBV) treatment in HBV-related cirrhosis. METHODS: This randomized controlled trial enrolled patients with virologically suppressed HBV-compensated cirrhosis and small/medium EV. The participants were randomly assigned to receive nucleos(t)ide analog (NUC) or carvedilol 12.5 mg plus NUC (1:1 allocation ratio). The primary end point was the progression rate of EV at 2 years of follow-up. RESULTS: A total of 238 patients (small EV, 77.3%) were randomized into 119 NUC and 119 carvedilol plus NUC (carvedilol [CARV] combination group). Among them, 205 patients (86.1%) completed paired endoscopies. EV progression rate was 15.5% (16/103) in the NUC group and 12.7% (13/102) in the CARV combination group (relative risk = 0.79, 95% confidence interval 0.36-1.75, P = 0.567). Subgroup analysis on medium EV showed the CARV combination group had a more favorable effect in promoting EV regression (43.5% vs 13.1%, P = 0.022) than NUC alone, but not in small cases ( P = 0.534). The incidence of liver-related events (decompensation, hepatocellular carcinoma, or death/liver transplantation) within 2 years was similar between the 2 groups (11.2% vs 10.4%, P = 0.881). DISCUSSION: The overall results did not show statistically significant differences between the added carvedilol strategy and NUC monotherapy in preventing EV progression in patients with virologically suppressed HBV-compensated cirrhosis. However, the carvedilol-added approach might offer improved outcomes specifically for patients with medium EV (NCT03736265).",Wang B; Zhou J; Wu X; Sun Y; Li L; Li P; Li M; Jiang W; Xu M; Feng B; Xu X; Cheng J; Xie W; Han T; Wang X; Li H; Piao H; Zhao X; Chen S; Meng T; Guan Q; Meng F; Kong Y; Ou X; Jia J; You H,False,Population and intervention do not match the criteria.,patients with virologically suppressed HBV-compensated cirrhosis and small/medium EV,carvedilol plus NUC,NUC alone,"progression rate of EV, liver-related events",randomized controlled trial,False,"Model A's decision is correct.

The combination of lenvatinib (LEN) and transcatheter arterial chemoembolisation (TACE), termed LEN-TACE sequential therapy, has shown a high response rate and survival benefit in patients with intermediate-stage HCC. This trial aims to evaluate the efficacy and safety of LEN-TACE sequential therapy and the feasibility of surgical resection for intermediate-stage HCC beyond the Up-to-7 criteria. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: This is a multicentre, single-arm, prospective clinical trial. Thirty patients with intermediate-stage HCC beyond the Up-to-7 criteria will be enrolled. Patients eligible for this study will undergo LEN-TACE sequential therapy in which LEN is administered for 4 weeks, followed by TACE, and then further LEN for another 4 weeks. Patients will be assessed for efficacy of LEN-TACE sequential therapy and resectability, and surgical resection will be performed if the HCC is considered radically resectable. The primary outcome of this study is the resection rate after LEN-TACE sequential therapy. The secondary outcomes are the objective response rate of LEN-TACE sequential therapy, safety, curative resection rate, overall survival and recurrence-free survival.

DESIGN: Between January 2013 and January 2020, 512 patients with HCC beyond the Milan criteria who underwent TACE after TIPS were retrospectively recruited from 15 tertiary centers. Patients were randomly sorted into a training set (n = 382) and a validation set (n = 130). Medical data and overall survival were assessed. A prediction model was developed using multivariate Cox regression analyses. Predictive performance and discrimination were evaluated and compared with other prognostic models. RESULTS: Vascular invasion, log(10)(AFP), 1/creatinine, extrahepatic spread, and log(10)(ALT) were the most significant prognostic factors of survival. These five parameters were included in a new VACEA score. This score was able to stratify patients in the training set into four distinct risk grades whose median overall survival were 25.2, 15.1, 8.9, and 6.2 months, respectively. The 6-month, 1-year, 2-year, and 3-year AUROC values and C-index of the VACEA model were 0.819, 0.806, 0.779, 0.825, and 0.735, respectively, and higher than those of other seven currently available models in both the training and validation sets, as well as in different subgroups. CONCLUSION: The VACEA score could stratify post-TIPS patients with HCC beyond the Milan criteria treated by TACE and help to identify candidates who benefit from this treatment. KEY POINTS: • Vascular invasion, AFP, creatinine, extrahepatic spread, and ALT were independent significant prognostic factors of survival for HCC patients who underwent TACE after TIPS. • Our new model, named VACEA score, can accurately predict prognosis at the individual level and stratify patients into four distinct risk grades. • The VACEA model showed better prognostic discrimination and calibration than other current TACE-/TIPS-specific models Graphical abstract.",Fan W; Zhu B; Yue S; Zheng X; Yuan G; Yu L; Huang W; Huang S; Wei W; Li F; Huang Z; Tang R; Fan H; Li Z; Qiao L; Huang F; Cheng Y; Zhang Y; Wu Y; Zou X; Xue M; Wang H; Li J,False,Intervention is not immune checkpoint inhibitors and study design is not randomized controlled trial.,patients with HCC beyond the Milan criteria who underwent TACE after TIPS,TACE,not specified,overall survival,retrospective study,False,Model A's decision is correct.

153,"VB-111 (ofranergene obadenovec) in combination with nivolumab in patients with microsatellite stable colorectal liver metastases: a single center, single arm, phase II trial.",10.1136/jitc-2023-008079,"BACKGROUND: Microsatellite stable colorectal liver metastases (MSS CLM) maintain an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME). Historically, immune-based approaches have been ineffective. VB-111 (ofranergene obadenovec) is a genetically-modified adenoviral vector targeting the TME; its unique dual mechanism induces an immune response and disrupts neovascularization. Checkpoint inhibition may synergize the immune response induced by viral-mediated anti-angiogenic gene therapy. We aimed to examine the safety and antitumor activity of VB-111 and nivolumab in patients with refractory MSS CLM and to characterize immunological treatment-response. METHODS: This was a phase II study of adult patients with histologically-confirmed MSS CLM who progressed on prior therapy. A priming dose of VB-111 1×10(13) viral particles was given intravenously 2 weeks prior to starting biweekly nivolumab 240 mg and continued every 6 weeks. The combination continued until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. The primary objectives were overall response rate and safety/tolerability. Secondary objectives included median overall survival and progression-free survival. Correlative studies were performed on paired tumor biopsies and blood. RESULTS: Between August 2020 and December 2021, 14 patients were enrolled with median age 50.5 years (40-75), and 14% were women. Median follow-up was 5.5 months. Of the 10 evaluable patients, the combination of VB-111 and nivolumab failed to demonstrate radiographic responses; at best, 2 patients had stable disease. Median overall survival was 5.5 months (95% CI: 2.3 to 10.8), and median progression-free survival was 1.8 months (95% CI: 1.4 to 1.9). The most common grade 3-4 treatment-related adverse events were fever/chills, influenza-like symptoms, and lymphopenia. No treatment-related deaths were reported. Qualitative analysis of immunohistochemical staining of paired tumor biopsies did not demonstrate significant immune infiltration after treatment, except for one patient who had exceptional survival (26.0 months). Immune analysis of peripheral blood mononuclear cells showed an increase of PD-1(high)Ki67(high)CD8(+) T cells and HLA-DR(high) T cells after VB-111 priming dose. Plasma cytokines interleukin-10 and tumor necrosis factor-α increased after treatment with both drugs. CONCLUSION: In patients with MSS CLM, VB-111 and nivolumab did not improve overall response rate or survival but were tolerated with minimal toxicities. While challenging to distinguish between antiviral or antitumor, correlative studies demonstrated an immune response with activation and proliferation of CD8(+) T cells systemically that was poorly sustained.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: The treatment and survival parameters of 32 patients with HCC in the caudate lobe, who met the inclusion criteria and had received US-guided percutaneous MWA in our department from November 2010 to October 2015, were retrospectively analyzed. Imaging examination (contrast-enhanced computed tomography or magnetic resonance) 1 month after MWA was used to evaluate the efficacy of US-guided MWA. RESULTS: Thirty-two patients underwent percutaneous MWA for caudate lobe HCC. The average tumor size was 3.42 ± 0.27 (range: 1-6.8) cm. The initial complete ablation (CA) rate was 87.5% (28/32), and the total CA rate was 96.88% (31/32). Furthermore, the median length of hospitalization was 4 days (range: 2-10 days), and no major complication was observed in this study. The overall survival rates were 87.5%, 50%, and 28.13% at 1, 2, and 3 years, respectively. The progression-free survival after MWA was 93.75%, 53.15%, and 28.13% at 6, 12, and 18 months, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: US-guided percutaneous MWA was a safe and effective treatment.

155,Phase 1 trial of apatinib combined with intensity-modulated radiotherapy in unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma.,10.1186/s12885-022-09819-3,"BACKGROUND: To investigate the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of apatinib delivered during and after intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) for unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). METHODS: Patients with unresectable HCC who were not eligible for radiofrequency ablation (RFA), transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (TACE), or residual/ recurrent after the prior local treatment were enrolled. Patients were scheduled to be treated with IMRT at 50-60 Gy/25-30 fractions. Oral apatinib tablets were administered concurrently with IMRT and continued thereafter. We used a 3 + 3 dose-escalation design, with three dose levels of apatinib (250, 500, and 750 mg). Grade 3 or more severe adverse events (AEs) were defined as dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs). The treatment response was calculated using the Modified Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumours. RESULTS: Nine patients with Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer Stage C were included. One patient withdrew from the apatinib 250 mg group and another patient was added. No DLTs occurred in the apatinib 250 mg group. Five patients were included in the apatinib 500 mg group, and 2 cases of DLT (grade 3 leukopenia) were found among them. Dose escalation was terminated and the MTD was determined to be 250 mg. Common grade 1-2 AEs included fatigue, hypertension, dizziness, bone marrow suppression, and hyperbilirubinemia. The median follow-up time for all patients was 16.0 months. Three patients achieved complete response and another three achieved partial response. The objective response rate was 6/9 (66.7%), and the disease control rate was 9/9 (100%). Three patients relapsed out of the radiation field. The median progression-free survival was 17.0 months, and the median overall survival was 16.7 months. CONCLUSIONS: When combined with IMRT, apatinib 250 mg daily was recommended for a phase 2 study of unresectable HCC. The antitumor activity of the combination treatment was encouraging. The safety and efficacy of apatinib combined with IMRT for unresectable HCC should be further investigated in future studies. TRIAL REGISTRATION: Registration No. ChiCTR1800018309 .

In unresectable HCC patients, transcatheter arterial (chemo-) embolization (TAE/TACE) has shown a disease response in 15-55% of cases. Though multiple TAE/TACE courses can be administered in principle, Stereotactic Body Radiotherapy (SBRT) has emerged as an alternative option in the case of local relapse following multiple TAE/TACE courses. Methods: This is a single-center, prospective, randomized, controlled, parallel-group superiority trial of SBRT versus standard TAE/TACE for the curative treatment of the intermediate stage of HCC after an incomplete response following TAE/TACE (NCT02323360). The primary endpoint is 1-year local control (LC): 18 events were needed to assess a 45% difference (HR: 0.18) in favor of SBRT. The secondary endpoints are 1-year Progression-Free Survival (PFS), Distant Recurrence-Free Survival (DRFS), Overall Survival (OS) and the incidence of acute and late complications. Results: At the time of the final analysis, 40 patients were enrolled, 19 (49%) in the TAE/TACE arm and 21 (51%) in the SBRT arm. The trial was prematurely closed due to slow accrual. The 1- and 2-year LC rates were 57% and 36%. The use of SBRT resulted in superior LC as compared to TAE/TACE rechallenge (median not reached versus 8 months, p = 0.0002). PFS was 29% and 16% at 1 and 2 years, respectively. OS was 86% and 62% at 1 year and 2 years, respectively. In the TAE arm, PFS was 13% and 6% at 1 and 2 years, respectively. In the SBRT arm, at 1 and 2 years, PFS was 37% and 21%, respectively. OS at 1 and 2 years was 75% and 64% in the SBRT arm and 95% and 57% in the TACE arm, respectively.

157,Impact of Transarterial Chemoembolization or Hepatic Artery Infusion Chemotherapy on Liver Function after Hepatocellular Carcinoma Resection: An Observational Study.,10.1159/000528750,"INTRODUCTION: Liver surgery leads to a high degree of heterogeneity in the prognosis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients. However, most previous studies focused on the postoperative therapeutic effects of other treatments, with relatively few studies on the impacts on liver function. This study investigated the impact of transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) and hepatic artery infusion chemotherapy (HAIC) on liver function after HCC resection from various angles. METHODS: 138 HCC patients were enrolled, including 27 patients who received TACE and 80 patients who received HAIC. Besides routine treatment such as liver protection and antiviral therapy, 31 patients received no other treatment. The different groups were compared with various biological parameters with four types of scoring methods. RESULTS: In the short term after TACE, the mean (±SD) alanine transaminase and aspartate transaminase values increased by 79.22 ± 117.43 U/L and 66.33 ± 94.54 U/L, respectively (p < 0.01). The mean (±SD) total bilirubin (TBIL) values increased by 4.02 ± 6.08 μmol/L (p < 0.01). The mean (±SD) albumin (ALB) values decreased by 3.54 ± 2.93 g/L (p < 0.001). The mean (±SD) albumin bilirubin (ALBI) scores increased by 0.39 ± 0.22 (p < 0.001). In the short term after HAIC, the mean (±SD) TBIL values increased by 2.11 ± 5.57 μmol/L (p < 0.01). The mean (±SD) ALB values decreased by 2.52 ± 3.26 g/L (p < 0.001), and the mean (±SD) ALBI scores increased by 0.21 ± 0.42 (p < 0.001). In both treatment groups, the long-term liver function was not significantly different from that before treatment and also from that of the untreated group (p > 0.05).

158,An algorithm for simplified hepatitis C virus treatment with non-specialist care based on nation-wide data from Taiwan.,10.1007/s12072-023-10609-7,"BACKGROUND: Both European Association for the Study of the Liver (EASL) and American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases and the Infectious Diseases Society of America (AASLD-IDSA) guidelines recommend simplified hepatitis C virus (HCV) treatment with pan-genotypic sofosbuvir/velpatasvir or glecaprevir/pibrentasvir for eligible patients. This observational study used real-world data to assess these regimens' safety in eligible patients and develop an algorithm to identify patients suitable for simplified treatment by non-specialists. METHODS: 7,677 HCV-infected patients from Taiwan Hepatitis C Registry (TACR) who received at least one dose of sofosbuvir/velpatasvir or glecaprevir/pibrentasvir, and fulfilled the EASL/AASLD-IDSA criteria for simplified treatment were analyzed. Multivariate analysis was conducted on patient characteristics and safety data. RESULTS: Overall, 92.8% (7,128/7,677) of patients achieved sustained virological response and only 1.9% (146/7,677) experienced Grades 2-4 laboratory abnormalities in key liver function parameters (alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, and total bilirubin), with only 18 patients (0.23%) experiencing Grades 3-4 abnormalities. Age > 70 years old, presence of hepatocellular carcinoma, total bilirubin > 1.2 mg/dL, estimated glomerular filtration rate < 60 mL/min/1.73 m(2), and Fibrosis-4 > 3.25 were associated with higher risks of Grades 2-4 abnormalities. Patients with any of these had an odds of 4.53 times than that of those without in developing Grades 2-4 abnormalities (p < 0.01).

We aim to investigate the safety of HBV-TCR-T-cell immunotherapy in advanced HBV-HCC patients who had not met the criteria for liver transplantation. METHODS: We enrolled eight patients with advanced HBV-HCC and adoptively transferred short-lived autologous T cells expressing HBV-specific TCR to perform an open-label, phase 1 dose-escalation study (NCT03899415). The primary endpoint was to evaluate the safety of HBV-TCR-T-cell therapy according to National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (version 4.03) during the dose-escalation process. The secondary endpoint was to assess the efficacy of HBV-TCR-T-cell therapy by evaluating the anti-tumor responses using RECIST criteria (version 1.1) and the overall survival. RESULTS: Adverse events were observed in two participants among the 8 patients enrolled. Only one patient experienced a Grade 3 liver-related adverse event after receiving a dose of 1 × 10(5) HBV-TCR-T cells/kg, then normalized without interventions with immunosuppressive agents. Among the patients, one achieved a partial response lasting for 27.7 months. Importantly, most of the patients exhibited a reduction or stabilization of circulating HBsAg and HBV DNA levels after HBV-TCR-T-cell infusion, indicating the on-target effects. CONCLUSIONS: The adoptive transfer of HBV-TCR-T cells into advanced HBV-HCC patients were generally safe and well-tolerated.

METHODS: In this open-label, single-center, randomized trial (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT04127396), participants with previously untreated HCC and type I-IV PVTT were randomized 1:1 to receive TACE plus lenvatinib (arm L; orally once daily, 12 mg for body weight ≥60 kg or 8 mg for body weight <60 kg) or TACE plus sorafenib (arm S; 400 mg orally twice daily in 28-day cycles). The primary end point was time-to-progression (TTP; time from randomization to disease progression) and secondary end points included objective response rate and toxicity. Prognostic factors were evaluated using a multivariable Cox proportional hazards model. RESULTS: Between December 30, 2018 and May 31, 2020, 64 patients were randomized (arm L, n = 32; arm S, n = 32); most patients had type I/II PVTT (71.9%), and the median target tumor diameter was 9.8 cm (range, 3.8-21.8). After a median follow-up of 16.1 months, patients in arm L had a higher median TTP (4.7 vs 3.1 months; hazard ratio [HR], 0.55; 95% CI, 0.32-0.95; P = .029) and objective response rate (53.1% vs 25.0%, P = .039) versus arm S. Multivariable analysis showed that TACE plus lenvatinib was significantly associated with higher TTP versus TACE plus sorafenib (HR, 0.50; 95% CI, 0.28-0.90; P = .021). Comparable safety profiles were observed in arms L and S. CONCLUSIONS: TACE plus lenvatinib was safe, well tolerated, and had favorable efficacy versus TACE plus sorafenib in patients with advanced HCC with PVTT and large tumor burden. LAY SUMMARY: Hepatocellular carcinoma with portal vein tumor thrombus has a poor prognosis. In addition, most phase 3 trials of drugs for hepatocellular carcinoma exclude patients with major portal vein invasion, and treatment options for these patients are limited. Transarterial chemoembolization has shown promising efficacy in these patients, especially in combination with systemic treatment or radiotherapy.

This study aimed to compare the efficacy and safety of TIPS with endoscopic + β-blocker for prevention of the rebleeding in such patients. METHODS: 106 consecutive advanced HCC patients receiving tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) who had been treated with vasoactive drugs plus endoscopic therapy for variceal bleeding were randomly assigned to receive either TIPS (n = 52) or endoscopic + β-blocker therapy (n = 54) for the prevention of rebleeding. The primary endpoint was variceal rebleeding after randomization. RESULTS: During a median follow-up of 16 months, rebleeding occurred in 14 patients in the endoscopic + β-blocker group and 3 patients in the TIPS group (p < 0.001). Forty-nine patients died (38 in endoscopic + β-blocker group and 11 in TIPS group, p < 0.001).

MATERIAL AND METHODS: In this prospective study (NCT04866290), 100 adults with confirmed mCRC to the liver who were ineligible for resection were enrolled and followed up to 24 months or death. Study outcomes among Salvage (patients not tolerating more cycles of chemotherapy) and Non-salvage patients included overall survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS), objective response (OR), objective response rate (ORR), best tumor response (BTR), adverse events (AEs), and pharmacokinetics of irinotecan and its active metabolite, 7-ethyl-10-hydroxy-camptothecin (SN38). RESULTS: The median age was 66 years (range: 31-89). Median OS was 15.08 months (95% confidence interval [CI]: 12.33-17.25). PFS was 8.52 months (95% CI: 6.0-9.0; p < 0.001). ORR was 42.2% (95% CI: 31.57-53.50) and 35.9% (95% CI: 25.57-47.62) based on modified RECIST (Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors) and RECIST 1.1 criteria. BTR was not significantly different between mRECIST and RECIST (p = 0.745). The Non-salvage group had a statistically significant difference in median OS relative to the Salvage group (15.3 vs. 3 months; p < 0.001). Pharmacokinetic analyses demonstrated no correlation of OS with plasma concentration of irinotecan and SN38 (all p > 0.05).

Ascites group had higher 5-year rate of recompensation than bleeding group (63.3% vs. 46.5%, p = 0.012), respectively. Patients achieving recompensation in ascites group maintained lower rate of second decompensation than these in bleeding group (at year-5: 26.7% vs. 43.3%, p = 0.032). Specifically, recompensated patients in ascites group had predominantly 5-year rate of further ascites (24.0%) and lower rate of further bleeding (6.0%), which differed from the pattern of these in bleeding group, with lower rate of further ascites (16.0%, p = 0.599) and significantly higher rate of further bleeding (33.9%, p < 0.001). Both patients had superior long-term prognosis (death/LT rate at year-5: 0.6% vs. 3.0%, p = 0.196). CONCLUSION: Ascites patients could achieve higher rate of recompensation through antiviral therapy than bleeding patients. Recompensated patients in ascites group had better prognosis in terms of preventing further bleeding.",He Z; Wang B; Wu X; Hu Z; Zhang C; Hao Y; Yang Y; Huang Y; Rao W; Wang J; Zhou J; Xia S; Ou X; Jia J; You H,False,Population and intervention do not match criteria,treatment-naïve HBV-related decompensated patients,antiviral treatment,not specified,recompensation rate and further decompensation,retrospective multi-center study,False,"Model A's decision is correct.

164,Individualized nutritional intervention improves the nutritional status of liver cancer patients after transcatheter arterial chemoembolization.,10.20960/nh.05136,"Introduction: to explore the effect of individualized nutritional intervention on the nutritional status of patients with liver cancer after transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (TACE). Methods: 56 patients who underwent TACE in our hospital from March 2022 to March 2023 were selected as the study subjects. The patients were randomly divided into a control group (28 cases) and an intervention group (28 cases). The control group received routine dietary intervention, while the intervention group received individualized nutritional intervention. We analyzed the body mass index (BMI), nutritional risk screening 2002 (NRS 2002), nutritional status, liver function status, and incidence of complications in two groups of patients before TACE, 3 days after TACE, and 1 month after TACE. Results: on the third day after TACE, the nutritional related indicators of both groups of patients showed a significantly decrease compared to those before TACE (p < 0.05), while the majority of liver function indicators significantly increased (p < 0.05). Compared with those at 3 days after TACE, the nutritional status of the intervention group patients significantly improved (p < 0.05) and liver function indicators significantly decreased (p < 0.05) 1 month after TACE. One month after TACE, all nutritional indicators in the intervention group were significantly higher than those in the control group (p < 0.05), and AST was significantly lower than that in the control group (p < 0.05). The incidence of gastrointestinal complications and electrolyte disorders in the intervention group were significantly lower than that in the control group (p < 0.05).

165,Axitinib in combination with radiotherapy for advanced hepatocellular carcinoma: a phase I clinical trial.,10.1186/s13014-020-01742-w,"BACKGROUND: To investigate maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of axitinib, a selective vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 1-3 inhibitor, in combination with radiotherapy (RT) for advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). METHODS: This phase I study followed the rule of traditional 3 + 3 design. Major eligibility included: (1) patients with advanced HCC unsuitable for surgery, radiofrequency ablation or transarterial chemoembolization, or who failed after prior local-regional treatment; (2) failure on sorafenib or no grant for sorafenib from health insurance system. Eligible patients with advanced HCC received axitinib for total 8 weeks during and after RT. Three cohorts with axitinib dose escalation were planned: 1 mg twice daily (level I), 2 mg twice daily (level II) and 3 mg twice daily (level III). The prescribed doses of RT ranged from 37.5 to 67.5 Gy in 15 fractions to liver tumor(s) and were determined based on an upper limit of mean liver dose of 18 Gy (intended isotoxic RT for normal liver). The primary endpoint was MTD of axitinib in combination with RT. The secondary endpoints included overall response rate (ORR), RT in-field response rate, acute and late toxicities, overall survival (OS) and progression free survival (PFS). RESULTS: Total nine eligible patients received axitinib dose levels of 1 mg twice daily (n = 3), 2 mg twice daily (n = 3) and 3 mg twice daily (n = 3). Dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) did not occur in the 3 cohorts; the MTD was defined as 3 mg twice daily in this study. ORR was 66.7%, including 3 complete responses and 3 partial responses, at 3 months after treatment initiation. With a median follow-up of 16.6 months, median OS was not reached, 1-year OS was 66.7%, and median PFS was 7.4 months. CONCLUSIONS: Axitinib in combination with RT for advanced HCC was well tolerated with an axitinib MTD of 3 mg twice daily in this study.

166,Acetic acid versus radiofrequency ablation for the treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma: A randomized controlled trial.,10.1016/j.diii.2019.06.011,"PURPOSE: The purpose of this prospective study was to compare the efficacy of percutaneous acetic acid (PAAI) to that of radiofrequency ablation (RFA) in the treatment of small (≤5cm) hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) using a randomized trial. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Consecutive patients with small HCC underwent clinical, biochemical, and imaging evaluation. Those fulfilling the inclusion criteria (Child's A/B cirrhosis, less than 5 HCC nodules, HCC nodules≤5cm diameter, no extrahepatic disease, patent portal vein, normal coagulation profile with informed consent) were randomly assigned to receive RFA or PAAI. Tumor response and survival rate were estimated. Non-inferiority margin of 10% difference was taken for effectivity of PAAI compared to RFA. RESULTS: Of the 86 patients screened, 55 patients with 67 HCC nodules were included. There were 40 men and 15 women with a mean age of 54.3±10.5 (SD) years (range: 28-71years). Of these, 26 patients had PAAI and 29 had RFA. The clinical, demographic and imaging profiles of the two groups were similar. Complete response was non-inferior to RFA [PAAI 75% and RFA 83.3%, difference 8.3% CI (-12.5% to 29.2%)]. Lower limit of this 95% CI (-12.5%) was lower than the 10% non-inferiority margin difference (8.3%). Survival rates were similar at 12months (PAAI, 81.6% vs. RFA, 71.9%; P=0.68) and at 30months (PAAI, 54.4% vs. RFA, 52%; P=0.50). CONCLUSION: PAAI and RFA have similar efficacy in treating small HCC.

167,Liver function after combined selective internal radiation therapy or sorafenib monotherapy in advanced hepatocellular carcinoma.,10.1016/j.jhep.2021.07.037,"BACKGROUND & AIMS: SORAMIC is a previously published randomised controlled trial assessing survival in patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma who received sorafenib with or without selective internal radiation therapy (SIRT). Based on the per-protocol (PP) population, we assessed whether the outcome of patients receiving SIRT+sorafenib vs. sorafenib alone was affected by adverse effects of SIRT on liver function. METHODS: The PP population consisted of 109 (SIRT+sorafenib) vs. 173 patients (sorafenib alone). Comparisons were made between subgroups who achieved a significant survival benefit or trend towards improved survival with SIRT and the inverse group without a survival benefit: <65 years-old vs. ≥65 years-old, Child-Pugh 5 vs. 6, no transarterial chemoembolisation (TACE) vs. prior TACE, no cirrhosis vs. cirrhosis, non-alcohol- vs. alcohol-related aetiology. The albumin-bilirubin (ALBI) score was used to monitor liver function over time during follow-up. RESULTS: ALBI scores increased in all patient groups during follow-up. In the PP population, ALBI score increases were higher in the SIRT+sorafenib than the sorafenib arm (p = 0.0021 month 4, p <0.0001 from month 6). SIRT+sorafenib conferred a survival benefit compared to sorafenib alone in patients aged <65 years-old, those without cirrhosis, those with Child-Pugh 5, and those who had not received TACE. A higher increase in ALBI score was observed in the inverse subgroups in whom survival was not improved by adding SIRT (age ≥65 years-old, p <0.05; cirrhosis, p = 0.07; Child-Pugh 6, p <0.05; prior TACE, p = 0.08). CONCLUSION: SIRT frequently has a negative, often subclinical, effect on liver function in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma, which may impair prognosis after treatment. Careful patient selection for SIRT as well as prevention of clinical and subclinical liver damage by selective treatments, high tumour uptake ratio, and medical prophylaxis could translate into better efficacy. CLINICAL TRIAL NUMBER: EudraCT 2009-012576-27, NCT01126645 LAY SUMMARY: This study of treatments in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma found that selective internal radiation therapy (SIRT) has an adverse effect on liver function that may affect patient outcomes. Patients should be carefully selected before they undergo SIRT and the treatment technique should be optimised for maximum protection of non-target liver parenchyma. Elsevier B.V.

168,Progression patterns and therapeutic sequencing following immune checkpoint inhibition for hepatocellular carcinoma: An international observational study.,10.1111/liv.15502,"BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Different approaches are available after the progression of disease (PD) to immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), including the continuation of ICI, treatment switching to tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) and cessation of anticancer therapy. We sought to characterise the relationship between radiological patterns of progression and survival post-ICI, also appraising treatment strategies. METHODS: We screened 604 HCC patients treated with ICIs, including only those who experienced PD by data cut-off. We evaluated post-progression survival (PPS) according to the treatment strategy at PD and verified its relationship with radiological patterns of progression: intrahepatic growth (IHG), new intrahepatic lesion (NIH), extrahepatic growth (EHG), new extrahepatic lesion (NEH) and new vascular invasion (nVI). RESULTS: Of 604 patients, 364 (60.3%) experienced PD during observation. Median PPS was 5.3 months (95% CI: 4.4-6.9; 271 events). At the data cut-off, 165 patients (45%) received no post-progression anticancer therapy; 64 patients (17.6%) continued ICI beyond PD. IHG (HR 1.64 [95% CI: 1.21-2.22]; p = .0013) and nVI (HR 2.15 [95% CI: 1.38-3.35]; p = .0007) were associated with shorter PPS. Multivariate models adjusted for progression patterns, treatment line and albumin-bilirubin grade and Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status at PD confirmed receipt of ICI beyond PD with (HR 0.17, 95% CI: 0.09-0.32; p < .0001) or without subsequent TKI (HR 0.39, 95% CI: 0.26-0.58; p < .0001) as predictors of prolonged PPS versus no anticancer therapy. CONCLUSIONS: ICI-TKI sequencing is a consolidated option in advanced HCC. nVI and IHG predict a poorer prognosis.

169,Chemoembolization combined radiofrequency ablation vs. chemoembolization alone for treatment of beyond the Milan criteria viable hepatocellular carcinoma (CERFA): study protocol for a randomized controlled trial.,10.1186/s13063-023-07266-4,"BACKGROUND: Many previous studies evaluated a combination of transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (TACE) and radiofrequency ablation (RFA) for treating early hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC); however, studies evaluating combination therapy for beyond-the-Milan criteria HCC are scarce. METHODS: A total of 120 patients with beyond-the-Milan criteria HCC who have viable tumour after first TACE will be enrolled in this multi-institutional, parallel, pragmatic, randomized controlled trial. Patients with metastasis, vascular invasion, or a sum of tumour diameter > 8 cm will be excluded. Eligible patients will be randomly assigned to combination TACE and RFA therapy or TACE monotherapy groups. Patients in the combination therapy group will receive a second TACE and subsequent RFA at the viable tumour. Patients in the TACE monotherapy group will receive only second TACE. Patients in both groups will undergo magnetic resonance imaging 4-6 weeks after second TACE. The primary endpoint is 1-month tumour response, and secondary endpoints are progression-free survival, overall response rate, number of treatments until CR, overall survival, and change in liver function. DISCUSSION: Although TACE can be used to treat intermediate-stage HCC, it is difficult to achieve CR by first TACE in most intermediate-stage patients. Recent studies show a survival advantage of combination therapy over monotherapy. However, most studies evaluating combination therapy included patients with a single tumour sized < 5 cm, and no studies included patients with intermediate-stage but more advanced (i.e., beyond-the-Milan criteria) HCC. This study will evaluate the efficacy of combined TACE and RFA therapy for patients with advanced HCC within the intermediate stage.

170,Phase 1b study of galunisertib and ramucirumab in patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma.,10.1002/cam4.3880,"BACKGROUND: Preclinical data suggest that vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and transforming growth factor (TGF)-β signaling interact to stimulate angiogenesis and suppress antitumor immune responses. Thus, combined inhibition of both pathways may offer greater antitumor activity compared with VEGF-targeted antiangiogenic monotherapy against hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). METHODS: This is a multicenter, open-label, phase 1b study of galunisertib, an inhibitor of TGF-β receptor 1, and ramucirumab, an anti-VEGF receptor 2 antibody, in patients with advanced HCC aiming to define the maximum tolerated dose (MTD). Secondary objectives included safety, pharmacokinetics (PK), antitumor efficacy, and plasma alpha-fetoprotein and TGF-β kinetics. Dose escalation employed a 3 + 3 design. Patients received galunisertib at 80 mg (cohort 1) or 150 mg (cohort 2) orally twice a day on days 1-14 of a 28-day cycle combined with ramucirumab 8 mg/kg intravenously every 2 weeks. RESULTS: Eight patients were enrolled: three in cohort 1 and five in cohort 2 (two patients were unevaluable due to rapid disease progression and replaced). No dose-limiting toxicities were observed. Treatment-related adverse events (AEs) of any grade in ≥2 patients included nausea (25%) and vomiting (25%). There was one Grade 3 treatment-related AE, a cerebrovascular accident possibly related to ramucirumab. Galunisertib exposure was dose-proportional and not affected by ramucirumab. The RECIST version 1.1 objective response rate and disease control rate were 0% and 12.5%, respectively. CONCLUSION: Combination therapy was safe and tolerable and displayed favorable PK. The MTD was established at galunisertib at 150 mg orally twice a day and ramucirumab 8 mg/kg intravenously every 2 weeks. The results do not support the preclinical hypothesis that blocking TGFβ signaling enhances efficacy of VEGF-targeted therapy; thus further clinical development was halted for the combination of galunisertib and ramucirumab.",Harding JJ; Do RK; Yaqubie A; Cleverly A; Zhao Y; Gueorguieva I; Lahn M; Benhadji KA; Kelley RK; Abou-Alfa GK,False,Does not specify comparison or focus on survival/response rate as primary outcomes.,patients with advanced HCC,galunisertib and ramucirumab,not specified,"safety, pharmacokinetics, antitumor efficacy","multicenter, open-label, phase 1b study",False,"Model A's decision is correct.

AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: This study was to evaluate the short term clinical efficacy, side effects, and risk factors affecting the clinical effectiveness of CalliSpheres drug loaded bead transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (DEB TACE) in the treatment of primary hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 172 consecutive patients with HCC undergoing DEB TACE (loaded with doxorubicin) from January 2017 to December 2018 were prospectively enrolled. Short term local tumor response was evaluated by the modified RECIST criteria. Postoperative complications and liver function disorders were analyzed based on examinations and clinical symptoms. RESULTS: The median follow up period was 310 days. Based on the modified response evaluation criteria in solid tumors criteria, objective response rates(complete response [CR] + partial response [PR]) were 78.7%, 71.6%, and 63.2%, and disease control rates(CR + PR + stable disease) were 95.3%, 92.1%, and 85.9% at 2, 4, and 6 months posttreatment, respectively. Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that nodule number >3, high BCLC stage, no vascular leak, and previous conventional TACE treatment were associated with poor ORR (P < 0.05). Postoperation, liver function showed transient changes. Postoperative complications were tolerated and relieved by symptomatic treatment. The average interval of TACE before D TACE was 43 days, compared with 70 days for average interval of DEB TACE. The average hospital stay was 1.87 days. CONCLUSION: DEB TACE has improved short term efficacy and lower incidence of complications in primary HCC and prolongs the interval of TACE. It significantly increases the ORR, especially in patients with no extra hepatic metastasis pretreatment. DEB usage actually improves treatment efficacy and provides more benefits to patients.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Fifty-four patients with untreated advanced HCC who could not be resected were randomly divided into the ANL group (n = 27) and ANL+S-1 group (n = 27). The ANL group was given 10 mg ANL orally once a day for 14 consecutive days, stopped for 1 week, and repeated every 21 days. The ANL+S-1 group was given 10 mg ANL once a day orally and 40 mg S-1 twice a day orally for 14 consecutive days, stopped for 1 week, repeated every 21 days. All patients were treated until the disease progressed or toxicity became unacceptable. For patients who could not tolerate adverse reactions, the ANL dose should be reduced to 8 mg per day. CT or MRI was reviewed every 6 weeks to evaluate the efficacy. RESULTS: A total of 44 patients were included in the results analysis, including 22 patients in the ANL group and 22 patients in the ANL+S-1 group.

174,Immunosuppressive Drug-Resistant Armored T-Cell Receptor T Cells for Immune Therapy of HCC in Liver Transplant Patients.,10.1002/hep.31662,"BACKGROUND AND AIMS: HBV-specific T-cell receptor (HBV-TCR) engineered T cells have the potential for treating HCC relapses after liver transplantation, but their efficacy can be hampered by the concomitant immunosuppressive treatment required to prevent graft rejection. Our aim is to molecularly engineer TCR-T cells that could retain their polyfunctionality in such patients while minimizing the associated risk of organ rejection. APPROACH AND RESULTS: We first analyzed how immunosuppressive drugs can interfere with the in vivo function of TCR-T cells in liver transplanted patients with HBV-HCC recurrence receiving HBV-TCR T cells and in vitro in the presence of clinically relevant concentrations of immunosuppressive tacrolimus (TAC) and mycophenolate mofetil (MMF). Immunosuppressive Drug Resistant Armored TCR-T cells of desired specificity (HBV or Epstein-Barr virus) were then engineered by concomitantly electroporating mRNA encoding specific TCRs and mutated variants of calcineurin B (CnB) and inosine-5'-monophosphate dehydrogenase (IMPDH), and their function was assessed through intracellular cytokine staining and cytotoxicity assays in the presence of TAC and MMF. Liver transplanted HBV-HCC patients receiving different immunosuppressant drugs exhibited varying levels of activated (CD39(+) Ki67(+) ) peripheral blood mononuclear cells after HBV-TCR T-cell infusions that positively correlate with clinical efficacy. In vitro experiments with TAC and MMF showed a potent inhibition of TCR-T cell polyfunctionality. This inhibition can be effectively negated by the transient overexpression of mutated variants of CnB and IMPDH. Importantly, the resistance only lasted for 3-5 days, after which sensitivity was restored. CONCLUSIONS: We engineered TCR-T cells of desired specificities that transiently escape the immunosuppressive effects of TAC and MMF.

175,Atezolizumab plus bevacizumab treatment for unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma progressing after molecular targeted therapy: A multicenter prospective observational study.,10.1097/MD.0000000000030871,"To evaluate the efficacy of atezolizumab plus bevacizumab treatment in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) previously treated with molecular targeted agents (MTAs). Thirty-one patients treated with atezolizumab plus bevacizumab for unresectable HCC and previously treated with MTAs were enrolled in this study. The treatment lines ranged from second to sixth lines. The treatment effect on HCC differed from that during first-line treatment. The treatment effect was determined using the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) and modified RECIST. The treatment response was different for each MTA immediately prior to atezolizumab + bevacizumab treatment. Tumors treated with lenvatinib followed by atezolizumab + bevacizumab showed rapid growth for a short period of time followed by shrinkage. However, patients who received ramucirumab, sorafenib, and regorafenib did not show such changes.

176,Efficacy of doxorubicin and lipiodol therapy by trans-arterial chemoembolization in hepatocellular carcinoma Egyptian patients and relation to genetic polymorphisms.,10.1080/14737140.2024.2391364,"BACKGROUND: Genetic polymorphisms play a crucial role in predicting treatment efficacy in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). This study aims to evaluate the response to Transarterial Chemoembolization (TACE) in relation to the genetic polymorphisms of interleukin 28B (IL28B) and angiopoietin-2 (ANGPT2) in HCC patients. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Prospective cohort study conducted on 104 eligible HCC Egyptian patients who underwent TACE using doxorubicin and lipiodol. Genotyping of the IL28B and ANGPT2 genes was performed with laboratory data analysis. RESULTS: At baseline IL28B rs12979860 genotypes C/T, C/C and T/T appeared in 43.9%, 34.6% and 21.5% while ANGPT2 rs55633437 genotypes C/C, C/A and A/A found in 71.03%, 28.04% and 0.93% of patients respectively. After one month of therapy, 51.4% of patients achieved a complete response. There was a significant difference in relation to IL28B rs12979860 genotypes (p = 0.017) whereas ANGPT2 rs55633437 genotypes (p = 0.432) showed no significant difference in patient response after one month of TACE. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates the effectiveness of TACE in Egyptian HCC patients, as evidenced by low recurrence rates. Furthermore, the IL28B rs12979860 (C/T) gene may be associated with the efficacy and prognosis of TACE treatment in HCC Egyptian patients.

179,Patterns and Outcomes in Hepatocellular Carcinoma Patients with Portal Vein Invasion: A Multicenter Prospective Cohort Study.,10.1007/s10620-020-06134-4,"BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Sorafenib is a proven first-line treatment recommended for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients with portal vein invasion (PVI). However, multiple treatment modalities are used in clinical practice as a first-line option. This study is a prospective, observational, multicenter, cohort study evaluating patterns of treatment modalities and outcomes for HCC patients with PVI. METHODS: The baseline characteristics, treatment modalities, and outcomes were prospectively collected for 287 newly diagnosed HCC patients with PVI between August 2015 and July 2016 from 16 sites in Korea. RESULTS: During a median 7.8 months of follow-up (range 0.3-24.6 months), mortality was observed in 123 (42.9%) patients. Decision tree analysis classified patients into five subgroups with different outcomes. The patterns of treatment were very heterogeneous, and there was no dominant treatment modality. The most commonly used treatment modality was transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) (20.2%) followed by TACE plus external beam radiation therapy (17.8%) and sorafenib (12.5%). When stratified according to the extent of PVI, sorafenib treatment showed comparable outcomes when the PVI extent was lobal or main/bilateral, yet showed worse outcomes when the PVI extent was limited to the segmental level compared to those who received treatment other than sorafenib. CONCLUSIONS: HCC patients with PVI comprise a heterogeneous population and are treated with various treatment modalities with diverse clinical outcomes in clinical practice.

The patients were divided into 4 groups based on the severity of posttransarterial chemoembolization (TACE) fever according to the degrees of body temperature. Univariate analysis and multivariate logistics regression were performed to identify potential risk factors for post-TACE fever.In the stepwise multiple regression analysis, pre-TACE blood urea, small particle size and Cental liqefction (P < .05) were independent risk factors of severe post-TACE fever (P < .05, respectively). Portal vein thrombosis (P < .01), Child-Pugh stage (P < .01), and cycles of DEB-TACE (P < .05) were independent risk factors for clinical death, PEF was not associated with clinical death (P = .754) and 6-month survival (P = .524) in the univariate analysis. Moreover, multivariate Cox regression was performed, and Child-Pugh stage (B vs A) (P = .040) and portal vein thrombosis (yes vs no) (P = .033) were independent factors predicting unfavorable overall survival in HCC patients.Pre-TACE blood urea, small particle size, and Cental liqefction were significantly correlated with the occurrence fever after DEB-TACE.

METHODS AND MATERIALS: This phase 2 study prospectively investigated the efficacy and safety of IGPT and quality of life (QoL) after IGPT for operable/ablatable HCC. The primary endpoint was overall survival, and the secondary endpoints were local control, incidence of grade ≥3 adverse events, and changes in QoL. Toxicities were evaluated with Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, version 4.0. QoL scores were assessed with European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire, version 3.0, and Quality of Life Questionnaire-Hepatocellular Carcinoma/Primary Liver Cancer Module. IGPT was performed using respiratory-gated techniques. RESULTS: Forty-five patients (median age: 68 years; range, 36-80 years) were enrolled between June 2013 and February 2016; 38 were considered operable and 14 were indicated for radiofrequency ablation. The major underlying liver diseases were hepatitis B (n = 16), hepatitis C (n = 13), alcoholic hepatitis (n = 3), and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (n = 13). The Child-Pugh score was A5 in 32 patients, A6 in 9 patients, and B7 in 4 patients. Thirty-seven patients with a peripherally located tumor were given 66 Gy relative biological effectiveness in 10 fractions, and 8 patients with a centrally located tumor received 72.6 Gy relative biological effectiveness in 22 fractions. The median follow-up period of surviving patients was 60 months (range, 42-75 months). Two- and 5-year overall survival rates were 84% (95% confidence interval [CI], 74%-95%) and 70% (95% CI, 56%-84%), respectively, and local control rates were 95% (95% CI, 89%-100%) and 92% (95% CI, 84%-100%), respectively. Grade 3 radiation-induced liver disease was observed in 1 patient. No significant changes were noted in QoL scores 1 year after treatment, except for body image.

Therefore, the authors evaluated the safety and efficacy of SBRT for patients with HCC in a hepatitis B virus-endemic area. METHODS: This multicenter phase 2 trial enrolled patients with unresectable HCC. Patients received SBRT with 45 to 60 Gy in 3 fractions. To evaluate gastroduodenal toxicity, esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) was performed before and 2 months after SBRT. The primary endpoint was treatment-related severe toxicity at 1 year after SBRT. The secondary endpoints were the 2-year local control, progression-free survival, and overall survival rates. RESULTS: In total, 74 patients were enrolled between January 2012 and April 2015, and 65 eligible patients were analyzed. One patient experienced radiation-induced liver disease with acute grade ≥3 toxicity 1 month after SBRT. In addition, 1 patient had a grade 3 esophageal ulcer with stenosis 5 months after SBRT.

Seventy-three patients with HCC treated with a multipolar RFA system (1 electrode, n = 2; 2 electrodes, n = 56; 3 electrodes, n = 17) were enrolled in this retrospective cohort study. To analyze their therapeutic outcome in this study, we divided among 17 patients using 3 electrodes into 2 subgroups: the C-arm type X-ray fluoroscopy-assisted (n = 7) and the US-guided alone groups (n = 10). Therapeutic efficacy and safety were analyzed between the 2 groups. Multipolar RFA treatment was performed safely in all cases, and no severe adverse events occurred.

However, during the interventional procedure, occupational radiation protection is compromised. The use of real-time radiation dosimetry could provide instantaneous radiation doses. This study aimed to evaluate the occupational dose of the medical staff using a real-time radiation dosimeter during transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) for HCC, and to investigate factors affecting the radiation exposure dose.This retrospective observational study included 70 patients (mean age: 66 years; age range: 38-88 years; male: female = 59: 11) who underwent TACE using real-time radiation dosimetry systems between August 2018 and February 2019.

Transarterial chemoembolization combined with programmed cell death protein-1 inhibitors and lenvatinib has also shown preliminary efficacy in the unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma. We conducted this observational, retrospective, cohort study to compare the clinical outcomes and safety of transarterial chemoembolization combined with programmed cell death protein-1 inhibitors plus lenvatinib versus programmed cell death protein-1 inhibitors plus lenvatinib in patients with unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma. Methods: Between November 2019 and November 2021, patients who were diagnosed with unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma and received transarterial chemoembolization combined with programmed cell death protein-1 inhibitors plus lenvatinib or programmed cell death protein-1 inhibitors plus lenvatinib treatment were reviewed for eligibility. The primary endpoints included objective response rate, overall survival, and progression-free survival. The secondary endpoint was the frequency of key adverse events. Results: In total, 105 patients were eligible for the present study, and they were divided into the transarterial chemoembolization combined with programmed cell death protein-1 inhibitors plus lenvatinib group (n = 46) and the programmed cell death protein-1 inhibitors plus lenvatinib group (n = 59). The patient cohort after a one-to-one propensity score matching (n = 86) was also analyzed. The transarterial chemoembolization combined with programmed cell death protein-1 inhibitors plus lenvatinib group had a higher objective response rate both in the patient cohort before propensity score matching (54.3% vs 25.4%, P = .002) and after propensity score matching (55.8% vs 30.2%, P = .017). The patients in the transarterial chemoembolization combined with programmed cell death protein-1 inhibitors plus lenvatinib group had prolonged overall survival (median, 20.5 vs 12.6 months, P = .015) and progression-free survival (median, 10.2 vs 7.4 months, P = .035). For patient cohort- propensity score matching, the overall survival (20.5 vs 12.8 months, P = .013) and progression-free survival (12.1 vs 7.8 months, P = .030) were also significantly better in the transarterial chemoembolization combined with programmed cell death protein-1 inhibitors plus lenvatinib group than in the programmed cell death protein-1 inhibitors plus lenvatinib group. There were no significant differences between the 2 groups concerning adverse reactions caused by immunotherapy and lenvatinib.

187,Does autoimmune disease impair the survival of hepatocellular carcinoma patients undergoing liver resection? A multi-institutional observational study.,10.1007/s00432-024-05885-1,"BACKGROUND: Patients with autoimmune diseases (AD) generally carry an increased risk of developing cancer. However, the effect of AD in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients receiving surgical treatment is uncertain. The present study aimed to investigate the potential influence of AD on the survival of HCC patients undergoing hepatectomies. METHODS: Operated HCC patients were identified from the Chang Gung Research Database, and the survival outcomes of HCC patients with or without AD were analyzed ad compared. Cox regression model was performed to identify significant risk factors associated with disease recurrence and mortality. RESULTS: From 2002 to 2018, a total of 5532 patients underwent hepatectomy for their HCC. Among them, 229 patients were identified to have AD and 5303 were not. After excluding cases who died within 30 days of surgery, the estimated median overall survival (OS) was 43.8 months in the AD (+) group and 47.4 months in the AD (-) group (P = 0.367). The median liver-specific survival and disease-free survival (DFS) were also comparable between the two groups. After Cox regression multivariate analysis, the presence of AD did not lead to a higher risk of all-cause mortality, liver-specific mortality, or disease recurrence. CONCLUSION: Our study demonstrated that autoimmune disease does not impair the OS and DFS of HCC patients undergoing liver resections. AD itself is not a risk factor for tumor recurrence after surgery. Patients eligible for liver resections, as a result, should be considered for surgery irrespective of the presence of AD.

The hazard rate of recurrence was calculated using the hazard function. RESULTS: The hazard rate of intrahepatic recurrence was higher than that of extrahepatic recurrence (0.0588 vs. 0.0301), and both showed a decreasing trend, and the intrahepatic recurrence and extrahepatic recurrence risk decreased to a lower level after 40 and 20 months, respectively. Patients who underwent anatomic resection had a consistently lower hazard rate of recurrence than patients who underwent nonanatomic resection, whereas patients who received postoperative adjuvant transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) mainly had a lower hazard rate of recurrence in the first year than patients who did not. CONCLUSION: The follow-up of BDTT patients should be at least 40 months because of its high rate of recurrence, in parallel with the need for vigilance for extrahepatic recurrence within 20 months. Anatomic hepatectomy and adjuvant TACE are recommended to improve BDTT patient outcomes. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

189,Potential of novel colchicine dosage schedule for the palliative treatment of advanced hepatocellular carcinoma.,10.1002/kjm2.12374,"Previous in vitro and in vivo experiments had demonstrated dose-dependent anti-cancer effects of clinical plasma colchicine concentrations on hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells. This phase IIa trial was to evaluate the potential efficiency and safety of our novel colchicine dosage schedule for the palliative treatment of advanced HCC. The dosage schedule started from oral intake of 1 mg colchicine three times per day for 4 days and discontinuation in the following 3 days (one cycle). The treatment cycle was repeated and the dosage was adjusted ranging from 3 to 1.5 mg/day according to the condition of the participant. The control group was originated from chart review of 86 HCC patients treated by sorafenib for more than 2 months. Fifteen participants signed the inform consent. Two participants were excluded due to screening failure in one and less than four treatment cycles in another. For severe adverse events, the colchicine group demonstrated higher incidence of biliary tract obstruction (p = 0.0184) than the sorafenib group. Comparison grade 1 or 2 adverse events between two groups, the colchicine group had higher incidence of diarrhea (p = 0) and the sorafenib group had higher incidence of palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia syndrome (p = 0.0045). There was no significant difference in mortality, median survival, and overall survival between two groups (all p > 0.2).

190,"Platelet lysates in Hepatocellular Carcinoma patients after radiofrequency ablation facilitate tumor proliferation, invasion and vasculogenic mimicry.",10.7150/ijms.44405,"Background: Platelets play important roles in tumorigenesis, angiogenesis and metastatic dissemination of tumor cells. Radiofrequency ablation (RFA) could increase the circulating tumor cells in patients with primary or metastatic lung tumors. Whether platelet lysates in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) after RFA promote tumor progression has not been elaborated. Methods: HCC patients within Milan Criteria and without taking anti-platelet drugs were selected in the study. MTT assay, colony formation assay, transwell assay, tube formation and western blot were used to evaluate the effect of platelet lysates on HCC cells in vitro. Lung metastatic assay was performed in vivo. Results: Platelet lysates from patients after RFA promoted cell proliferation, colony formation, migration, invasion and vasculogenic mimicry in Hep3B and HCCLM3 cells compared with those from patients before RFA. Platelet lysates after RFA significantly increased the expression of p-Akt, p-Smad3 and snail, and decreased the expression of E-cadherin compared with those before RFA in Hep3B and HCCLM3 cells. Hep3B-Luc2-tdT cells incubation with platelet lysates from patients after RFA displayed enhanced lung metastasis compared with those before RFA.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: This single-center, two-arm, parallel-group, randomized controlled study was approved by the Institutional Review Board. Written informed consent was obtained from all patients upon enrollment. A total of 80 patients with 94 HCC nodules were randomized into either the DSM-RFA group or SSM-RFA group in a 1:1 ratio, using a blocked randomization method (block size 2). The primary endpoint was the minimum diameter of the ablation zone per unit time. The secondary endpoints included other technical parameters, complication rate, technique efficacy, and 2-year clinical outcomes. RESULTS: Significantly higher ablation energy per unit time was delivered to the DSM-RFA group than to the SSM-RFA group (1.7 ± 0.2 kcal/min vs. 1.2 ± 0.3 kcal/min; p < 0.001). However, no significant differences were observed between the two groups for the analyzed variables, including primary endpoint, regarding size of the ablation zone and ablation time. Major complication rates were 4.9% in the DSM-RFA group and 2.6% in the SSM-RFA group (p = 1.000). The 2-year local tumor progression (LTP) rates of the HCC nodules treated using DSM-RFA and SSM-RFA were 8.5% and 4.7%, respectively (p = 0.316).

Studies comparing both techniques are scarce. The aim of this study was to compare the efficacy of MWA versus RFA as a treatment for HCC. METHODS: Patients with HCC who were suitable for local ablation were randomized into MWA or RFA. All patients were followed up regularly with contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) performed at 1, 3, 6 and 12 months after ablation. Both patients and the radiologists who interpreted the post-procedure CT scans were blinded to the treatment allocation. Treatment-related morbidity, overall and disease-free survivals were analyzed. RESULTS: A total of 93 patients were recruited. Among them, 47 and 46 patients were randomized to MWA and RFA respectively. Patients in two groups were comparable in baseline demographics and tumor characteristics. With a median follow-up of around 30 months, there were no significant difference in the treatment-related morbidity, overall and disease-free survivals.

The study aimed to investigate the effects of preoperative interview and prospective nursing in patients with hepatic carcinoma undergoing transcatheter chemoembolization (TACE). Eighty-six patients with hepatocellular carcinoma who underwent TACE intervention treatment at our hospital between 2020 and 2023 were selected and randomly assigned to 2 groups using computerized randomization. The control group (n = 43) received routine nursing care, while the study group (n = 43) received preoperative interviews in combination with prospective nursing during the procedure. The patients' heart rate, mean arterial pressure, and blood pressure variations were recorded, along with their mood changes after intervention. The postoperative pain and satisfaction levels were compared between the 2 groups of patients, and the incidence of postoperative complications was observed. The heart rate, systolic blood pressure, and diastolic blood pressure of the 2 groups of patients were compared 1 day before the operation (P > .05).

METHODS: Patients with HBV-associated primary liver cancer who received transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) from March 2019 to March 2022 in the Interventional Therapy Department of our hospital were selected as the subjects, and the included 160 patients were randomly divided into modeling group (n = 120) and validation group (n = 40) in a ratio of 3 : 1. Visual analog scale (VAS) was used to assess pain severity. 120 patients in the modeling group were divided into no/mild abdominal pain group and severe abdominal pain group. The clinical data of the patients, including gender, age, TACE treatment history, vascular invasion, maximum diameter of tumor, infarction degree, preoperative Eastern Oncology Collaboration Group (ECOG) score, and Lipiodol dosage, were analyzed. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was used to evaluate the predictive value of the prediction model for severe abdominal pain post-TACE. RESULTS: A total of 116 patients (72.50%) had severe abdominal pain after TACE. Univariate analysis showed that severe abdominal pain after TACE in the modeling group was associated with TACE treatment history, maximum tumor diameter, infarction degree, and preoperative ECOG score (all P < 0.05), but not related to gender, age, vascular invasion, and Lipiodol dosage (all P > 0.05). Logistic regression analysis showed that TACE treatment history, maximum tumor diameter, infarction degree, and preoperative ECOG score were all independent influencing factors for acute abdominal pain post-TACE in HBV-HCC patients (all P < 0.05). The prediction model equation was Y = -3.673 + 1.722 × TACE treatment history + 1.175 × tumor maximum diameter + 2.064 × infarction degree + 1.555 × preoperative ECOG score. Goodness-of-fit test results showed no significant difference between the established prediction model and the observed value (χ (2) = 1.645, P = 0.560) and R (2) = 0.821, suggesting that the prediction ability of the model was relatively accurate. ROC analysis results showed that the area under the curve (AUC) of severe abdominal pain after TACE was 0.916 (0.862~0.970) and 0.902 (95% CI: 0.841~0.963) in the modeling group and the verification group, respectively.

However, lncRNA expression in the serum of HCC patients is still unclear. To identify candidate lncRNAs for HCC diagnosis, we purified exosomal total RNA from the serum of healthy volunteers (controls) and hepatitis, cirrhosis, and HCC patients. To assess the function of lncRNAs, small interfering RNAs and overexpression vectors were designed and cell viability and cell apoptosis assays conducted. The exosomes of the control group had a larger number of lncRNAs with a high amount of alternative splicing compared to hepatic disease patients. qPCR assays showed that lnc-FAM72D-3, lnc-GPR89B-15, lncZEB2-19, and lnc-EPC1-4 are differentially expressed in HCC. Furthermore, the expression level of lnc-EPC1-4 correlated with age. While the expression levels of lnc-GPR89B-15 and lnc-EPC1-4 correlated with serum alpha-fetoprotein level. lnc-FAM72D-3 knockdown decreased cell viability and promoted cell apoptosis, indicating that lnc-FAM72D-3 functions as an oncogene in HCC. In contrast, lnc-EPC1-4 overexpression inhibited cell proliferation and induced cell apoptosis, indicating that it functions as a tumor suppressor gene.

The present study aims to assess the risk for, primarily, intraoperative technical hepatic artery problems and, secondarily, postoperative hepatic artery complications encountered in patients who received TACE before liver transplantation. METHODS: Available data from HCC liver transplantation recipients across six European centres from January 2007 to December 2018 were analysed in a 1 : 1 propensity score-matched cohort (TACE versus no TACE). Incidences of intraoperative hepatic artery interventions and postoperative hepatic artery complications were compared. RESULTS: Data on postoperative hepatic artery complications were available in all 876 patients (425 patients with TACE and 451 patients without TACE). Fifty-eight (6.6 per cent) patients experienced postoperative hepatic artery complications. In total 253 patients who had undergone TACE could be matched to controls. In the matched cohort TACE was not associated with a composite of hepatic artery complications (OR 1.73, 95 per cent c.i. 0.82 to 3.63, P = 0.149). Data on intraoperative hepatic artery interventions were available in 825 patients (422 patients with TACE and 403 without TACE).

200,Clinical Outcomes of Radiological Treatment Modalities of Hepatocellular Carcinoma: A Single-Center Experience from Saudi Arabia.,,"BACKGROUND: Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the most common primary malignancy of the liver. Most patients with HCC are unsuitable for surgical therapies. Therefore, nonsurgical therapies play a central role in the management of this disease. Several percutaneous treatment modalities are available for HCC including radiofrequency ablation (RFA), transarterial chemoembolization (TACE), and transarterial radioembolization (TARE). In this study, we aim to evaluate the clinical outcomes, morbidity and mortality rates, and survival rates of four treatment modalities for HCC (RFA, TACE, TARE, and Sorafenib) and compare the success rate of each modality. METHODS: A retrospective observational study was conducted at King Abdulaziz Medical City in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia. The inclusion criteria were composed of patients diagnosed with HCC who received RFA, TACE, TARE, or Sorafenib treatments between 2008 and 2017. The primary outcome of this study was recurrence-free patients at the last follow-up. RESULTS: A total of 108 patients were included in this study. The mean age of the patients was 68.01 ± 9.98 years. Eighty-Two patients (75.9%) underwent interventions with the intention to cure or stabilize HCC, while twentysix patients (24.1%) were started on Sorafenib as a palliative treatment. The five years recurrence-free rates were 41.2% with RFA, 40% with the combination of TACE and RFA, 23.3% with TACE, and 0% with TARE. All patients on Sorafenib died from advanced-stage HCC. CONCLUSION: This study provides further evidence for the efficacy of several treatment modalities for the management of HCC. RFA and the combination of TACE and RFA showed better outcomes with a recurrence-free rate reaching up to 40%. TACE had a moderate survival benefit up to 23.3%.

One hundred and seventy patients were allocated randomly between December 2015 and December 2017, and 80 patients of each group were analysed. The modified response evaluation criteria in solid tumours (mRECIST) was used to evaluated the tumour response every 4-6 weeks. The primary endpoint was median progression-free survival (mPFS) and median overall survival (mOS). Safety was assessed by post-procedure complications. RESULTS: The study was completed in October 2018. Objective response rate (ORR) of the experimental group was 27.5% (22/80), mPFS and mOS was 5.8 and 8.1 months. ORR of the control group was 7.5% (6/80), mPFS and mOS was 2.9 and 4 months. The ORR were significantly different between two groups (χ(2) = 0.348, p<0.05). The differences of mPFS and mOS between the two groups were statistically significant (χ(2) = 2.865, p<0.05 and χ(2) = 0.926, p<0.05, respectively). There were no significant difference in post-procedure complications (p>0.05) and no major complications occurred. CONCLUSION: It is suggested that TACE with bleomycin is a safe and effective method for HCC and bleomycin can be a second-line chemotherapeutic agent for the HCC patients unresponsive to TACE with doxorubicin.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this prospective single-center observational study, 52 patients with HCC were recruited from January 2019 to December 2021, their clinical data and blood samples were collected, and the relationship between sCCL14 and progression-free survival (PFS) and TACE treatment response was analyzed. RESULTS: Among the 52 patients with HCC (Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer [BCLC] Stage A, 25.0%; BCLC Stage B, 44.2%; and BCLC Stage C, 30.8%), patients with BCLC Stage C HCC had significantly lower sCCL14 levels than those of patients with BCLC Stages A and B HCC (P = .001). sCCL14 levels were significantly higher in the first week after treatment than before TACE treatment (P = .024). Baseline sCCL14 levels in patients who showed complete response after TACE treatment were significantly higher than those in other groups, and lower baseline sCCL14 values were associated with shorter PFS times. Multivariate Cox regression analysis showed that sCCL14 level (hazard ratio, 1.855; 95% CI, 1.039-3.311; P = .037) was an independent prognostic factor of PFS. sCCL14 levels negatively correlated with the proportion of B lymphocytes and regulatory T cells in circulating blood and positively correlated with the absolute T-lymphocyte count.

METHODS: Sixty patients with gastroesophageal junction cancer and hepatic metastasis were randomly divided into two groups: group A (treatment group), which was treated with transarterial infusion chemotherapy plus microsphere embolization for gastroesophageal cancer, and with transarterial chemoembolization for hepatic metastasis; and group B (control group), which was treated with transarterial infusion chemotherapy for gastroesophageal cancer, and with transarterial chemoembolization for hepatic metastasis. The chemotherapy regimen used consisted of oxaliplatin plus FUDR. The embolization agent used for gastroesophageal cancer and the hepatic metastasis were Embosphere and ultra-liquefied lipiodol, respectively. RESULTS: The median survival time of patients in group A was 19 months, with survival rates at 12, 18, and 24 months of 93.3%, 60.0%, and 23.3%, respectively. The median survival time of patients in group B was 13 months, with survival rates at 12, 18, and 24 months of 60.0%, 30.0%, and 3.3%, respectively. There was a significant difference in survival between the two groups (P = 0.00). One month after treatment, the severity of dysphagia was significantly less in group A, as compared to that in group B (p < 0.001).

Eligible patients had unresectable BTC with 1 to 2 lines of prior therapy in the metastatic setting, measurable disease, and Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status less than or equal to 1. The primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS).RESULTSSeventy-seven patients were randomized and received study therapy. The trial met its primary endpoint, with a median PFS of 3.65 months in the combination arm versus 1.87 months in the monotherapy arm (HR 0.58, 90% CI 0.35-0.93, 1-tail P = 0.027). One patient in the combination arm (3.3%) and 1 patient in the monotherapy arm (2.8%) had a partial response. Combination therapy was associated with more rash, gastrointestinal events, CPK elevations, and thrombocytopenia. Exploratory analysis of tumor biopsies revealed enhanced expression of antigen processing and presentation genes and an increase in CD8/FoxP3 ratios with combination treatment.

Among MKIs, cabozantinib seems an ideal partner for ICIs, playing a potentially synergistic role via a spectrum of immunomodulatory actions. AREA COVERED: This paper discusses the preclinical rationale for combining cabozantinib and atezolizumab in advanced HCC. It examines the mechanism of action of these agents and highlights their synergistic activities in vitro. Other MKI plus ICI combinations under investigation are evaluated. The results of the phase 1b COSMIC-021 study testing cabozantinib plus atezolizumab across numerous tumor types are presented along with the study design and the recent results of the phase 3 COSMIC-312 trial evaluating this combination as a front-line option for advanced HCC. EXPERT OPINION: The eventual approval of novel combinations for advanced HCC will require careful patient selection and a refinement of study design for future trials. Regarding the search for predictive biomarkers, etiology and extent of disease may predict response to therapy. Moving cabozantinib to first-line, treatment sequencing should consider possible cross-resistance not only to ICIs but also to other MKIs. Finally, the response rates of such combinations may pave the way for their evaluation as peri-operative therapies.",Cammarota A; Zanuso V; D'Alessio A; Pressiani T; Personeni N; Rimassa L,False,"Does not fully match PICOS criteria due to lack of specified comparison group, outcomes, and study design.",patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma,cabozantinib plus atezolizumab,not specified,not specified,not specified,False,"Model A's decision is correct.

METHODS: The phase 1 study involved phase 1a monotherapy dose-escalation (part 1) and phase 1b combination therapy dose escalation (part 2) and expansion (part 3). Various dosing schedules of CS1002 (0.3, 1, or 3 mg/kg every 3 weeks, or 3 mg/kg every 9 weeks) were evaluated with 200 mg CS1003 every 3 weeks in part 3. RESULTS: Parts 1, 2, and 3 included a total of 13, 18, and 61 patients, respectively. No dose-limiting toxicities or maximum tolerated doses were observed. Treatment-related adverse events (TRAEs) were reported in 30.8%, 83.3%, and 75.0% of patients in parts 1, 2, and 3, respectively. Grade ≥3 TRAEs were experienced by 15.4%, 50.0%, and 18.3% of patients in each part. Of 61 patients evaluable for efficacy, 23 (37.7%) achieved objective responses in multiple tumor types. Higher objective response rates were observed with conventional and high-dose CS1002 regimens (1 mg/kg every 3 weeks or 3 mg/kg every 9 weeks) compared to low-dose CS1002 (0.3 mg/kg every 3 weeks) in microsatellite instability-high/mismatch repair-deficient tumors, melanoma, and hepatocellular carcinoma (50.0% vs. 58.8%, 14.3% vs. 42.9%, and 0% vs. 16.7%). CONCLUSION: CS1002, as monotherapy, and in combination with CS1003, had a manageable safety profile across a broad dosing range. Promising antitumor activities were observed in patients with immune oncology (IO)-naive and IO-refractory tumors across CS1002 dose levels when combined with CS1003, supporting further evaluation of this treatment combination for solid tumors. PLAIN LANGUAGE SUMMARY: CS1002 is a human immunoglobulin (Ig) G1 monoclonal antibody that blocks the interaction of CTLA-4 with its ligands and increases T-cell activation/proliferation. CS1003, now named nofazinlimab, is a humanized, recombinant IgG4 monoclonal antibody that blocks the interaction between human PD-1 and its ligands. In this original article, we determined the safety profile of CS1002 as monotherapy and in combination with CS1003. Furthermore, we explored the antitumor activity of the combination in anti-programmed cell death protein (ligand)-1 (PD-[L]1)-naive microsatellite instability-high/mismatch repair-deficient (MSI-H/dMMR) pan tumors, and anti-PD-(L)1-refractory melanoma and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). CS1002 in combination with CS1003 had manageable safety profile across a broad dosing range and showed promising antitumor activities across CS1002 dose levels when combined with CS1003.

207,Comparison of deep and moderate neuromuscular blockade in microwave ablation of liver tumours: a randomized-controlled clinical trial.,10.1038/s41598-021-81913-1,"Microwave ablation (MWA) is gaining popularity for the treatment of small primary hepatocellular carcinoma and metastatic lesions especially if patients are not candidates for surgical resection. Deep neuromuscular blockade (DMB) is perceived to improve surgical working conditions compared to moderate neuromuscular blockade (MMB) but no studies have examined the same benefits in MWA of liver tumours. This study aimed to compare the clinical outcomes of DMB and MMB in MWA of liver tumours in terms of liver excursion, performance scores by the interventional radiologists and patients, requirements of additional muscle relaxants and complications. 50 patients were recruited and 45 patients (22 in MMB group, 23 in DMB group) completed the study. The mean liver excursion for the MMB group (1.42 ± 1.83 mm) was significantly higher than the DMB group (0.26 ± 0.38 mm) (p = 0.001). The mean Leiden-Surgical Rating Scale (L-SRS) rated by the two interventional radiologists were 4.5 ± 0.59 and 3.6 ± 0.85 for the DMB and MMB groups, respectively (p = 0.01). There was also statistically significant difference on patient satisfaction scores (0-10: Extremely Dissatisfied-Extremely Satisfied) between DMB (8.74 ± 1.1) and MMB (7.86 ± 1.25) groups (p = 0.01). 5 patients from MMB group and none from DMB group required bolus relaxant during the MWA procedure.

In particular, doxorubicin has no defined optimal dosage in TACE procedures. We compared low versus currently used dose of doxorubicin for TACE in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in terms of severity of post-embolisation syndrome (PES) and overall survival (OS). METHODS: From October 2014 to March 2018, we enrolled patients with primary HCC scheduled for TACE. Patients were randomised to receive 50 mg (group A) or 100 mg (group B) of doxorubicin. Outcomes were the rate of patients with PES; free-time-to-PES; changes in laboratory results; tumour response at 1, 3, and 6 months after TACE; and overall survival. RESULTS: Twenty-eight patients (24 males, 4 females) were enrolled, aged 58.9 ± 6.8 years (mean ± standard deviation). Fifteen of them palliated with 50 mg (group A) and 13 with 100 mg (group B) of doxorubicin for a total of 68 TACE procedures (of 28 patients who had repeated TACE procedures). Visual analogue scale (VAS) and duration of pain were significantly differently lower in group A than in group B (p < 0.001). The median duration of fever was shorter in group A than in group B (p = 0.003). No significant differences between both groups were observed for tumour response to TACE and OS.

The aim is to establish a perfused liver administration dose that results in a tumoricidal dose of holmium-166 on the hyperaemic zone around the ablation necrosis (i.e. target volume). MATERIALS AND METHODS: This is a multicentre, prospective, dose-escalation study in HCC patients with a solitary lesion 2-5 cm, or a maximum of 3 lesions of ≤ 3 cm each. The day after RFA patients undergo angiography and cone-beam CT (CBCT) with (super)selective infusion of technetium-99 m labelled microalbumin aggregates ((99m)Tc-MAA). The perfused liver volume is segmented from the CBCT and (166)Ho-MS is administered to this treatment volume 5-10 days later. The dose of holmium-166 is escalated in a maximum of 3 patient cohorts (60 Gy, 90 Gy and 120 Gy) until the endpoint is reached. SPECT/CT is used to determine the biodistribution of holmium-166. The endpoint is met when a dose of ≥ 120 Gy has been reached on the target volume in 9/10 patients of a cohort. Secondary endpoints include toxicity, local recurrence, disease-free and overall survival. DISCUSSION: This study aims to find the optimal administration dose of adjuvant radioembolization with (166)Ho-MS after RFA.

In the recent decade, significant progress has been achieved in the systemic treatment of HCC, mainly from immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) and targeted therapy. In other malignancies, ICIs in the neoadjuvant setting have shown better outcomes than in the adjuvant setting. On the other hand, the addition of radiation to ICIs incrementally improves the systemic response to ICIs. Neoadjuvant therapy of ICIs plus stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) has shown promising results in several types of solid tumours but not HCC. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: Here, we describe a phase Ib clinical trial of neoadjuvant SBRT plus PD-1 (tislelizumab) prior to hepatic resection in HCC patients. Prior to resection, eligible HCC patients will receive 8 Gy×3 fractions of SBRT together with two cycles of tislelizumab with an interval of 3 weeks. HCC resection is scheduled 4 weeks after the second dose of tislelizumab, followed by adjuvant tislelizumab for 1 year. We plan to enrol 20 participants in this trial. The primary study endpoints include the delay of surgery, tumour response and safety and tolerability of the sequential SBRT/tislelizumab.

The ''Six-and-twelve score"" distinguishes three groups of ideal patients with different overall survival, based on the sum of the number and size of tumors. This may impact on clinical practice and trial design. The aim of this study was to assess the reproducibility and prognostic value of the model in western patients treated with Drug-Eluting Beads (DEB)-TACE. METHODS: Observational, retrospective, unicentric study with consecutive compensated patients treated with DEB-TACE from October 2008 to October 2017. Exclusion criteria were Child-Pugh ≥ 8 and DEB-TACE used as a bridge to liver transplantation. RESULTS: 225 HCC consecutive patients were included; BCLC-0/A n=131 (single nodules > 5, n=29) and BCLC-B n=94. The median overall survival (OS) was 27 months (95% CI 23.8-30.2).

212,Detection of hepatocellular carcinoma feeding vessels: MDCT angiography with 3D reconstruction versus digital subtraction angiography.,10.1186/s12880-024-01408-z,"BACKGROUND: Accurate detection of Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) feeding vessels during transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (TACE) is important for an effective treatment, while limiting non-target embolization. This study aimed to investigate the feasibility and accuracy of pre-TACE three dimensional (3D) CT angiography for tumor-feeding vessels detection compared to DSA. METHODS: Sixty-nine consecutive patients referred for TACE from May 2022 to May 2023 were included. (3D) CT images were reconstructed from the pre-TACE diagnostic multiphasic contrast enhanced CT images and compared with non-selective digital subtraction angiography (DSA) images obtained during TACE for detection of HCC feeding vessels. A ""Ground truth"" made by consensus between observers after reviewing all available pre-TACE CT images, and DSA and CBCT images during TACE to detect the true feeding vessels was the gold standard. Sensitivity, specificity, negative predictive value (NPV), positive predictive value (PPV), accuracy and ROC curve with AUC were calculated for each modality and compared. RESULTS: A total of 136 active HCCs were detected in the 69 consecutive patients included in the study. 185 feeding arteries were detected by 3D CT and DSA and included in the analysis. 3D CT detection of feeding arteries revealed mean sensitivity, specificity, PPV, NPV and accuracy of 91%, 71%, 98%, 36%, and 90%, respectively, with mean AUC = 0.81. DSA detection of feeding arteries revealed mean sensitivity, specificity, PPV, NPV, and accuracy of 80%, 58%, 96.5%, 16.5% and 78%, respectively, with mean AUC = 0.69.

213,Transradial versus transfemoral access without closure device for transarterial chemoembolization in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma: a randomized trial.,10.1007/s00330-022-09038-1,"OBJECTIVES: To compare patient satisfaction, procedural variables, and safety with transradial access (TRA) and transfemoral access (TFA) in patients undergoing transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). MATERIALS AND METHODS: From February 2019 to August 2021, 130 patients undergoing TACE for HCC were randomly allocated to the TRA (n = 65) or TFA (n = 65) group. Vascular closure devices were not used after TFA-TACE. All patients completed the post-catheterization questionnaire and 8-item Short-Form Health Survey 1 day after TACE. RESULTS: Technical success rate, crossover rate, contrast agent dose, fluoroscopy time, procedure time, air kerma, dose-area product, length of hospital stay, and total cost were similar between the two groups (all p > 0.05). The incidence and severity of adverse events were also similar between the two groups (all p > 0.05). However, overall discomfort, difficulty going to the bathroom, difficulty feeding or self-caring, difficulty walking, general health, physical function, role physical function, social function, mental health, and role emotional function were better in the TRA group than in the TFA group (all p < 0.001). Consequently, more patients preferred the current access for their next procedure in the TRA group than in the TFA group (90.8% vs. 24.6%; p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: In patients undergoing TACE for HCC, using TRA instead of TFA can improve patient satisfaction without compromising procedural variables and safety. KEY POINTS: • Transradial access (TRA) enabled early ambulation after transarterial chemoembolization (TACE), resulting in significant increase in activities of daily living and health-related quality of life (HRQoL) compared to transfemoral access (TFA) when vascular closure devices were not used. • Procedural variables (contrast agent dose, fluoroscopy time, procedure time, air kerma, dose-area product, length of hospital stay, and total cost) were not significantly different between patients who received TRA-TACE and TFA-TACE. • The incidence and severity of adverse events were similar between patients who received TRA-TACE and TFA-TACE.",Zhang X; Luo Y; Tsauo J; Zhao H; Gong T; Li J; Li Y; Zeng H; Sun W; Li X,False,"Intervention not immune checkpoint inhibitors, outcome not survival or response rate",patients undergoing TACE for HCC,transradial access (TRA),transfemoral access (TFA),"patient satisfaction, procedural variables, safety",randomized controlled trial,False,"Model A's decision is correct.

214,"Neutrophil-to-Lymphocyte Ratio and Early Tumor Shrinkage as Predictive Biomarkers in Unresectable Hepatocellular Carcinoma Patients Treated With Lenvatinib, PD-1 Inhibitors, in Combination With TACE.",10.1177/15330338231206704,"Purpose: The purpose of this prospective observational study was to investigate the relationship between pretreatment neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) and posttreatment early tumor shrinkage (ETS), and clinical outcomes in patients with unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (uHCC) who received lenvatinib, programmed death-1 inhibitors plus transcatheter arterial chemoembolization. Patients and Methods: A total of 63 uHCC patients were treated with this triple combination. Multivariate analyses to determine the independent factors associated with overall survival (OS) were employed. The link between NLR and clinical results was further analyzed. Furthermore, the predictive value of combining NLR with ETS should be investigated to stratify patients receiving treatment for survival benefits. Results: Progression-free survival and OS were 9.8 and 23.0 months, respectively, with a median follow-up of 20.8 months. On a multivariate analysis of OS, NLR was the only independent prognostic factor. Patients with NLR low (NLR < 3.2) had longer progression-free survival (19.3 vs 7.3 months, P < 0.001) and OS (28.9 vs 16.9 months, P < 0.001), higher objective response rate (86.7% vs 39.4%, P < 0.001), and a higher chance of achieving ETS ≥ 10% (ETS high) (73.3% vs 21.1%, P < 0.001) compared with patients with NLR high (NLR ≥ 3.2). The Spearman correlation analysis also showed the strong consistency between NLR and ETS (R(2) = 0.6751). In the subgroup analysis, greater OS benefit was found in the NLR low/ETS high group than the NLR high/ETS low group (χ(2) = 31.258, P < 0.001), while there was no survival difference for patients in the NLR low/ETS low group compared with in the NLR high/ETS high group (χ(2) = 0.046, P = 0.830).

METHODS: Patients between 20 and 80 years of age with 1-3 foci of HCC were selected. Included patients have had primary or recurrent liver lesions with no evidence of extra-hepatic metastasis prior to the study. Patients were treated with ultrasound-guided HIFU alone or HIFU combined with TACE (treated with TACE once within 4 weeks prior to receiving HIFU). RESULTS: Thirty-seven patients were enrolled, for a total of 45 lesions. The 2-year local control (LC) rate was 73.0% and the median LC time was 22 months. The 2-year progression-free survival (PFS) was 29.7% and the median PFS time was 9 months. Finally, the 2-year overall survival (OS) was 70.3%, and the median OS time was 24 months. The most common adverse events (AEs) were elevated liver enzymes, followed by fatigue, and pain, no grade 4 AEs or death occurred. Multivariate analysis showed that age, Child-Pugh class, and the number of tumors were independent prognostic factors for PFS and that the AFP levels and the number of tumors were significantly correlated with the OS. CONCLUSIONS: This study indicates that the HIFU/HIFU combined with TACE treatment is safe, and is capable of achieving both a good LC rate and a considerably good prognosis. The procedure should be considered for patients who were deemed unsuitable for other local treatments.

METHODS: In this prospective, randomized, single-center trial, patients were randomly assigned to receive TACE therapy with either lipiodol or DSM as the embolization agent. Therapy response was evaluated using MRI. Local tumor response was determined according to RECIST 1.1, and survival data was analyzed using the Kaplan-Meier estimator. RESULTS: Fifty patients (35 male, 15 female) were randomized and included in the survival analysis, whereas 31 patients completed therapy and were considered for evaluation of tumor responses (cTACE: n = 13, DSM-TACE: n = 18). In the cTACE group, PR was observed in 23%, SD in 15%, and PD in 62%. In the DSM-TACE-group, PR was observed in 22% of patients, SD in 56%, and PD in 22% (p = 0.047). In addition, the DSM-TACE group showed statistically significant tumor volume reduction (p = 0.006). Median apparent diffusion coefficient values were not significantly different between both groups at baseline (p = 0.26) and study endpoint (p = 0.83). Median survival in the cTACE group was 13 months (95% confidence interval, range 5-40 months) compared to 16 months (95% confidence interval, range 1-48 months) in the DSM-TACE group, exhibiting no statistically significant difference (p = 0.75). CONCLUSION: DSM-TACE showed a significant difference reducing tumor volume and in tumor response according to RECIST 1.1 compared to cTACE. Thus, patients with CRLM might not only benefit from short embolization effect of DSM-TACE but also from better tumor responses. Apparent diffusion coefficients were not significantly different between both groups and cannot be used as a biomarker for monitoring for therapeutic effect of TACE. KEY POINTS: • To our knowledge, this is the first prospective study that directly compared cTACE and DSM-TACE in patients with CRLM. • DSM-TACE showed a significant difference reducing tumor volume (p = 0.006) and in tumor response according to RECIST 1.1 (p = 0.047) compared to cTACE. • Survival analysis showed a median survival of 13 months in the cTACE group compared to 16 months in the DSM-TACE group (p = 0.75).",Vogl TJ; Marko C; Langenbach MC; Naguib NNN; Filmann N; Hammerstingl R; Gruber-Rouh T,False,"Population not hepatocellular carcinoma, outcome not survival or response rate",patients with CRLM,TACE with DSM or lipiodol,cTACE vs DSM-TACE,"tumor response, survival","prospective, randomized, single-center trial",False,"Model A's decision is correct.

HYPOTHESIS/OBJECTIVE: Objectives were to report outcomes, complications, and tumor responses via computed tomography (CT) assessment after drug-eluting bead transarterial chemoembolization (DEB-TACE) for nonresectable HC in dogs. The authors hypothesized that major complications would be uncommon and short-term CT assessment would demonstrate stable disease or partial response. ANIMALS: Client-owned dogs (n = 16) with nonresectable HC. METHODS: Prospective, single-arm clinical trial. Drug-eluting bead transarterial chemoembolization was performed to varying levels of blood flow stasis. Computed tomography imaging was compared before and approximately 12 weeks after initial treatment. RESULTS: Drug-eluting bead transarterial chemoembolization was successfully administered in all attempts. Based on percent change in elliptical tumor volume response (mL), stable disease (8/13; 62%) was the most common outcome followed by partial response (3/13; 23%) and progressive disease (2/13; 15%) with a median of 74 days (range, 39-125) after initial treatment. Median tumor volume (mL) after DEB-TACE decreased in volume by 13% (range, 56% decrease to 77% increase). Mild complications consistent with postembolization syndrome occurred after 7/27 (26%) treatments. Major complications occurred after 3/27 (11%) treatments: hepatic abscess/septicemia (2) and cholecystitis/death (1), resulting in treatment-induced death after 2/27 (7%) treatments. Median survival time after treatment was 337 days (range, 22-1061). Dogs with a presenting complaint of weight loss (P = .02) had a significantly shorter median survival time (126 days; range, 46-337) than those dogs without prior history of weight loss (582 days; range, 22-1061).

The purpose of this prospective study was to evaluate the long-term efficacy of SBRT for small (≤5 cm) HCCs. METHODS: A phase II, single-arm clinical trial on SBRT for small HCCs was conducted at an academic tertiary care center. The planned SBRT dose was 45 Gy with a fraction size of 15-Gy over 3 consecutive days. The primary endpoint was 2-year local control rate. Radiologic responses were assessed according to the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST, version 1.1) and the modified RECIST criteria. RESULTS: Between 2013 and 2016, 50 patients (53 lesions) were enrolled, with a median follow-up period of 47.8 months (range, 2.9-70.6). Patients' age ranged from 41 to 74 years, and 80% were male. Median tumor size was 1.3 cm (range, 0.7-3.1). The 2- and 5-year local control rates were 100% and 97.1%, respectively. The 5-year overall survival rate was 77.6%. Six months after SBRT, radiologic responses were evident in 44 lesions (83%) according to the RECIST criteria and 49 (92.4%) according to the modified RECIST criteria. None of the patients showed grade ≥3 adverse events. CONCLUSION: SBRT showed excellent results as an ablative treatment for patients with small HCCs while showing minimal toxicities.

Exploratory analyses characterized objective response rate (ORR), depth (DpR), and duration of response (DoR), and patients with a complete response (CR). METHODS: Patients were randomized 2:1 to intravenous ATEZO (1200 mg) + BEV (15 mg/kg) every 3 weeks or oral SOR (400 mg) twice daily. Tumors were evaluated using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors version 1.1 (RECIST 1.1) and HCC-modified RECIST (mRECIST). ORR by prior treatment and largest baseline liver lesion size, DoR, time to response (TTR), and complete response (TTCR) were analyzed. RESULTS: For both criteria, responses favored ATEZO/BEV versus SOR regardless of prior treatment and in patients with lesions ≥3 cm. Median TTR was 2.8 months per RECIST 1.1 (range: 1.2-12.3 months) and 2.8 months per mRECIST (range: 1.1-12.3 months) with ATEZO/BEV. Patients receiving ATEZO/BEV had a greater DpR, per both criteria, across baseline liver lesion sizes. Characteristics of complete responders were similar to those of the intent-to-treat population. In complete responders receiving ATEZO/BEV per mRECIST versus RECIST 1.1, respectively, median TTCR was shorter (5.5 vs. 7.0 months), mean baseline sum of lesion diameter was longer (5.0 [SD, 5.1] vs. 2.6 [SD, 1.4] cm), and mean largest liver lesion size was larger (4.8 [SD, 4.2] vs. 2.3 [SD, 1.0] cm).

Results revealed that initial, follow-up, or changes in unidimensional, bidimensional, or tridimensional tumor measurements were not associated with survival. Larger bidimensional and tridimensional tumor measurements/body weight on initial and follow-up CT were significantly associated with a shorter median survival time [bidimensional (P = 0.04, 0.016) and tridimensional (P = 0.025, 0.015), respectively]. A higher percent necrosis on initial CT was significantly associated with a shorter median survival time (P = 0.038). Ellipsoid volumetric criteria detected treatment response most frequently; however, response classification was not associated with median survival time.

METHODS: Patients with PLC who met the inclusion criteria were randomized into case group and control group. The case group was treated with FJXF combined with TACE. The control group was treated with TACE alone. The short-term clinical effect was evaluated; liver biochemistry, liver function index and multidrug resistance-associated indicators were detected. RESULTS: FJXF combined with TACE in the case group significantly increased the disease control rate than TACE alone in the control group (83.3% 61.1%). There was a reduction in the serum alpha-fetoprotein at 8 weeks after treatment in each group, while no difference between the two groups. The same trend can be observed for transaminase and direct bilirubin in both groups. In the case group, it showed a significant increase for albumin at 8 weeks after treatment, while no change in the control group.

223,Decision-Making Scoring System for the Repetition of Conventional Transarterial Chemoembolization in Patients With Inoperable Hepatocellular Carcinoma.,10.14309/ctg.0000000000000506,"INTRODUCTION: Patients with unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma treated with conventional transarterial chemoembolization (cTACE) have heterogeneous tumor burden and liver function. Therefore, the selection of patients for repeated cTACE is challenging owing to different outcomes. This study aimed to establish a decision-making scoring system for repeated cTACE to guide further treatment. METHODS: All patients with hepatocellular carcinoma who underwent cTACE between 2008 and 2019 were included and randomly assigned into training (n = 324) and validation (n = 162) cohorts. Tumor Size, number of Masses, Albumin-bilirubin score, baseline Alpha-fetoprotein level, and Response to initial cTACE session were selected to generate a ""SMAART"" score in the training cohort. Patients were stratified according to the SMAART score: low risk, 0-2; medium risk, 3-4; and high risk, 5-8. Prediction error curves based on the integrated Brier score and the Harrell C-index validated the SMAART scores and compared them with the Assessment for Retreatment with Transarterial chemoembolization (ART) score. RESULTS: The low-risk group had the longest median overall survival of 39.0 months, followed by the medium-risk and high-risk groups of 21.2 months and 10.5 months, respectively, with significant differences (P < 0.001). The validation cohort had similar results. The high-risk group had 63.1% TACE refractory cases. The Harrell C-indexes were 0.562 and 0.665 and the integrated Brier scores were 0.176 and 0.154 for ART and SMAART scores, respectively. DISCUSSION: The SMAART score can aid clinicians in selecting appropriate candidates for subsequent cTACE. A SMAART score of ≥5 after the first cTACE session identified patients with poor prognosis who may not benefit from additional cTACE sessions. behalf of The American College of Gastroenterology.",Bannangkoon K; Hongsakul K; Tubtawee T; Janjindamai P; Akkakrisee S; Piratvisuth T; Geater A,False,"Intervention does not involve immune checkpoint inhibitors, and study design is not a randomized controlled trial.",patients with hepatocellular carcinoma who underwent cTACE,repeated cTACE,not specified,median overall survival,retrospective study with random assignment into training and validation cohorts,False,"Model A's decision is correct.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 627 HCC patients with PVTT after initial treatment with one of the following at Affiliated Tumor Hospital of Guangxi Medical University: liver resection (LR, n = 225), transarterial chemoembolization (TACE, n = 298) or sorafenib (n = 104) were recruited and randomly divided into the training cohort (n = 314) and internal validation cohort (n = 313). Survival analysis were repeated after stratifying patients by Cheng PVTT type. RESULTS: Resection led to significantly higher OS than the other two treatments among patients with type I or II PVTT. TACE worked significantly better than the other two treatments for patients with type III. All three treatments were associated with similar OS among patients with type IV. These findings were supported by the internal validation cohort. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that the optimal treatment for HCC involving PVTT depends on the type of PVTT.

This study aimed to investigate the efficacy of Gamma knife radiosurgery (GKR) versus transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (TACE) in HCC patients with PVTT. METHODS: This retrospective study included 544 HCC patients with PVTT (GKR, 202; TACE, 342). Propensity score matching (PSM) analysis identified 171 matched pairs of patients. The primary endpoint was overall survival (OS). RESULTS: Before PSM, the GKR group exhibited longer median OS (mOS) than the TACE group (17.2 vs. 8.0 months, p < 0.001). We followed the Cheng's classification for PVTT. In the subgroup analysis, GKR was associated with significantly longer mOS for patients with PVTT II-IV (17.5 vs. 8.7 months, p < 0.001; 17.2 vs. 7.8 months, p = 0.001; 14.5 vs. 6.5 months, p = 0.001, respectively) and comparable OS for patients with PVTT I. After PSM, the GKR group had also a longer mOS than the TACE group (15.8 vs. 10.4 months, p < 0.001).

226,A study on prevention of bleeding complications using lusutrombopag for safe RFA in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma with low platelet counts: prospective observational study.,10.1186/s12876-023-02879-0,"BACKGROUND: Platelet (PLT) transfusion was the most practical way to increase patients' PLT counts before invasive hepatic procedures such as radiofrequency ablation (RFA) for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). A novel drug that raises the PLT count by acting on the thrombopoietin receptor has recently become available. METHODS: Lusutrombopag 3 mg was administered daily for 7 days to patients who underwent RFA for liver tumors with low PLT counts (< 50,000 PLT µL(- 1)). We collected demographic data concerning the patients' liver function and PLT counts. RESULTS: Lusutrombopag was administered to 91 patients, with a median age of 71 years (range 51-86). Forty-two patients had hepatitis C, 12 had hepatitis B, 21 had alcoholic liver disease, 11 had nonalcoholic steatohepatitis, and five had other diseases. The median Child-Pugh score was 7 (range 5-11). Thirty-seven patients had stage I tumors, 41 had Stage II, 12 had stage III, and one had stage IV. PLT count was elevated from 4.4 × 10(4) ± 1.4 × 10(4) to 8.6 × 10(4) ± 2.5 × 10(4) PLT µL(- 1). Lusutrombopag administration prevented PLT transfusions in 84/91 patients (92%). No patient had bleeding complications after RFA. One had portal thrombosis after lusutrombopag administration. Patients who achieved PLT counts of > 50,000 PLT µL(- 1) had higher PLT counts before lusutrombopag administration. The degree of splenomegaly did not affect the rate of PLT count elevation. There was no specific adverse effect by administrating lusutrombopag for patients with PLT counts of around 50,000 µL(- 1) but > 50,000 µL(- 1). CONCLUSIONS: Lusutrombopag administration before RFA was effective and seemed to be relatively safe for hepatocellular carcinoma patients with low PLT counts. TRIAL REGISTRATION: This study was approved by Japanese Red Cross Medical Center Institutional Reseach Comittie (#862, 07/03/2016), and was registered in a publically accessible primary register (#UMIN000046629, registered date: 14/01/2022).",Yoshida H; Ohki T; Kanezaki M; Teratani T; Sato S; Obi S; Sato T; Akamatsu M; Uchino K; Taniguchi H,False,"Intervention does not involve immune checkpoint inhibitors, and study design is not a randomized controlled trial.",HCC patients with low platelet counts,Lusutrombopag administration before RFA,not specified,PLT count elevation and prevention of PLT transfusions,not specified,False,"Model A's decision is correct.

The goal of this study is to compare the analgesic effect among celecoxib, parecoxib, and oxycodone in patients undergoing TACE. METHODS: This prospective study was a randomized, paralleled trial in which 213 patients were enrolled. Patients were assigned at the ratio of 1:1:1 to receive celecoxib, parecoxib, or controlled-release oxycodone 1 hour before TACE (T0) and once every 12 hours for 2 days after TACE. Pain scores, pain intensity, and adverse events in each time interval were evaluated and compared among the 3 groups. RESULTS: The mean pain score 12 hours after T0 in the parecoxib group (2.8) was lower than that in the celecoxib (4.4; P = .001) and oxycodone groups (4.2; P = .005). The number of patients suffering severe pain was 10 (14.7%) in the parecoxib, 25 (36.8%) in the celecoxib, and 23 (32.9%) in the oxycodone groups (P = .009). Twelve hours after T0, the incidence of grade 3 vomiting in the parecoxib group (2.9%) was significantly lower than that in the oxycodone group (17.1%; P = .006). In the multivariate analysis, nonparecoxib prophylactic analgesia (odds ratio [OR], 4.620; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.877-11.370; P = .001) as well as embolization of the gallbladder (OR, 8.666; 95% CI, 2.402-31.262; P = .001) and normal liver parenchyma (OR, 3.278; 95% CI, 1.409-7.627; P = .006) were the independent factors of severe pain intensity 12 hours after T0.

228,"Study protocol for locoregional precision treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma with transarterial chemoembolisation (TACTida), a clinical study: idarubicin dose selection, tissue response and survival.",10.1136/bmjopen-2022-065839,"INTRODUCTION: Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a common cause of cancer-related death, often detected in the intermediate stage. The standard of care for intermediate-stage HCC is transarterial chemoembolisation (TACE), where idarubicin (IDA) is a promising drug. Despite the fact that TACE has been used for several decades, treatment success is unpredictable. This clinical trial has been designed believing that further improvement might be achieved by increasing the understanding of interactions between local pharmacology, tumour targeting, HCC pathophysiology, metabolomics and molecular mechanisms of drug resistance. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: The study population of this single-centre clinical trial consists of adults with intermediate-stage HCC. Each tumour site will receive TACE with two different IDA doses, 10 and 15 mg, on separate occasions. Before and after each patient's first TACE blood samples, tissue and liquid biopsies, and positron emission tomography (PET)/MRI will be performed. Blood samples will be used for pharmacokinetics (PK) and liver function evaluation. Tissue biopsies will be used for histopathology analyses, and culturing of primary organoids of tumour and non-tumour tissue to measure cell viability, drug response, multiomics and gene expression. Multiomics analyses will also be performed on liquid biopsies. PET/MRI will be used to evaluate tumour viability and liver metabolism. The two doses of IDA will be compared regarding PK, antitumour effects and safety. Imaging, molecular biology and multiomics data will be used to identify HCC phenotypes and their relation to drug uptake and metabolism, treatment response and survival. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Participants give informed consent. Personal data are deidentified. A patient will be withdrawn from the study if considered medically necessary, or if it is the wish of the patient.

229,Hierarchically Positioning Laparoscopic Microwave Ablation in the Therapeutic Span of Early Hepatocellular Carcinoma: A Real-Life Comparative Analysis.,10.1245/s10434-024-16462-8,"BACKGROUND: Laparoscopic microwave ablation (LMWA) has yet to gain a specific place in treatment guidelines for early hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). This study compared the outcomes of LMWA and trans-arterial chemoembolization (TACE) for early non-resectable patients with HCC, taking percutaneous radiofrequency ablation (PRFA) as the reference treatment. METHODS: A retrospective multicenter observational study was conducted, enrolling non-transplantable, non-resectable patients who had early HCC treated with LMWA (n = 658) from Padua and Milan centers, and with PRFA (n = 844), and TACE (n = 425) from the ITA.LI.CA multicenter database. The matching-adjusted indirect comparison (MAIC) method was used to obtain weighted LMWA and TACE populations similar to the reference PRFA population. RESULTS: Laparoscopic ablation showed an excellent safety profile, and MAIC-weighted early postoperative deaths were comparable among the groups. The MAIC-weighted overall survival was similar between the LMWA (1-, 3-, and 5 year survival of 91.0 %, 67.9 %, 47.0 %, respectively) and PRFA (1-, 3- and 5 year survivals of 90.0 %, 64.7 %, 46.6 %, respectively) groups (p = 0.678) and significantly better for the LMWA group than for the TACE group (1-, 3- and 5 year survivals of 84.7 %, 48.8 %, 33.6 %, respectively) (p < 0.001). Weighted multivariate overall survival analysis and competing risk/subgroup analyses confirmed the non-inferiority of LMWA to PRFA and its superiority to TACE. The LMWA- and PRFA-treated patients had a significantly lower risk of HCC-related death (p = 0.004) than the TACE-treated patients (p = 0.001). Conversely, the groups did not differ significantly in terms of non-HCC-related deaths.

230,Predictive value of hepatic venous pressure gradient and efficacy and significance of early PTVE for gastrointestinal bleeding after TACE for liver cancer.,10.4103/jcrt.jcrt_331_22,"AIMS: To investigate the predictive value of hepatic venous pressure gradient (HVPG) and the efficacy and significance of early percutaneous transhepatic varices embolization (PTVE) for gastrointestinal bleeding after transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (TACE) for liver cancer. METHODS AND MATERIALS: This retrospective study enrolled 60 patients diagnosed with stage B or stage C liver cancer, according to the Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC) staging system, between December 2019 and October 2021. TACE and HVPG measurement (>16 mmHg or >20 mmHg) were performed on all 60 patients, who were randomized into control and experimental (PTVE) groups. All patients were followed up for 12 months. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS USED: SPSS 20.0 software was used for data analysis. The two groups were compared with respect to the initial occurrence time of hemorrhage after TACE, recurrence time of hemorrhage, liver function, TACE frequency, TACE type, and tumor control. RESULTS: The initial hemorrhage rates at one, three, six, and 12 months after TACE were 3.2%, 12.9%, 22.6%, and 48.4%, respectively, in the control group (n = 31) and 0%, 0%, 3.4%, and 10.3%, respectively, in the PTVE group (n = 29). Differences between the groups in terms of initial hemorrhage rate at six and 12 months postoperatively were significant (P < 0.05). The recurrence rates of hemorrhage at one, three, six, and 12 months after TACE were 11.1%, 22.2%, 22.2%, and 33.3%, respectively, in 27 patients in the control group. In eight patients in the PTVE group, the corresponding rates were 0%, 0%, 0%, and 25.0%. The differences between the groups in the recurrence rate of hemorrhage at the four time points were significant (P < 0.05). At six months postoperatively, liver function recovery and remission were noted in eight (25.8%) and 18 (66.7%) patients, respectively, in the control group; these events were noted in 10 (34.5%) and 19 patients (65.5%), respectively, in the PTVE group, and the difference between the groups was not significant (P > 0.05). In the control group, TACE was performed for a total of 94 times on 31 patients within 12 months, including conventional transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (C-TACE, 75.5%) and the drug-eluting bead TACE (DEB-TACE, 24.5%); the objective response rate (ORR) was 39.3%. In the PTVE group, TACE was performed for a total of 151 times on 29 patients within 12 months, with an average of 5.21 times on each patient, including the C-TACE (57.6%) and DEB-TACE (42.4%); the ORR was 60.1%. Differences in TACE frequency, proportion of C-TACE/DEB-TACE, and ORR were significant between the two groups (P < 0.05).

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Forty-three patients with HCC from 4 medical centers were enrolled in this multicenter prospective study. Of these, 41 patients were observed for 6 months following balloon-occluded alternate infusion transarterial chemoembolization. The primary endpoint was the safety of the procedure, and the secondary endpoint was the objective response rate (ORR) of the HCCs at 2 months following treatment. RESULTS: Three patients experienced adverse events, including 1 patient with facial swelling and skin rash, dissection of the celiac artery, and bland portal vein thrombus. No major adverse events were identified. Two (5.3%) patients regressed from a Child-Pugh classification of A to B.

232,Phase I/II study of PexaVec in combination with immune checkpoint inhibition in refractory metastatic colorectal cancer.,10.1136/jitc-2022-005640,"BACKGROUND: Oncolytic immunotherapy represents a unique therapeutic platform for the treatment of cancer. Here, we evaluated the safety and efficacy of the combination of pexastimogene devacirepvec (PexaVec) plus durvalumab (anti-programmed death ligand 1) with and without tremelimumab (anti-cytotoxic T-lymphocyte associated protein 4) in patients with standard chemotherapy refractory mismatch repair proficient (pMMR) metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) in a phase I/II trial. METHODS: Adult patients with histologically confirmed advanced pMMR mCRC, who had progressed on at least two prior lines of systemic chemotherapy were studied in four cohorts. Patients received four doses of PexaVec IV at a dose of 3×10(8) plaque forming units (pfu) (dose level 1) or 1×10(9) pfu (dose level 2) every 2 weeks. Twelve days after the first PexaVec administration, patients received either 1500 mg of durvalumab every 28 days alone or an additional single dose of 300 mg tremelimumab on day 1. Responses were assessed every 8 weeks by CT or MRI. AEs were recorded. The primary endpoints were safety and feasibility. Secondary endpoints included progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival. Paired tumor samples and peripheral blood were collected to perform immune monitoring. RESULTS: Thirty-four patients with mCRC enrolled on to the study: 16 patients in the PexaVec/durvalumab cohorts and 18 patients in the PexaVec/durvalumab/tremelimumab cohorts. Overall, the combination of PexaVec plus immune checkpoint inhibitors did not result in any unexpected toxicities. Most common toxicities observed were fever and chills after PexaVec infusion. Two cases of grade 3 colitis, one case of a grade 2 myositis and one case of grade 3 hypotension resulted in discontinuation of immune checkpoint inhibitor and PexaVec treatment, respectively. The median PFS in the PexaVec/durvalumab/tremelimumab cohorts was 2.3 months (95% CI: 2.2 to 3.2 months) vs 2.1 months (95% CI: 1.7 to 2.8 months; p=0.57) in the PexaVec/durvalumab cohorts. Flow cytometry analysis of peripheral blood mononuclear cells revealed an increase in Ki67(+)CD8(+) T cells on treatment. CONCLUSION: PexaVec in combination with durvalumab and tremelimumab is safe and tolerable. No unexpected toxicities were observed. The combination of PexaVec/durvalumab/tremelimumab demonstrated potential clinical activity in patients with pMMR mCRC, but further studies are needed to identify the predictive biomarkers.

METHODS: We conducted a three-center observational retrospective study of patients with advanced digestive tract cancer who received programmed death-1 (PD-1) inhibitors plus antiangiogenic agents between March 2019 and July 2022 in China. The patients had one of the three types of primary tumors: hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), colorectal cancer (CRC), and gastric cancer (GC). RESULTS: The study included 352 patients. The most frequently prescribed co-medications were nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) (46.3%), proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) (38.0%), systemic antibiotics (33.8%), and corticosteroids (30.1%). Probiotics had a direct correlation with a higher objective response rate (ORR) (OR 2.4, 95% CI 1.2 to 4.7, p = 0.013). Patients who received PPIs for gastritis/gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) (HR 0.7, 95% CI 0.5 to 1.0, p = 0.045), anticoagulants (HR 0.5, 95% CI 0.3 to 0.9, p = 0.009), and probiotics (HR 0.7, 95% CI 0.5 to 1.0, p = 0.034) had longer progression-free survival (PFS). Patients who received PPIs for gastritis/GERD (HR 0.6, 95% CI 0.4 to 0.9; p = 0.009) had longer overall survival (OS), while patients receiving opioids (HR 1.5, 95% CI 1.1 to 2.0, p = 0.010) had a significantly higher risk of death. CONCLUSION: Patients with advanced digestive tract cancer who were administered PPIs for gastritis/GERD indication, anticoagulants, or probiotics in combination with PD-1 inhibitors and antiangiogenic agents experienced improved clinical outcomes.

234,Clinical evaluation of in silico planning and real-time simulation of hepatic radiofrequency ablation (ClinicIMPPACT Trial).,10.1007/s00330-019-06411-5,"OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the accuracy and clinical integrability of a comprehensive simulation tool to plan and predict radiofrequency ablation (RFA) zones in liver tumors. METHODS: Forty-five patients with 51 malignant hepatic lesions of different origins were included in a prospective multicenter trial. Prior to CT-guided RFA, all patients underwent multiphase CT which included acquisitions for the assessment of liver perfusion. These data were used to generate a 3D model of the liver. The intra-procedural position of the RFA probe was determined by CT and semi-automatically registered to the 3D model. Size and shape of the simulated ablation zones were compared with those of the thermal ablation zones segmented in contrast-enhanced CT images 1 month after RFA; procedure time was compared with a historical control group. RESULTS: Simulated and segmented ablation zone volumes showed a significant correlation (ρ = 0.59, p < 0.0001) and no significant bias (Wilcoxon's Z = 0.68, p = 0.25). Representative measures of ablation zone comparison were as follows: average surface deviation (absolute average error, AAE) with 3.4 ± 1.7 mm, Dice similarity coefficient 0.62 ± 0.14, sensitivity 0.70 ± 0.21, and positive predictive value 0.66 ± 0. There was a moderate positive correlation between AAE and duration of the ablation (∆t; r = 0.37, p = 0.008). After adjustments for inter-individual differences in ∆t, liver perfusion, and prior transarterial chemoembolization procedures, ∆t was an independent predictor of AAE (ß = 0.03 mm/min, p = 0.01). Compared with a historical control group, the simulation added 3.5 ± 1.9 min to the procedure. CONCLUSION: The validated simulation tool showed acceptable speed and accuracy in predicting the size and shape of hepatic RFA ablation zones. Further randomized controlled trials are needed to evaluate to what extent this tool might improve patient outcomes. KEY POINTS: • More reliable, patient-specific intra-procedural estimation of the induced RFA ablation zones in the liver may lead to better planning of the safety margins around tumors. • Dedicated real-time simulation software to predict RFA-induced ablation zones in patients with liver malignancies has shown acceptable agreement with the follow-up results in a first prospective multicenter trial suggesting a randomized controlled clinical trial to evaluate potential outcome benefit for patients.",Moche M; Busse H; Futterer JJ; Hinestrosa CA; Seider D; Brandmaier P; Kolesnik M; Jenniskens S; Blanco Sequeiros R; Komar G; Pollari M; Eibisberger M; Portugaller HR; Voglreiter P; Flanagan R; Mariappan P; Reinhardt M,False,"Population is not specifically hepatocellular carcinoma, intervention is not ICIs, and study design is not a randomized controlled trial.",patients with malignant hepatic lesions,radiofrequency ablation,historical control group,accuracy and clinical integrability of a simulation tool,prospective multicenter trial,False,"Model A's decision is correct.

However, it often leads to a poor prognosis and decreased hepatic function especially in patients with BCLC substage B2. Lenvatinib (LEN) was demonstrated to be efficacious in these patients in the REFLECT phase 3 trial. We therefore aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of LEN as a first-line treatment for the patients with HCC at BCLC substage B2. METHODS: This prospective observational study used LEN in TACE-naïve patients with HCC at BCLC substage B2 and preserved hepatic function. The primary endpoint was overall survival. A one-year survival rate threshold of 60% and an expected survival rate of 78%, based on previous reports of TACE, was assumed for setting the sample size. With a one-sided α-type error of 5% and 70% detection power, 25 patients were required over a 2-year enrollment period and 10-month follow-up period. RESULTS: Thirty-one patients were enrolled in this study from June 2018 to June 2020. The 1-year survival rate was 71.0% (90% confidence interval, 68.4-73.6%). Median overall and progression-free survival periods were 17.0 and 10.4 months, and the objective response rates according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumor (RECIST) version 1.1 and modified RECIST criteria were 22.6% and 70.0%, respectively. Common adverse events (AEs) were fatigue (68%), hypertension (65%), anorexia (61%), palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia (39%), and thrombocytopenia (32%) of any grade; aspartate aminotransferase increased (23%), alanine aminotransferase increased (16%), and grade ≥ 3 proteinuria (13%). Treatment interruption and dose reduction were required in 61% and 81% of patients, respectively. LEN was discontinued in 29 patients due to disease progression (n = 17), AEs (n = 9), conversion to curative treatments (n = 2), and sudden death (n = 1), whereas post-LEN treatments were administered in 18 patients, including systemic chemotherapy (n = 11), TACE (n = 6), transarterial infusion (n = 1) and clinical trial (n = 1).

237,The clinical effects of ultrasound-guided microwave ablation in the treatment of primary hepatic carcinoma: Protocol for a retrospective clinical observation.,10.1097/MD.0000000000028045,"INSTRUCTION: Despite the continuous advancement of liver cancer diagnosis technology and level, there are still nearly two-thirds of patients with primary liver cancer that are already advanced at the time of diagnosis. Ultrasound-guided microwave ablation, as a palliative treatment for intermediate and advanced liver cancer, is currently recognized internationally Standard treatment for patients with unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma. However, recently, some scholars hold that ultrasound-guided microwave ablation does not guarantee complete inactivation of tumor lesions. METHODS/DESIGN: This study will evaluate the safety and effectiveness of ultrasound-guided microwave ablation in patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma through retrospective analysis. This study will follow a clinical research method with consecutive enrollment. The overall survival rate, objective tumor remission rate, serum indices and incidence of adverse effects after treatment will be counted for patients. DISCUSSION: At present, there are no good treatment options for intermediate and advanced hepatocellular carcinoma.

238,Single-center randomized trial comparing conventional chemoembolization versus doxorubicin-loaded polyethylene glycol microspheres for early- and intermediate-stage hepatocellular carcinoma.,10.1097/CEJ.0000000000000623,"According to Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer classification, transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) is preferred treatment for stage B and in certain cases for stage A hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Conventional TACE (c-TACE) and drug-eluting microspheres TACE (DEM-TACE) are available intraarterial therapies. Screening of patients with cirrhosis is of great importance for early detection of malignant liver nodules. Primary endpoint of this study was to compare DEM-TACE with c-TACE in terms of 12- and 24-month survival. Secondary endpoints were comparison of intensity and duration of the postembolization syndrome (PES) and severe adverse events. We randomized 60 patients with unresectable HCC one-to-one with c-TACE or DEM-TACE and followed them for at least 24 months or until death. TACE was repeated 'on-demand. Most patients underwent two TACE sessions and the median hospital stay was 3 days for c-TACE and 2 days for DEM-TACE group. The overall 12- and 24-month survival rates were 89.8 and 70.7%, respectively, precisely 85.7 and 63.6% after c-TACE and 90.2 and 75.8% after DEM-TACE, without any significant difference (P = 0.18). Median overall survival was 21.1 months. Significant difference in the overall 12- and 24-month survival was found in patients with Child-Pugh A compared to Child-Pugh B class (P = 0.001). Child-Pugh class, aspartate aminotransferase levels and ascites independently predicted survival (P = 0.003). Both, DEM-TACE and c-TACE showed excellent 12- and 24-month survival rates.

240,A Pilot Trial Evaluating Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy to Induce Hyperemia in Combination With Transarterial Chemoembolization for Hepatocellular Carcinoma.,10.1016/j.ijrobp.2020.07.033,"PURPOSE: Despite the survival benefit of transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) for unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), a majority of tumors recur, attributed to hypovascularity and treatment resistance. Preclinical studies show that moderate radiation doses induce changes in tumor permeability and perfusion, suggesting an opportunity for TACE sensitization by radiation. In this prospective phase 1 trial, we evaluated the feasibility, safety, tolerability, response, and functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) changes associated with single-fraction stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) followed by TACE within 24 hours. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Patients with HCC, 1 to 3 lesions, Childs-Pugh A/B liver function, and no major vascular invasion were enrolled. The primary objective was to establish the feasibility of single-dose SBRT (7.5 or 10 Gy) followed by TACE within 24 hours. Secondary endpoints included safety, tolerability, perfusional changes via functional MRI, overall response rate (ORR), clinical benefit rate (CBR), freedom from local progression, progression-free survival, and overall survival. RESULTS: Sixteen patients were enrolled, and 13 received SBRT and TACE. Median follow-up was 15.3 months. Best overall ORR and CBR were 76.9% and 92.3%, respectively. The 1- and 3-month ORR was 76.9% and 69.2%, respectively, and 1- and 3-month CBR was 92.3% and 69.2%, respectively. Median overall survival, progression-free survival, and freedom from local progression were 14.0, 5.2, and 5.9 months, respectively. Crude rates of grade 1+ and grade 2+ toxicity were 85% and 38%, respectively. No grade 3 to 4 toxicities were recorded. One grade 5 toxicity occurred due to hemorrhage 4 days after TACE. On dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI, the transfer rate constant from blood plasma to extracellular extravascular space (k(pe)) increased within 6 hours post-SBRT but decreased by 24 hours. CONCLUSIONS: We hypothesized a strategy of SBRT preceding TACE for the purpose of enhancing TACE delivery and efficacy and tested this strategy in a small pilot study. We found that single-dose SBRT followed by TACE within 24 hours is feasible and tolerable. Dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI revealed acute changes in tumor permeability/perfusion after SBRT.

However, their broad adoption requires ease of use and demonstration of real-world clinical utility/impact. ORIGAMA (MO42720) is an interventional, open-label, multicountry platform study investigating the clinical utility of DPM tools and specific treatments. ORIGAMA will begin with two cohorts that aim to assess the impact of the atezolizumab-specific Roche DPM Module (hosted on the Kaiku Health DPM platform (Helsinki, Finland)) on health outcomes and healthcare resource usage, and its feasibility to support at-home treatment administration, in participants receiving systemic anticancer treatment. Other digital health solutions may be added to future cohorts. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: In Cohort A, participants with metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), extensive-stage SCLC or Child Pugh A unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma will be randomised to a locally approved anticancer regimen containing intravenous atezolizumab (TECENTRIQ, F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd/Genentech) and local standard-of-care support, with/without the Roche DPM Module. Cohort B will assess the feasibility of the Roche DPM Module in supporting administration of three cycles of subcutaneous atezolizumab (1875 mg; Day 1 of each 21-day cycle) in the hospital, followed by 13 cycles at home by a healthcare professional (ie, flexible care), in participants with programmed cell-death ligand 1-positive, early-stage NSCLC. The primary endpoints are the mean difference in change of the participant-reported Total Symptom Interference Score at Week 12 from baseline (Cohort A) and flexible care adoption rate at Cycle 6 (Cohort B).

242,Construction of a novel disulfidptosis-related signature for improving outcomes in hepatocellular carcinoma: Observational study.,10.1097/MD.0000000000035423,"Disulfidptosis is a novel form of metabolic-related regulated cell death (RCD) that is caused by disulfide stress caused by the accumulation of excess cystine in the cell. Targeting disulfide metabolism imbalance is an emerging strategy for the treatment of cancer. However, it is undetermined how disulfidptosis-related genes (DRGs) influence hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Unsupervised clustering analysis was performed on the TCGA-LIHC cohort to identify various phenotypes of disulfidptosis. GSVA was used to measure the activation of characteristic gene sets, while CIBERSORT was employed to estimate the infiltration of immune cells. Disulfidptosis-related signature was generated to quantify the phenotype of disulfidptosis in HCC patients. Next, we examined the disparities among the high and low disulfidptosis score categories by considering clinical characteristics, infiltration of immune cells, functions related to the immune system, sensitivity to chemotherapeutic drugs, and effectiveness of immunotherapy. Two different disulfidptosis phenotypes with different prognoses, clinical traits, biological pathways, and immune cell infiltration were identified. Based on differently expressed genes (DEGs) among 2 disulfidptosis phenotypes, a disulfidptosis-related signature was built. The prognostic value of this signature was then evaluated in the TCGA and GEO datasets. Low disulfidptosis score indicated favorable clinical outcomes, higher levels of immune cell infiltration, lower tumor purity, and enhanced immune responses. Furthermore, we noticed a clear disparity in tumor mutation load and drug responsiveness when comparing the high and low disulfidptosis score categories. Finally, a quantitative nomogram was built with disulfidptosis score and several clinical characteristics. The disulfidptosis-related signature provides new insights into the tumor immune microenvironment and complexity in HCC. The disulfidptosis score can serve as a promising tool for personalized prognostic prediction of HCC patients and for customizing more effective immunotherapeutic strategies.",Chen X; Liang Q; Zhou Y,False,"No specific intervention or comparison group mentioned, and outcomes do not directly relate to survival or response rate.",HCC patients,not specified,not specified,"prognostic prediction, immunotherapeutic strategies",not specified,False,"Model A's analysis is correct.

METHODS: This was a single centre phase 1 trial to assess the safety and tolerability of PACOX. All the enrolled subjects received treatment in 3-weekly cycles: intravenous PEG-BCT-100 2.7 mg/kg on days 1, 8 and 15 of each cycle; oral capecitabine 1000 mg/m(2) twice daily on day 1-14 of each cycle and intravenous oxaliplatin on day 1. Three dose levels of oxaliplatin (85 mg/m(2), 100 mg/m(2) or 130 mg/m(2)) were studied to define the maximum tolerated dose (MTD). Adverse events (AEs), efficacy by RECIST v1.1, time to progression (TTP), progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) were studied. RESULTS: Seventeen patients were enrolled at 3 dose levels of oxaliplatin: 85 mg/m(2) (8 patients), 100 mg/m(2) (3 patients), and 130 mg/m(2) (6 patients). The median age was 55 years; all had had locoregional chemotherapy or targeted therapy such as sorafenib, but no systemic chemotherapy. The most common AEs were nausea (82%), injection site reaction (76%), palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia (59%), oral mucositis (53%) and vomiting (53%). There was no dose-limiting toxicity (DLT). Median duration on study was 8 weeks overall. In 14 evaluable cases, one achieved partial response (PR), 4 had stable disease (SD); disease control rate was 36%; most responses were observed in the 130 mg/m(2) cohort with 1 PR and 2 SDs. Median TTP and PFS were both 7.0 weeks. Overall median OS was 10.7 months; the median OS was not reached at 19.4 months of follow-up in the 130 mg/m2 cohort.

However, the treatment outcomes for patients with portal vein tumor thrombosis (PVTT) remain poor. In this study, we evaluate the efficacy of SBRT with and or without sorafenib for advanced HCC with PVTT.Fifty four HCC patients with PVTT treated with SBRT using the Cyberknife system was retrospectively analyzed between January 2009 and June 2016. Of these, sorafenib combined with SBRT was administered to 18 patients and SBRT alone was administered to 36 patients. SBRT was designed to target the liver tumor and tumor thrombosis, with a radiation dose of 36 to 45 Gy (median 40 Gy) given in 3 to 5 fractions.The mean follow-up period for SBRT with sorafenib and SBRT alone was 13.22 ± 10.07 months and 15.33 ± 22.01 months, respectively. The response rate was comparable in both groups. Complete response and partial response rates were 77.77% for SBRT with sorafenib and 75.00% without sorafenib (P = .43). The median progression-free survival rate was 6 months (2-11 months) versus 3 months (2-5.6 months) (P = .24) and the 1- and 2-year progression-free survival rates were 25.7% and 15.2% versus 11.1% and 8.3% (P = .1225).

This phase I/II study (NCT03637764) assessed the safety and activity of isatuximab plus atezolizumab (Isa + Atezo), an anti-programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) antibody, in patients with immunotherapy-naive solid tumors: epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC), glioblastoma (GBM), hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), and squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (SCCHN). PATIENTS AND METHODS: Phase I assessed safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and the recommended phase II dose (RP2D) of isatuximab 10 mg/kg intravenously (i.v.) every week for 3 weeks followed by once every 3 weeks + atezolizumab 1200 mg i.v. every 3 weeks. Phase II used a Simon's two-stage design to assess the overall response rate or progression-free survival rate at 6 months (GBM cohort). Interim analysis was carried out at 6 months following first dose of the last enrolled patient in each cohort. Pharmacodynamic biomarkers were tested for CD38, PD-L1, tumor-infiltrating immune cells, and FOXP3+ regulatory T cells (Tregs) in the tumor microenvironment (TME).

246,Efficacy of Invariant Natural Killer T Cell Infusion Plus Transarterial Embolization vs Transarterial Embolization Alone for Hepatocellular Carcinoma Patients: A Phase 2 Randomized Clinical Trial.,10.2147/JHC.S416933,"PURPOSE: Invariant NKT cells (iNKT) are CD1d-restricted T cells with the capacity of antitumor immunity. The safety of autologous iNKT cell treatment in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) has been verified. This study aimed to investigate its efficacy in advanced HCC after transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) failure. PATIENTS AND METHODS: This open-label, randomized, controlled, trial enrolled 60 patients with unresectable HCC after TACE failure at three centers. Transarterial embolization (TAE) was used instead of TACE to protect iNKT cell function. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive TAE therapy with (TAE-iNKT) or without (TAE) biweekly iNKT cell infusion. The primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS). Secondary endpoints included overall survival (OS), objective response rate (ORR), disease control rate (DCR), quality of life (QoL), peripheral blood cell count, and safety. RESULTS: Fifty-four patients completed the study. Median PFS was significantly higher in TAE-iNKT patients (5.7 months [95% CI, 4.3-7.0 months]) compared with TAE patients (2.7 months [95% CI, 2.3-3.2 months]; hazard ratio 0.32 [95% CI, 0.16-0.63]; P<0.001). Higher ORR and DCR were observed in TAE-iNKT patients (52% and 85%, respectively) compared with TAE patients (11% and 33%; respectively). Five TAE-iNKT patients and 1 TAE patient achieved completed response. The median time to deterioration in QoL was longer in TAE-iNKT patients (9.2 months [95% CI, 6.0-13.3 months]) compared with TAE patients (3.0 months [95% CI, 2.9-3.0 months]). The mean lymphocytes were higher in the TAE-iNKT group than in the TAE group at 8 (1.48 vs 0.95×10(9)/L, P = 0.007) and 12 (1.49 vs 0.89×10(9)/L, P = 0.001) weeks. Grade 3 adverse events occurred in 1 TAE-iNKT patient (4%) and 5 TAE patients (19%). All the other adverse events were grade 1-2.

247,Purification of HCC-specific extracellular vesicles on nanosubstrates for early HCC detection by digital scoring.,10.1038/s41467-020-18311-0,"We report a covalent chemistry-based hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC)-specific extracellular vesicle (EV) purification system for early detection of HCC by performing digital scoring on the purified EVs. Earlier detection of HCC creates more opportunities for curative therapeutic interventions. EVs are present in circulation at relatively early stages of disease, providing potential opportunities for HCC early detection. We develop an HCC EV purification system (i.e., EV Click Chips) by synergistically integrating covalent chemistry-mediated EV capture/release, multimarker antibody cocktails, nanostructured substrates, and microfluidic chaotic mixers.

248,Validation of the six-and-twelve criteria among patients with hepatocellular carcinoma and performance score 1 receiving transarterial chemoembolization.,10.3748/wjg.v26.i15.1805,"BACKGROUND: Transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) is recommended for patients with intermediate hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) according to treatment guidelines. However, a large number of patients with advanced HCC also receive TACE in clinical practice, especially for those with liver-confined HCC and Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group score (ECOG) 1. In view of previous studies, such patients have different prognoses from advanced HCC patients with macrovascular invasion or extrahepatic spread; therefore, patients with ECOG 1 alone might be classified into the intermediate stage and benefit from TACE treatment, but a study particularly focusing on such patients and exploring the effectiveness of TACE therapy is lacking. AIM: To investigate treatment outcomes of TACE in HCC patients with ECOG 1 alone and propose a specific prognostic model. METHODS: Patients from 24 Chinese tertiary hospitals were selected in this nationwide multicenter observational study from January 2010 to May 2016. Overall survival (OS) was estimated using Kaplan-Meier curves and compared by the log-rank test. Multivariate Cox regression was used to develop the potential prognostic models. The discriminatory ability of the models was compared and validated in various patient subgroups. The individual survival prediction for six-and-twelve (6&12) criteria, defined as the algebraic sum of tumor size (cm) and tumor number, was illustrated by contour plot of 3-year survival probability and nomogram. RESULTS: A total of 792 eligible patients were included. During follow-up, median OS reached 18.9 mo [95% confidence interval (CI): 16.9-21.0]. Three independent multivariate analyses demonstrated that tumor size, tumor number, α-fetoprotein level, albumin-bilirubin grade and total bilirubin were prognostic factors of OS (P < 0.05). The previously proposed 6&12 criteria was comparable or even better than currently proposed with the highest predictive ability. In addition, the 6&12 criteria was correlated with OS in various subgroups of patients. The patients were stratified into three strata with score ≤ 6, > 6 but ≤ 12, and > 12 with different median OS of 39.8 mo (95%CI: 23.9-55.7), 21.1 mo (95%CI: 18.4-23.8) and 9.8 mo (95%CI: 8.3-11.3), respectively (P < 0.001). CONCLUSION: TACE is effective for advanced HCC patients with ECOG 1 alone, and the 6&12 criteria may help with clinical decision-making. reserved.",Wang ZX; Li J; Wang EX; Xia DD; Bai W; Wang QH; Yuan J; Li XM; Niu J; Yin ZX; Xia JL; Fan DM; Han GH,False,"Population and intervention match, but no comparison group specified and study design is not a randomized controlled trial.",advanced HCC patients with ECOG 1,TACE,not specified,overall survival,nationwide multicenter observational study,False,Model A's analysis is correct.

Through the tumor-free survival (TFS) and overall survival (OS) rates analyses of serum AFP and sICAM-1 levels in 87 patients with primary hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), the patients whose AFP and sICAM-1 levels were normal (AFP < 20 μg/L or sICAM-1 < 1000 μg/L) before surgery or recovered to normal after surgery exhibited a lower tumor recurrence rate and better OS than patients with elevated serum levels of the two markers. Combined analysis showed that patients with synchronously elevated levels of AFP and sICAM-1 showed the lowest TFS and OS. In addition, the RNA-seq data and clinical information of The Cancer Genome Atlas Liver Hepatocellular Carcinoma were collected to analyze the predictive values of AFP and ICAM-1 in the diagnosis, prognosis and immunotherapy of HCC. The results indicated that the combined application of the two indicators had higher accuracy in both the diagnosis and prognostic prediction of HCC by receiver operating characteristic curves. AFP and ICAM-1 were significantly correlated with multiple immune cells in HCC samples but not in normal samples. The patients with low expression of the two indicators were most likely to benefit from the immune checkpoint blockade therapy.

We aimed to develop a prognostic score model for predicting different prognoses of patients with HCC and portal vein invasion who received sorafenib plus TACE. METHODS: This observational study included 167 patients with HCC and portal vein invasion undergoing sorafenib combined with TACE from January 2013 to June 2018 at two hospitals. Multivariate Cox regression analysis was performed using a training cohort (n = 83) to identify critical factors associated with survival. Then, a prognostic score model was established to classify different outcomes and confirmed using a validation cohort (n = 84). RESULTS: Three factors were determined to critically impact survival in the training cohort: portal vein invasion extent, sorafenib-related dermatologic response, and initial radiological response. Using the β-coefficients of these factors, a prognostic score was calculated, and the survival time decreased as the score increased. Based on the prognostic score model, three different prognoses of patients with 0 points, 2-3 points, and > 3 points were stratified with a median survival of 38.0 months, 20.0 months, and 7.0 months, respectively (P < 0.001).

METHODS: A total of 132 patients with PLC admitted to our hospital were selected for the study, among whom 68 patients received TACE combined with HIUF and were assigned to the observation group (OG), whereas the remaining 54 patients were treated with TACE alone and were assigned to the control group (CG). The factors influencing the patients' prognosis were also evaluated by multivariate analysis. RESULTS: The total effective rate of the OG was 83.82%, which was significantly higher than that of 55.56% of the CG (P < .05). No significant difference was found in incidence of adverse reactions between the two groups (P > .05).

METHODS: This study is designed as a mono-center study. The participants are randomized into three group, and received the following recommended schedule: 49Gy/7f, 54Gy/6f and 55Gy/5f with BED(10) in correspondence to 83.3Gy, 102.6Gy and 115.5Gy. The primary outcome measures are to calculate local control rates (LC), overall survival rates (OS) and progression-free survival rates (PFS).

255,Enlarged extracellular vesicles are a negative prognostic factor in patients undergoing TACE for primary or secondary liver cancer-a case series.,10.1371/journal.pone.0255983,"BACKGROUND: Transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) has evolved as a standard treatment option in patients with intermediate stage, unresectable HCC [Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC) stage B] as well as in patients with liver metastases, when surgery or systemic therapy is considered not appropriate. Concentration and sizes of extracellular vesicles (EVs) recently emerged as novel diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers in patients with liver cancer, but no data on its prognostic relevance in the context of TACE exists. Here, we evaluate pre-interventional EVs as a potential biomarker in patients undergoing TACE for primary and secondary hepatic malignancies. METHODS: Vesicle size distribution and concentration were measured by nanoparticle tracking analysis (NTA) in patient sera before and after TACE in 38 patients. RESULTS: Extracellular vesicle size distribution measured before TACE is of prognostic significance with respect to overall survival in patients after TACE. Overall survival is significantly reduced when initial vesicle size (X50) is in the upper quartile (>145.65nm). Median overall survival in patients in the upper quartile was only 314 days, compared to 799 days in patients with vesicle size in the first to third quartile (<145.65nm; p = 0.007). Vesicle size was also shown to be a significant prognostic marker for overall survival in Cox regression analysis [HR 1.089, 95% CI: 1.021-1.162, p = 0.010]. In addition, a significant correlation was observed between initial EVs concentration/BMI (rS = 0.358, p = 0.029), X50/IL-8-concentration (rS = 0.409, p = 0.011) and X50/CRP-concentration (rS = 0.404, p = 0.016). In contrast, with regard to immediate tumor response after TACE, EVs concentration and size did not differ.

We also tracked GPC3 immunohistochemical (IHC) staining, CTL induction, and postoperative plasma GPC3 for a patient group that was administered the vaccine (n = 35) and an unvaccinated patient group that underwent surgery only (n = 33). The 1-y recurrence rate after surgery was reduced by approximately 15%, and the 5-y and 8-y survival rates were improved by approximately 10% and 30%, respectively, in the vaccinated group compared with the unvaccinated group. Patients who were positive for GPC3 IHC staining were more likely to have induced CTLs, and 60% survived beyond 5 y. Vaccine efficacy had a positive relationship with plasma concentration of GPC3; high concentrations increased the 5-y survival rate to 75%.

We assessed the combination of camrelizumab with apatinib in pretreated advanced primary liver cancer (PLC, cohort A) from a multicohort phase Ib/II trial. METHODS: Patients with PLC after prior systemic treatment(s) were administered camrelizumab (3 mg/kg, once every 2 weeks) plus apatinib (125, 250, 375, or 500 mg; once per day) in a 3+3 dose-escalation stage and subsequent expansion stage. The primary endpoints were tolerability and safety of study treatment. RESULTS: From April 2017 to July 2019, 28 patients (21 with hepatocellular carcinoma and 7 with intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma) received camrelizumab plus apatinib. Two dose-limiting toxicities (both grade 3 diarrhea) were reported in the 500 mg cohort. Therefore, the 375 mg cohort was expanded. Of the 19 patients in the 375 mg cohort, dose reduction to 250 mg occurred in 8 patients within 2 months after treatment initiation. Of the 28 patients with PLC, 26 had grade ≥3 treatment-related adverse events, with hypertension being the most common (9/28). One treatment-related death occurred. The objective response rate was 10.7% (95% CI 2.3% to 28.2%). Median progression-free survival and overall survival were 3.7 months (95% CI 2.0 to 5.8) and 13.2 months (95% CI 8.9 to not reached), respectively. CONCLUSION: The combination of camrelizumab with apatinib had a manageable toxicity and promising antitumor activity in patients with advanced PLC.

RESULTS: The 3-month complete response (CR), overall response rate (ORR), and the 6-month CR, ORR, as well as the disease control rate (DCR) were increased in CBATO group compared with the cTACE group. Also, the TACE with CBATO was an independent predicting factor for lower stable disease+ progressive disease (non-ORR). Besides, PFS and OS were longer in CBATO group compared with cTACE group. Referring to biochemical indexes (including liver function indexes, kidney function indexes, and blood routine indexes), no difference between the two groups was found. As for adverse events, the prevalence of nausea and vomiting was decreased, while the prevalence of other adverse events were similar in CBATO group compared to cTACE group.

263,Evaluation of two different transarterial chemoembolization protocols using Lipiodol and degradable starch microspheres in therapy of hepatocellular carcinoma: a prospective trial.,10.1007/s12072-021-10193-8,"BACKGROUND: This prospective randomized trial is designed to compare the performance of conventional transarterial chemoembolization (cTACE) using Lipiodol-only with additional use of degradable starch microspheres (DSM) for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in BCLC-stage-B based on metric tumor response. METHODS: Sixty-one patients (44 men; 17 women; range 44-85) with HCC were evaluated in this IRB-approved HIPPA compliant study. The treatment protocol included three TACE-sessions in 4-week intervals, in all cases with Mitomycin C as a chemotherapeutic agent. Multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was performed prior to the first and 4 weeks after the last TACE. Two treatment groups were determined using a randomization sheet: In 30 patients, TACE was performed using Lipiodol only (group 1). In 31 cases Lipiodol was combined with DSMs (group 2). Response according to tumor volume, diameter, mRECIST criteria, and the development of necrotic areas were analyzed and compared using the Mann-Whitney-U, Kruskal-Wallis-H-test, and Spearman-Rho. Survival data were analyzed using the Kaplan-Meier estimator. RESULTS: A mean overall tumor volume reduction of 21.45% (± 62.34%) was observed with an average tumor volume reduction of 19.95% in group 1 vs. 22.95% in group 2 (p = 0.653). Mean diameter reduction was measured with 6.26% (± 34.75%), for group 1 with 11.86% vs. 4.06% in group 2 (p = 0.678). Regarding mRECIST criteria, group 1 versus group 2 showed complete response in 0 versus 3 cases, partial response in 2 versus 7 cases, stable disease in 21 versus 17 cases, and progressive disease in 3 versus 1 cases (p = 0.010). Estimated overall survival was in mean 33.4 months (95% CI 25.5-41.4) for cTACE with Lipiosol plus DSM, and 32.5 months (95% CI 26.6-38.4), for cTACE with Lipiodol-only (p = 0.844), respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The additional application of DSM during cTACE showed a significant benefit in tumor response according to mRECIST compared to cTACE with Lipiodol-only.

METHODS: 73 patients with unresectable HCC (BCLC-B) were included. Patients with tumor ≤ 5 cm were subjected to TACE (N = 45) while patients with tumors > 5 cm were subjected to TACE followed immediately by RFA (N = 28). QoL was evaluated with two validated questionnaires (EORTC QLQ-30 and EORTC HCC18). These questionnaires were filled out before intervention, 2 weeks and 2 months after intervention. Pre/post interventional changes were analyzed. The modified response evaluation criteria in solid tumor (mRECIST) were employed for the evaluation of therapeutic efficacy. RESULTS: Baseline global health status/QoL was significantly higher in TACE group (64.1%) compared to TACE-RFA group (51.2%). Two weeks after intervention: the absolute decrease in global health state was higher in TACE-RFA (- 12.1%) compared to TACE (- 6.3%, p = 0.411). Less impairment was found in TACE group compared to TACE-RFA group for physical/social functioning, fatigue and pain but it was statistically insignificant. Two months after intervention; TACE-RFA group showed significant improvement in global health score, social and physical functioning scores, as well as significant improvement in pain and fatigue compared to TACE group. The therapeutic efficacy of TACE-RFA was better than TACE alone: complete remission, partial remission, stable disease and progressive disease were 17.9%, 32.1%, 42.9% and 7.1% Vs11.1%, 22.2%, 48.9% and 17.8%, respectively). CONCLUSION: Neither TACE nor TACE-RFA showed a significant decrease in QoL in patients with unresectable HCC two weeks after intervention. However, two months after intervention; TACE-RFA showed significant improvement in global health score compared to TACE monotherapy.

265,Clinical efficacy of ultrasound guided erector spinae plane block in patients undergoing microwave ablation.,10.15537/smj.2022.43.9.20220245,"OBJECTIVES: To compare the effect of pre-emptive erector spinae plane block (ESPB) applied before the procedure on opioid consumption during the procedure and analgesic demand and opioid consumption after the procedure. METHODS: American Society of Anesthesiologists Physical Status Classification (ASA) I-II, 30 patients, with liver tumor and planned for microwave ablation (MWA) treatment were included in the interventional radiology clinic, Erciyes University, Kayseri, Turkey, Turkey between 2021 and 2022. Patients were randomized either to the ESPB or control group. Ultrasound-guided ESPB block with 20 mL of 0.25% bupivacaine was performed preoperatively in the ESPB group patients, and the patients who was not performed the ESPB the control group. All the patients were administered 1 µg/kg fentanyl, 1-2 mg/kg propofol, and 1 mg/kg ketamine for sedation during the MWA procedure after standard monitoring. Total opioid consumption and numeric rating scale (NRS) scores for pain were recorded at 0, 20, 40, and 60 minutes, and at 2, 4, 6, 12, and 24 hours after the procedure. RESULTS: Total opioid consumption and total opioid amount during the procedure were statistically significantly lower in the ESPB group (p<0.001). Although all of the patients in the control group needed additional fentanyl throughout the procedure, only 5 patients in the ESPB group needed additional fentanyl (p<0.001). Post-procedure NRS score values were significantly lower in the ESPB group at 40 minutes, 60 minutes and 4 hours (p<0.05).

MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this single-center, two-arm, parallel-group, prospective randomized controlled study, we performed a 1:1 random allocation of eligible patients with HCCs to receive NT-RFA or conventional RFA between October 2016 and September 2018. The primary endpoint was the cumulative local tumor progression (LTP) rate after RFA. Secondary endpoints included technical conversion rates of NT-RFA, intrahepatic distance recurrence, extrahepatic metastasis, technical parameters, technical efficacy, and rates of complications. Cumulative LTP rates were analyzed using Kaplan-Meier analysis and the Cox proportional hazard regression model. Considering conversion cases from NT-RFA to conventional RFA, intention-to-treat and as-treated analyses were performed. RESULTS: Enrolled patients were randomly assigned to the NT-RFA group (37 patients with 38 HCCs) or the conventional RFA group (36 patients with 38 HCCs). Among the NT-RFA group patients, conversion to conventional RFA occurred in four patients (10.8%, 4/37). According to intention-to-treat analysis, both 1- and 3-year cumulative LTP rates were 5.6%, in the NT-RFA group, and they were 11.8% and 21.3%, respectively, in the conventional RFA group (p = 0.073, log-rank). In the as-treated analysis, LTP rates at 1 year and 3 years were 0% and 0%, respectively, in the NT-RFA group sand 15.6% and 24.5%, respectively, in the conventional RFA group (p = 0.004, log-rank). In as-treated analysis using multivariable Cox regression analysis, RFA type was the only significant predictive factor for LTP (hazard ratio = 0.061 with conventional RFA as the reference, 95% confidence interval = 0.000-0.497; p = 0.004). There were no significant differences in the procedure characteristics between the two groups. No procedure-related deaths or major complications were observed. CONCLUSION: NT-RFA using TICW electrodes in bipolar mode demonstrated significantly lower cumulative LTP rates than conventional RFA for small HCCs, which warrants a larger study for further confirmation.",Suh YS; Choi JW; Yoon JH; Lee DH; Kim YJ; Lee JH; Yu SJ; Cho EJ; Yoon JH; Lee JM,False,Intervention is not ICIs.

267,PRIME-HCC: phase Ib study of neoadjuvant ipilimumab and nivolumab prior to liver resection for hepatocellular carcinoma.,10.1186/s12885-021-08033-x,"BACKGROUND: After liver resection (LR), patients with hepatocellular cancer (HCC) are at high risk of recurrence. There are no approved anti-cancer therapies known to affect such risk, highlighting the acute need for novel systemic therapies to control the probability of disease relapse. Immunotherapy is expanding as a novel treatment option for HCC. Emerging data from cohort 4 of the CA209-040 study, which investigated the safety and preliminary efficacy of nivolumab/ipilimumab co-administration in advanced HCC, suggest that the combination can be delivered safely with an acceptable proportion of reversible grade 3-4 toxicities (27.1%) and a low discontinuation rate (2%) in patients with HCC. Here, we describe the design and rationale of PRIME-HCC, a two-part, multi-centre, phase Ib study to assess safety and bioactivity of the nivolumab/ipilimumab combination prior to LR in early-stage HCC. METHODS: The study involves an initial safety run-in phase (Part 1) to allow for preliminary safety characterisation within the first 6 patients enrolled and a subsequent expansion (Part 2). Ipilimumab will be administered once only on Day 1. Nivolumab will be administered on Day 1 and Day 22 (± 3 days) for a total of two 21-day cycles (i.e. 6 weeks of treatment). The primary objective of the study is to determine the safety and tolerability of the nivolumab/ipilimumab combination prior to LR. The secondary objective is to preliminarily characterize the efficacy of the combination prior to LR, including objective response rate (ORR) and pathologic response rates. Additional exploratory objectives include preliminary evidence of long-term disease control and to identify predictive correlates of response to the nivolumab/ipilimumab combination in HCC. DISCUSSION: The results of this study will help define the positioning of neoadjuvant nivolumab/ipilimumab combination in the perioperative management of HCC, with potential to improve survival outcomes in this patient population.

We aimed to determine the ability of preoperative gadoxetic acid-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings to predict CD8 cell density and PD-L1 expression in HCC. METHODS: A total of 120 patients with HCC who underwent 3.0-T gadoxetic acid-enhanced MRI before curative resection from January 2016 to June 2020 were enrolled and divided into a training set (n = 84) and a testing set (n = 36). Thirty-four patients with advanced stage HCC who received anti-PD-1 inhibitor between January 2017 and April 2020 and underwent pretreated gadoxetic acid-enhanced MRI scans were enrolled in an independent validation set. PD-L1 expression and CD8 cell infiltration were assessed with immunohistochemical staining, respectively. Two radiologists blinded to pathology results evaluated the pretreated MR features in consensus. Logistic regression and the receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) analyses were used to determine the value of image features to predict high CD8 cell density, PD-L1 positivity and the combination of high CD8 cell density and PD-L1 positivity in HCC in the training set and validated the findings in the testing set. The associations of MRI predictors with the objective response to immunotherapy were assessed in the independent validation. RESULTS: In the training set, the independent MRI predictors were irregular tumor margin (ITM, P = 0.008) and peritumoral low signal intensity (PLSI) on hepatobiliary phase (HBP) images (P < 0.001) for PD-L1 positivity, absence of an enhancing capsule (AEC, P = 0.001) and PLSI on HBP images (P = 0.025) for high CD8 cell density, and PLSI on HBP images (P = 0.001) and ITM (P = 0.023) for the both. The area under the curves (AUCs) of the predictive models for evaluating PD-L1 positivity, high CD8 cell density and the combination of high CD8 cell density and PD-L1 positivity were 0.810 and 0.809, 0.740 and 0.728, and 0.809 and 0.874 in the training and testing set, respectively. The objective response was demonstrated to be associated with the combination of PLSI on HBP images and ITM (PHI, P = 0.004), and the combination of PLSI on HBP images and AEC (PHA, P = 0.012) in the independent validation set. CONCLUSIONS: Pretreated MRI features have the potential to identify patients with HCC in an immune-activated state and predict outcomes of immunotherapy.

269,Liver disease severity predicts carcinogenesis of dysplastic liver nodules in cirrhosis.,10.1038/s41598-021-00474-5,"While dysplastic liver nodules in cirrhosis are pre-malignant, little is known about the predictors of hepatocarcinogenesis of these lesions. This was a retrospective observational study of subjects with cirrhosis who had at least one hypervascular, non-malignant intrahepatic nodule on imaging while undergoing outpatient management by a tertiary hepatology referral centre between Jan 2009 and Jan 2019. Clinical and biochemical parameters were collected. The primary endpoint was transformation to hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) as determined by Liver Imaging Reporting and Data System. During the study period, 163 non-malignant hypervascular nodules were identified in 77 patients; 147 had at least 6 months of follow up imaging and 16 received upfront radiofrequency ablation upon detection. During a median follow up of 38.5 months (IQR 16.5-74.5), 25 (17%) of the 147 hypervascular nodules being monitored transformed to HCC. On multivariate analysis, Child-Pugh grade was found to be the only independent predictor of nodule transformation into HCC (p = 0.02). Those with Child-Pugh B and C liver disease had a 10.1 (95% CI 1.22-83.8; p = 0.03) and 32.6-fold (95% CI 2.3-467; p = 0.01) increased risk respectively for HCC transformation compared to Child-Pugh A subjects. This large, single centre study demonstrates that around 20% of dysplastic nodules in cirrhotic patients undergo hepatocarcinogenesis during follow up, and that Child Pugh grade is the only independent predictor of transformation to HCC.

METHODS: 114 patients with unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma complicating hepatitis C virus-related cirrhosis were included. They underwent cTACE (58) or DEB-TACE (56). VEGF serum levels were measured before and on days 1 and 30 after TACE. Patients with complete response (CR) after TACE were followed-up for one year. Statistical analysis was done. RESULTS: VEGF level was higher than baseline after cTACE (P < 0.001), and DEB-TACE (P = 0.004). It was also significantly higher in patients with progressive disease (P < 0.001). VEGF level at cut off values of 97.3, 149.8, and 104.1 pg/ml could discriminate disease progression from treatment success with area under ROC curves of 0.806, 0.775, and 0.771, respectively. The sensitivity was 88.9%, 88.9%, and 77.8% and specificity was 62.5%, 64.6 and 66.7%, respectively. However, no relation to tumor recurrence in CR group could be detected after one year.

The purpose of this study was to investigate the characteristics, treatment patterns and outcomes of sorafenib among HCC patients in South Korea. METHODS: This population-based retrospective, single-arm, observational study used the Korean National Health Insurance database to identify patients with HCC who received sorafenib between July 1, 2008, and December 31, 2014. A total of 9,923 patients were recruited in this study. RESULTS: Among 9,923 patients, 6,669 patients (68.2%) received loco-regional therapy prior to sorafenib, and 1,565 patients (15.8%) received combination therapy with concomitant sorafenib; 2,591 patients (26.1%) received rescue therapy after sorafenib, and transarterial chemoembolization was the most common modality applied in 1,498 patients (15.1%). A total of 3,591 patients underwent rescue therapy after sorafenib, and the median overall survival was 14.5 months compared to 4.6 months in 7,332 patients who received supportive care after sorafenib. The mean duration of sorafenib administration in all patients was 105.7 days; 7,023 patients (70.8%) received an initial dose of 600 to 800 mg. The longest survival was shown in patients who received the recommended dose of 800 mg, subsequently reduced to 400 mg (15.0 months). The second longest survival was demonstrated in patients with a starting dose of 800 mg, followed by a dose reduction to 400-600 mg (9.6 months).

However, the safety and effect of drug-eluting bead transarterial chemoembolization (DEB-TACE) in patients with stage III-IV lung cancer are still unknown. PURPOSE: To evaluate the safety and efficacy of DEB-TACE with pirarubicin-loaded CB for the treatment of stage III-IV lung cancer. MATERIAL AND METHODS: From July 2016 to April 2020, 29 patients with stage III-IV primary lung cancer underwent DEB-TACE with pirarubicin-loaded CB. The objective response rate (ORR) was the primary endpoint; the secondary endpoints were progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS). RESULTS: Twenty-nine patients received DEB-TACE with pirarubicin-loaded (median 60 mg) CB, with no severe adverse events or treatment-related deaths. After DEB-TACE, hemoptysis disappeared within 1-3 days in all patients, and the symptoms of cough or expectoration were significantly improved in 12 patients. ORR and disease control rate at one, three, and six months after DEB-TACE were 39.3% and 96.4%, 26.1% and 69.6%, and 29.4% and 58.8%, respectively.

276,Selection of a Clinical Lead TCR Targeting Alpha-Fetoprotein-Positive Liver Cancer Based on a Balance of Risk and Benefit.,10.3389/fimmu.2020.00623,"Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the most common type of primary liver cancer with a poor prognosis and limited therapeutic options. Alpha-fetoprotein (AFP), an established clinical biomarker of HCC, has been employed as an attractive target for T cell-based immunotherapy against this disease given its high expression in the tumor and restricted expression in normal tissues. We have identified a number of T cell receptors (TCRs) recognizing the HLA-A(*)02:01 restricted AFP(158-166) peptide FMNKFIYEI, providing a TCR candidate pool for identifying TCRs with optimal clinical benefit. To select the ideal AFP TCR for clinical use, we evaluated the efficacy and safety profile of 7 TCRs by testing their potency toward AFP-expressing HCC cells and their specificity based upon reactivity to normal and transformed cells covering a wide variety of primary cell types and HLA serotypes. Furthermore, we assessed their cross-reactivity to potential protein candidates in the human genome by an extensive alanine scan (X-scan). We first selected three TCR candidates based on the in vitro anti-tumor activity. Next we eliminated two potential cross-reactive TCRs based on their reactivity against normal and transformed cells covering a variety of primary cell types and HLA serotypes, respectively. We then excluded the potential cross-reactivity of the selected TCR with a protein candidate identified by X-scan. At present we have selected an AFP TCR with the optimal affinity, function, and safety profile, bearing properties that are expected to allow AFP TCR redirected T cells to specifically differentiate between AFP levels on tumor and normal tissues. An early phase clinical trial using T cells transduced with this TCR to treat HCC patients (NCT03971747) has been initiated.

A total of 275 HCC patients were included in this prospective study. Treatment response was assessed by modified Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (mRECIST), and progression-free survival (PFS) as well as overall survival (OS) were determined. Liver function and adverse events (AEs) were assessed before and after DEB-TACE operation. Complete response (CR), partial response (PR), and objective response rate (ORR) were 22.9%, 60.7%, and 83.6%, respectively. The mean PFS was 362 (95% CI: 34.9-375) days, the 6-month PFS rate was 89.4 ± 2.1%, while the mean OS was 380 (95% CI: 370-389) days, and the 6-month OS rate was 94.4 ± 1.7%. Multivariate logistic regression revealed that portal vein invasion (p = 0.011) was an independent predictor of worse clinical response. Portal vein invasion (p = 0.040), previous cTACE treatment (p = 0.030), as well as abnormal serum creatinine level (BCr) (p = 0.017) were independent factors that predicted worse ORR. In terms of survival, higher Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC) stage (p = 0.029) predicted for worse PFS, and abnormal albumin (ALB) (p = 0.011) and total serum bilirubin (TBIL) (p = 0.009) predicted for worse OS. The number of patients with abnormal albumin, total protein (TP), TBIL, alanine aminotransferase (ALT), and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) were augmented at 1 week posttreatment and were similar at 1-3 months compared with baseline.

Expanded iNKT cells produced T-helper 1-like responses with possible antitumor activity. No severe adverse events were observed in any of the enrolled patients, including one patient who received 10(10) in vitro-expanded autologous iNKT cells as a single infusion. BACKGROUND: Invariant natural killer T cells co-express T-cell antigen receptor and natural killer (NK) cell receptors. Invariant natural killer T (iNKT) cells exhibit antitumor activity, but their numbers and functions are impaired in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The adoptive transfer of iNKT cells might treat advanced HCC. METHODS: This phase I study (NCT03175679) enrolled 10 patients with HCC (Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer [BCLC] stage B/C) at Beijing YouAn Hospital (April 2017 to May 2018). iNKT cells isolated from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were expanded and alpha-galactosylceramide (α-GalCer)-pulsed. Dosage escalated from 3 × 10(7) to 6 × 10(7) to 9 × 10(7) cells/m(2) (3+3 design). An exploratory dose trial (1 × 10(10) cells/m(2) ) was conducted in one patient. RESULTS: Expanded iNKT cells produced greater quantities of T-helper 1 (Th1) cytokines (e.g., interferon-gamma, perforin, and granzyme B) but less interleukin-4 than nonexpanded iNKT cells. Circulating numbers of iNKT cells and activated NK cells were increased after iNKT cell infusion. Most treatment-related adverse events were grade 1-2, and three grade 3 adverse events were reported; all resolved without treatment. Four patients were progression-free at 5.5, 6, 7, and 11 months after therapy, and one patient was alive and without tumor recurrence at the last follow-up. Five patients died at 1.5 to 11 months after treatment. CONCLUSION: Autologous iNKT cell treatment is safe and well-tolerated.

Moreover, we confirmed that HSP70 was highly expressed in HCC by immunohistochemical staining. Based on these results, we developed an HSP70 mRNA-transfected dendritic cell (DC) therapy for treating unresectable or recurrent HCC, and the phase I trial was completed successfully. Thus, we aimed to investigate the safety and efficacy of this therapy as a postoperative adjuvant treatment after curative resection for HCC to prevent recurrence by conducting a phase I/II randomized controlled clinical trial. METHODS: Patients (n = 45) with resectable HCC of stages II-IVa were registered and randomly assigned into two groups (DC group: 31 patients, control group: 14 patients) before surgery. The primary endpoint was disease-free survival (DFS), and the secondary endpoints were safety and overall survival. The DC therapy was initially administered at approximately 1 week after surgery, and twice every 3-4 weeks thereafter. RESULTS: No adverse events specific to the immunotherapy were observed in the DC group. There was no difference in DFS between the DC and control groups (p = 0.666). However, in the subgroup with HSP70-expressing HCC, DFS of the DC group tended to be better (p = 0.090) and OS of the DC group was significantly longer (p = 0.003) than those of the control group.

Studies have shown that transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (TACE) combined with high intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) has significant efficacy, but there are relatively few studies on TACE combined with HIFU in China. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effect of using HIFU combined with TACE on patients' liver function impairment and immune function in pediatric HB patients and to analyze the effectiveness and safety. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The clinical data of 110 unresectable pediatric HB patients treated in our hospital from December 2019 to December 2021 were selected as the subjects and divided into 2 groups. The comparison group was treated with TACE, and the combination group was treated with HIFU on the basis of the comparison group. The differences in immune function, survival, treatment side effects and clinical efficacy between the 2 groups were observed. RESULTS: In the combined group, the 1-year survival rate was 100%, the 3-year survival rate was 84.0%, the 5-year survival rate was 16.0%; while in comparison group, it was 82%, 16%, 0%, respectively. The ratio of CD4+/CD8+ in the combined group were significantly higher than in the comparison group after treatment (P < .05). Granulocytopenia, mucositis, thrombocytopenia, and cardiac and renal toxicity were significantly lower in the combined group than in the comparison group, and the effective rate of the combined group was 98.00% which was significantly higher than that of the control group (76.00%) (P < .05).

281,Macrophage migration inhibitory factor predicts an unfavorable outcome after transarterial chemoembolization for hepatic malignancies.,10.1111/cts.13033,"Transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) is a therapeutic option for patients with intermediate-stage hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) or metastatic liver cancers. Identifying those patients who particularly benefit from TACE remains challenging. Macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) represents is an inflammatory protein described in patients with liver cancer, but no data on its prognostic relevance in patients undergoing TACE exist. Here, we evaluate MIF serum concentrations as a potential biomarker in patients undergoing TACE for primary and secondary hepatic malignancies. MIF serum concentrations were measured by multiplex immunoassay in 50 patients (HCC: n = 39, liver metastases: n = 11) before and 1 day after TACE as well as in 51 healthy controls. Serum concentrations of MIF did not differ between patients and healthy controls. Interestingly, in the subgroup of patients with larger tumor size, significantly more patients had increased MIF concentrations. Patients with an objective tumor response to TACE therapy showed comparable concentrations of serum MIF compared to patients who did not respond. MIF concentrations at day 1 after TACE were significantly higher compared to baseline concentrations. Importantly, baseline MIF concentrations above the optimal cutoff value (0.625 ng/ml) turned out as a significant and independent prognostic marker for a reduced overall survival (OS) following TACE: patients with elevated MIF concentrations showed a significantly reduced median OS of only 719 days compared to patients below the cutoff value (median OS: 1430 days, p = 0.021). Baseline MIF serum concentrations are associated with tumor size of intrahepatic malignancies and predict outcome of patients with liver cancer receiving TACE.

METHODS: This is a single centre, retrospective, and observational study. Exclusion criteria were not-assisted DP-CBCT TACE, and unavailable follow-up SLIM. We evaluated 280 consecutive patients (January/2015-Febraury/2019). Seventy-two patients were eligible. Three radiologists in consensus reviewed: pre-procedural SLIM, DP-CBCT, and SLIM at follow-up, with 4 months of interval between each reading. Hyper-vascular foci (HVF) were detected and characterized. Diameter was recorded. Radiological behaviour, according to LI-RADS criteria, of HFV throughout follow-up time was the reference standard. Diagnostic accuracy was calculated for pre-procedural SLIM and DP-CBCT and evaluated through receiver operating characteristic curve. HVF only visible on DP-CBCT (defined as occult) were analysed. Tumour diameters were compared. RESULTS: Median time between pre-procedural SLIM and DP-CBCT and between DP-CBCT and definitive radiological diagnosis of HVF were 46.0 days (95%CI 36.5-55.0) and 30.5 days (95%CI 29.0-33.0), respectively. DP-CBCT had a better diagnostic performance than pre-examination SLIM (sensitivity 99%vs78%; specificity 89%vs85%; PPV 99%vs99%; NPV 92%vs30%; and accuracy 94%vs79%). DP-CBCT diagnosed 63 occult HVF.

283,MHC-restricted phosphopeptide antigens: preclinical validation and first-in-humans clinical trial in participants with high-risk melanoma.,10.1136/jitc-2019-000262,"BACKGROUND: Phosphorylated peptides presented by MHC molecules represent a new class of neoantigens expressed on cancer cells and recognized by CD8 T-cells. These peptides are promising targets for cancer immunotherapy. Previous work identified an HLA-A*0201-restricted phosphopeptide from insulin receptor substrate 2 (pIRS2) as one such target. The purpose of this study was to characterize a second phosphopeptide, from breast cancer antiestrogen resistance 3 (BCAR3), and to evaluate safety and immunogenicity of a novel immunotherapic vaccine comprising either or both of these phosphorylated peptides. METHODS: Phosphorylated BCAR3 protein was evaluated in melanoma and breast cancer cell lines by Western blot, and recognition by T-cells specific for HLA-A*0201-restricted phosphorylated BCAR3 peptide (pBCAR3(126-134)) was determined by (51)Cr release assay and intracellular cytokine staining. Human tumor explants were also evaluated by mass spectrometry for presentation of pIRS2 and pBCAR3 peptides. For the clinical trial, participants with resected stage IIA-IV melanoma were vaccinated 6 times over 12 weeks with one or both peptides in incomplete Freund's adjuvant and Hiltonol (poly-ICLC). Adverse events (AEs) were coded based on National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) V.4.03, with provision for early study termination if dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) rates exceeded 33%. The enrollment target was 12 participants evaluable for immune response to each peptide. T-cell responses were assessed by interferon-γ ELISpot assay. RESULTS: pBCAR3 peptides were immunogenic in vivo in mice, and in vitro in normal human donors, and T-cells specific for pBCAR3(126-134) controlled outgrowth of a tumor xenograft. The pIRS2(1097-1105) peptide was identified by mass spectrometry from human hepatocellular carcinoma tumors. In the clinical trial, 15 participants were enrolled. All had grade 1 or 2 treatment-related AEs, but there were no grade 3-4 AEs, DLTs or deaths on study. T-cell responses were induced to the pIRS2(1097-1105) peptide in 5/12 patients (42%, 90% CI 18% to 68%) and to the pBCAR3(126-134) peptide in 2/12 patients (17%, 90% CI 3% to 44%). CONCLUSION: This study supports the safety and immunogenicity of vaccines containing the cancer-associated phosphopeptides pBCAR3(126-134) and pIRS2(1097-1105), and the data support continued development of immune therapy targeting phosphopeptides.

Real-world patterns of recurrence and the prognostic significance of early recurrence in U.S. clinical practice have not been well characterized. METHODS: This retrospective observational study was designed to evaluate the impact of recurrence on overall survival (OS) among patients with HCC following initial curative-intent resection or ablation. We used the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results cancer registry linked with Medicare claims (January 1, 2010-December 31, 2019). Eligible patients (≥66 years) diagnosed with HCC (2010-2017) had liver resection or ablation within 180 days of diagnosis. Patients were stratified by recurrence status using diagnosis- and treatment-based definitions of recurrence. Early or late recurrence was defined as within 1 year or after 1 year, respectively. Adjusted OS analyses used multivariable Cox regression models. RESULTS: A total of 1,146 patients were included. During a median overall follow-up of 35.2 months, 736 (64%) patients had a recurrence, of whom 380 (52%) had early recurrence (within 1 year). In the adjusted analysis, patients with recurrence had a 2.24-fold higher risk of death (95% confidence interval 1.85, 2.71; P < 0.001). Patients with early recurrence had a 1.39-fold higher risk of death (95% confidence interval 1.14, 1.68; P < 0.001) than those with late recurrence.

However, the expression and role of S100 family members in the prognosis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remains unclear. To investigate the effect of S100 family members for the prognosis of liver cancer, we assessed overall survival (OS) using a Kaplan-Meier plotter (KM plotter) in liver cancer patients with different situation. Our results showed that 15 members of the S100 family exhibited high levels of expression and these levels were correlated with OS in liver cancer patients. The higher expression of S100A5, S100A7, S100A7A, S100A12, S100Z, and S100G was reflected with better survival in liver cancer patients. However, worse prognosis was related to higher levels of expression of S100A2, S100A6, S100A8, S100A9, S100A10, S100A11, S10013, S100A14, and S100P. We then evaluated the prognostic values of S100 family members expression for evaluating different stages of AJCC-T, vascular invasion, alcohol consumption, and the presence of hepatitis virus in liver cancer patients. Lastly, we studied the prognostic values of S100 family members expression for patients after sorafenib treatment.

287,"Preoperative Chemotherapy Followed by Hepatectomy for Potentially Resectable UICC7 Stage IIIA, IIIB Hepatocellular Carcinoma; A Phase II Clinical Trial.",10.2739/kurumemedj.MS6834010,"BACKGROUND: The Japanese guideline for therapeutic strategy in HCC does not recognize any benefit of preoperative chemotherapy for potentially resectable hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), and only upfront resec tion is recommended even for an advanced HCC. Data on preoperative chemotherapy for advanced HCC is still limited. Poor prognostic factors of HCC after resection are tumor more than 5 cm in diameter, multiple lesions, and gross tumor thrombosis, which constitute UICC7 Stage IIIA and IIIB HCC. There are no prospective studies about preoperative chemotherapy in these patients. AIM: To evaluate the benefit of preoperative chemotherapy for UICC7 Stage IIIA and IIIB potentially resectable HCC. DISCUSSION: Our recent study demonstrated that the 5-year overall survival rate (OS) of patients diagnosed as UICC7 Stage IIIA and IIIB who had received upfront resection was only 16.5%. In contrast, the 5-year OS of UICC7 Stage IIIA and IIIB initially unresectable patients who had achieved conversion from unresectable to resect able status under successful hepatic infusion chemotherapy prior to resection was as high as 61.3%. Additionally, recent studies reported transarterial chemoembolization achieved outcomes comparable with those of resection. Therefore, we believe that patients with UICC7 Stage IIIA and IIIB should be considered borderline resectable. To evaluate this hypothesis we registered the present phase II clinical trial to assess the benefit of preoperative chemo therapy followed by hepatectomy in potentially resectable UICC7 Stage IIIA and IIIB HCC patients.",Goto Y; Niizeki T; Fukutomi S; Shirono T; Shimose S; Iwamoto H; Kojima S; Kanno H; Uchino Y; Sasaki S; Shirahama N; Muroya D; Nomura Y; Akashi M; Nakayama G; Hirakawa Y; Sato T; Yoshitomi M; Sakai H; Hisaka T; Kakuma T; Koga H; Torimura T; Akagi Y; Okuda K,False,"Intervention is preoperative chemotherapy, not immune checkpoint inhibitors.

288,"A multicenter, randomized, parallel-controlled clinical trial protocol to evaluate the safety and efficacy of irreversible electroporation compared with radiofrequency ablation for the treatment of small hepatocellular carcinoma.",10.1186/s12957-024-03614-z,"BACKGROUND: At present, the main clinical application of local ablation therapy, such as radiofrequency ablation (RFA), is to heat the tissue to a certain temperature. However, high temperature will cause thermal damage. Irreversible electroporation (IRE) is a novel minimally invasive local ablation technology for tumors. By high-frequency pulse, the tumor cell membrane can be irretrievably perforated, resulting in the destruction of the intracellular environment, which can preserve important structures in the treatment area. However, there are no randomized controlled clinical trials comparing the efficacy of IRE with traditional local ablation in the treatment of liver cancer. AIMS: This study aims to conduct a randomized controlled clinical trial comparing the efficacy of IRE with RFA in the treatment of liver cancer. METHODS: We will conduct a multicenter, randomized, parallel-controlled non-inferiority clinical trial to compare the efficacy and safety of IRE and RFA for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). One hundred and ninety patients with HCC from five academic medical centers will be enrolled. The patients will be randomized into treatment arm (IRE) and control arm (RFA). The primary outcome is the progress -free survival (PFS) and the key secondary outcome is the Overall survival (OS). RESULTS: Forty-eight patients had been recruited from 5 centers, of which, 33 patients (median age, 59.1 years) with 38 tumors had completed the 1-month follow-up and 21 patients have complete the 3-month follow up, with 2.3 months median follow up period. The mean largest tumor diameter is 3.9 cm. No end point was observed for PFS or OS in both groups, and the complete ablation rate was 100% in both groups. The lesions in the IRE group showed obvious shrinkage 1 month after procedure. One major adverse event (AE) was occurred in the control group. CONCLUSION: This is the first randomized controlled clinical trial to compare the clinical effects of IRE and RFA. The preliminary results suggest that both RFA and IRE are effective in the treatment of HCC, which can provide strong evidence for the use of IRE in HCC and provide more options for the treatment of patients with HCC.

289,Radiomics Signature: A potential biomarker for the prediction of survival in Advanced Hepatocellular Carcinoma.,10.7150/ijms.55510,"Objectives: To develop and validate radiomics nomograms for the pretreatment predictions of overall survival (OS) and time to progression (TTP) in the patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) treated with apatinib plus transarterial chemoembolization (TACE), and to assess the incremental value of the clinical-radiomics nomograms for estimating individual OS and TTP. Methods: A total of 60 patients with advanced HCC (BCLC stage C) treated with apatinib plus TACE were divided into a training set (n=48) and a validation set (n=12). The predictors identified from the clinical variables and the radiomics signature constructed from the computed tomography images, such as ɑ-fetoprotein level (AFP), formfactor, the grey level co-occurrence matrix, the gray level size zone matrix, and the gray level run-length matrix, were used to build the clinical-radiomics nomograms and the radiomics nomograms for the prediction of OS and TTP. Results: Apatinib plus TACE benefited the patients with advanced HCC, with a 579-day median OS and a 270-day median TTP. The nomograms were built with the radiomics signature and AFP, and achieved favorable prediction efficacy with acceptable calibration curves. Decision curve analyses demonstrated that the clinical-radiomics nomograms outperformed the radiomics nomograms for the predictions of OS and TTP. Conclusions: Apatinib plus TACE may improve OS and prolonged TTP in the patients with advanced HCC. The clinical-radiomics nomograms, a noninvasive pretreatment prediction tool that incorporate radiomics signature and AFP, demonstrated good prediction accuracy for OS and TTP in these patients. These results indicate that the clinical-radiomics nomograms may provide novel insight for precise personalized medicine approaches in the patients with advanced HCC.",Li L; Kan X; Zhao Y; Liang B; Ye T; Yang L; Zheng C,False,"Intervention is apatinib plus TACE, not immune checkpoint inhibitors.

We have encountered several cases in which albumin-bilirubin (ALBI) scores deteriorated markedly and C-reactive protein (CRP) levels elevated in the early post-dose period. The present study therefore investigated early clinical changes in ALBI score and CRP levels after initiating MTA in advanced HCC patients with ≥50% liver occupation, focusing on antitumor response at 6 weeks.This retrospective study included 46 HCC patients with liver occupation ≥50% and 191 patients with <50%, Child-Pugh score ≤7, and Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group Performance Status scores of 0 or 1, who were treated with sorafenib or lenvatinib as first-line systemic therapy at our hospital between June 2011 and January 2020.

METHODS A total of 120 patients with HCC undergoing TACE for the first time between January and November 2019 were randomized into 4 groups with 30 patients in each group. In group A, patients were placed in the foot-first position with the left upper arm abducted, and TACE was performed via the left radial artery. In group B, patients were placed in the conventional headfirst position with the left hand placed at the left groin, and TACE was performed via the left radial artery. In group C, patients were placed in the conventional head-first position, and TACE was performed via the right radial artery. In group D, patients were placed in the conventional head-first position, and TACE was performed via the right femoral artery. Before each procedure, thermoluminescent dosimeters were taped at 7 different body parts of the operator and the radiation dose was measured and collected after the procedure. The normalized radiation dose was also calculated. Procedural parameters included radiation dose, fluoroscopy time (FT), dose-area product (DAP), and air kerma (AK) were recorded. Patients' demographics, tumor baseline characteristics, radiation dose, and procedural parameters were compared between groups. RESULTS No significant differences were found in patients' demographics, tumor baseline characteristics, as well as in total FT, DAP, and AK. However, significant differences were found in the total radiation dose received by the operator and the doses on the pelvic cavity and the right wrist (P < .05). In group C, the radiation doses received on the pelvic cavity, the right wrist, and the total radiation doses were relatively higher. Significant differences were also found in the normalized radiation doses received by the operator on the thyroid, chest, left wrist, right wrist, and pelvic cavity, and the total normalized doses (all P < .05). Similarly, the radiation doses received by the operator at the aforementioned parts in group C were higher, while those in group A were lower. CONCLUSION No statistically significant differences were observed in the FT, DAP, and AK in TACE via TRA when patients were placed in different positions.

292,Modular multimodal hospital-home chain physical activity rehabilitation programme (3M2H-PARP) in liver cancer: a protocol for a randomised controlled trial.,10.1136/bmjopen-2023-083228,"INTRODUCTION: Patients with liver cancer are susceptible to experiencing a decline in muscle mass and function, which can lead to physical frailty and have a negative impact on prognosis. However, there is currently a lack of physical activity interventions specifically tailored for these patients. Therefore, we have developed a modular multimodal hospital-home chain physical activity rehabilitation programme (3M2H-PARP) designed specifically for patients with liver cancer undergoing transarterial chemoembolisation (TACE). We aim to validate the effectiveness and feasibility of this programme through a randomised controlled trial (RCT). METHODS AND ANALYSIS: 3M2H-PARP RCT will compare a 12-week, modular, multimodal physical activity rehabilitation programme that includes supervised exercise in a hospital setting and self-management exercise at home. The programmes consist of aerobic, resistance, flexibility and balance exercise modules, and standard survivorship care in a cohort of liver cancer survivors who have undergone TACE. The control group will receive standard care. A total of 152 participants will be randomly assigned to either the 3M2H-PARP group or the control group. Assessments will be conducted at three time points: baseline, after completing the intervention and a 24-week follow-up visit. The following variables will be evaluated: liver frailty index, Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Hepatobiliary subscale, Cancer Fatigue Scale, Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale and physical activity level. After the completion of the training programme, semi-structured interviews will be conducted with participants from the 3M2H-PARP group to investigate the programme's impact on their overall well-being. SPSS V.26.0 software will be used for statistical analyses. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Ethical approval has been granted by the Jiangnan University School of Medicine Research Ethics Committee.

We compared the efficacy of TACE with cisplatin versus with epirubicin in patients with unresectable HCC. METHODS: This multicentre, randomised, phase 2/3 trial was performed at 21 hospitals in Japan. Patients with liver-confined HCC, performance status 0-2, and Child-Pugh class A/B were randomised to receive TACE with cisplatin or epirubicin. Patients were stratified in accordance with the institution, Child-Pugh class, tumour size, tumour thrombosis, α-fetoprotein and prior treatment. The primary end-point was overall survival in the intention-to-treat population. Tumour response was evaluated in accordance with the Response evaluation criteria in solid tumours criteria. FINDINGS: Between 2008 and 2012, 455 patients were randomly assigned to undergo TACE with cisplatin (n = 228) or epirubicin (n = 227). Eleven patients were ineligible, and 444 patients were included in the full analysis. Twelve patients not receiving TACE were excluded, and 432 patients were included in the safety analysis set. In phase 2, disease control rates in cisplatin (91·7%) and epirubicin (91·8%) groups exceeded the predefined threshold of 70%, and the study proceeded to phase 3. After a median follow-up of 32·7 months (IQR = 15·3-49·3), median overall survival periods were 2·93 years (95% CI 2·60-3·79) and 2·74 years (95%CI 2·26-3·21), respectively (hazard ratio 0·90 [95% CI 0·71-1·15], p = 0·22).

294,A nomogram model to predict prognosis of patients with hepatoblastoma.,10.1002/pbc.29932,"BACKGROUND: Hepatoblastomas (HBs) are malignant liver tumors that most commonly develop in pediatric patients. Microvascular invasion may be a prognosis factor for patients with HBs. This study aimed to construct a model to predict the survival outcome in HBs. METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed the clinical data of 311 patients with HBs who underwent surgical resection at our institution between June 2014 and August 2021. First, patients were divided into two groups: those who had pathologic microvascular invasion (n = 146) and those who did not (n = 165). Propensity score-matched (PSM) analysis was carried out between the two groups. The preoperative parameters and overall survival (OS) rate were compared between the two groups. Second, all 311 patients were randomly divided into the training and validation cohort in a ratio of 4:1. A nomogram was created in the training cohort to visualize the prediction of OS. Moreover, the validation cohort was used for validation. RESULTS: Multivariate analysis suggested that age, histology type, microvascular invasion, multifocality, distant metastasis, and macrovascular involvement are independent prognostic factors for HBs. The nomogram showed good predictive ability in the training and validation cohorts with a C-index of 0.878 (95% CI, 0.831-0.925) and 0.847 (95% CI, 0.757-0.937), respectively. The calibration curve indicated good agreement between the prediction and observation for one-, two-, and three-year OS probabilities.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients were affected by hepatocellularcarcinoma (HCC) in intermediate stage or previous stages unfit for ablation and/or surgery; they were randomized into two groups according to arterial access site (Group F: right femoral access in standard position; Group R: radial access with left arm abduced 90°). Overall fluoroscopy time was recorded. Eight thermoluminescence dosimeters were positioned immediately before each procedure to monitor radiation doses. Technical success was intended as complete HCC nodules lipiodolization at final plain cone-beam CT. RESULTS: Group F included 23 patients, while group R 19. Mean fluoroscopy time was lower in group F but difference was not statistically significant (p-value > 0.05). In terms of operators radiations exposure, no significant differences were found (p-value > 0.05). Technical success was obtained in 81.5% in group F and 84.8% in group R, without significant differences (p-value > 0.05). Patients discomfort was significantly (p-value < 0.05) higher in group F. Concerning minor complications, no statistical differences were appreciated (p-value > 0.05); no major complications occurred. CONCLUSIONS: In this study, no statistical differences were observed in terms of operators radiations exposure, fluoroscopy time and technical success during c-TACE performed with left radial access compared to right femoral access; patients comfort was significantly better with radial access.

This study was to investigate liver stiffness (LS) and metabolic factor in prediction of HCC recurrence for patients with early stage HCC who had undergone curative resection. Consecutive patients with suspicion of HCC who had undergone curative resection were prospectively enrolled. Transient elastography was performed to determine LS pre-operatively. The demographics, clinical characteristics and histological findings were recorded. All patients were followed up regularly until recurrence, death or last visit. Ninety-four patients with early stage HCC were enrolled. LS positively correlated with fibrosis stage (r = 0.666). In a median follow-up of 3.2 years, forty patients developed recurrences including 22 recurrences after 1-year post resection. The 5-year cumulative recurrence rate was 44.2%. LS was the independent factor associated with recurrence. Patients with LS > 8.5 kPa had higher 5-year cumulative recurrence rate (59.8% vs 25.1%, p = 0.007).

METHODS: Prospective and retrospective observational cohort study. RESULTS: 3377 patients were included: 606 with SLE, 1015 with non-SLE autoimmune-mediated rheumatic diseases (ARD) and 1756 with non-ARD diseases (hepatocellular carcinoma, primary biliary cirrhosis, autoimmune hepatitis). The 2019 criteria were more sensitive than the 1997 criteria (87.0% vs 81.8%), but less specific (98.1% vs 99.5% in the entire cohort and 96.5% vs 98.8% in patients with non-SLE ARD), resulting in Youden Indexes for patients with SLE/non-SLE ARD of 0.835 and 0.806, respectively. The most sensitive items were history of antinuclear antibody (ANA) positivity and detection of anti-double-stranded deoxyribonucleic acid (dsDNA) antibodies. These were also the least specific items. The most specific items were class III/IV lupus nephritis and the combination of low C3 and low C4 complement levels, followed by class II/V lupus nephritis, either low C3 or low C4 complement levels, delirium and psychosis, when these were not attributable to non-SLE causes. CONCLUSIONS: In this cohort from an independent academic medical centre, the sensitivity and specificity of the 2019 lupus classification criteria were confirmed.

298,Health-related quality of life improves after entecavir treatment in patients with compensated HBV cirrhosis.,10.1007/s12072-021-10240-4,"BACKGROUND AND AIM: Antiviral therapy is effective in decreasing disease progression in HBV cirrhosis. However, the long-term effect of antiviral therapy on health-related quality of life (HRQoL) in patients with compensated HBV cirrhosis is unknown. METHODS: The patients with compensated HBV cirrhosis enrolled in a randomized controlled trial of entecavir-based therapy were recruited in the present study, if they had HRQoL score at 5-year follow-up or who developed liver-related events (LRE) during follow-up were included. HRQoL was measured with 36-Item Short-Form Health Survey (SF-36) and EuroQol-5D (EQ-5D) at baseline and yearly during follow-up. LRE was defined as the development of decompensation, HCC, or death. RESULTS: A total of 161 patients were included in the present study, with a median age of 48.0 (41.0, 53.0) years, 77.6% being male and 37.2% being HBeAg-positive. During 5 years, 45 patients developed LRE. All eight dimensions of SF-36 were significantly improved after 5 years of antiviral therapy (all p < 0.001), with all dimensions improved more than five points except for physical functioning. Proportion of patients reporting no problems in all five dimensions in EQ-5D increased from 57.8 to 72.0%; visual analogue scale (VAS) and utility index (UI) increased significantly (VAS 79.8 ± 16.4 to 84.4 ± 13.2, UI 0.91 ± 0.13 to 0.95 ± 0.10, both p < 0.001). HRQoL improved or kept stable in the majority of patients who had LRE during follow-up, even stratified by Baveno VI criteria for clinically significant portal hypertension.

299,Rehabilitation strategies following oesophagogastric and Hepatopancreaticobiliary cancer (ReStOre II): a protocol for a randomized controlled trial.,10.1186/s12885-020-06889-z,"BACKGROUND: Curative treatment for upper gastrointestinal (UGI) and hepatopancreaticobiliary (HPB) cancers, involves complex surgical resection often in combination with neoadjuvant/adjuvant chemo/chemoradiotherapy. With advancing survival rates, there is an emergent cohort of UGI and HPB cancer survivors with physical and nutritional deficits, resultant from both the cancer and its treatments. Therefore, rehabilitation to counteract these impairments is required to maximise health related quality of life (HRQOL) in survivorship. The initial feasibility of a multidisciplinary rehabilitation programme for UGI survivors was established in the Rehabilitation Strategies following Oesophago-gastric Cancer (ReStOre) feasibility study and pilot randomised controlled trial (RCT). ReStOre II will now further investigate the efficacy of that programme as it applies to a wider cohort of UGI and HPB cancer survivors, namely survivors of cancer of the oesophagus, stomach, pancreas, and liver. METHODS: The ReStOre II RCT will compare a 12-week multidisciplinary rehabilitation programme of supervised and self-managed exercise, dietary counselling, and education to standard survivorship care in a cohort of UGI and HPB cancer survivors who are > 3-months post-oesophagectomy/ gastrectomy/ pancreaticoduodenectomy, or major liver resection. One hundred twenty participants (60 per study arm) will be recruited to establish a mean increase in the primary outcome (cardiorespiratory fitness) of 3.5 ml/min/kg with 90% power, 5% significance allowing for 20% drop out. Study outcomes of physical function, body composition, nutritional status, HRQOL, and fatigue will be measured at baseline (T0), post-intervention (T1), and 3-months follow-up (T2). At 1-year follow-up (T3), HRQOL alone will be measured. The impact of ReStOre II on well-being will be examined qualitatively with focus groups/interviews (T1, T2). Bio-samples will be collected from T0-T2 to establish a national UGI and HPB cancer survivorship biobank. The cost effectiveness of ReStOre II will also be analysed. DISCUSSION: This RCT will investigate the efficacy of a 12-week multidisciplinary rehabilitation programme for survivors of UGI and HPB cancer compared to standard survivorship care. If effective, ReStOre II will provide an exemplar model of rehabilitation for UGI and HPB cancer survivors.

Transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) is a commonly selected therapeutic option for intermediate and later stage HCC in China, but patients often suffer from postembolization syndrome (PES), manifesting as fever, liver area pain, nausea, vomiting, paralyzed intestinal obstruction, and abdominal pain after TACE. We try to conduct a double blinded, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial to observe whether Chaihu Guizhi decoction (CGD), a classic traditional Chinese formula, could prophylactically alleviate the incidence of PES in HCC patients after TACE. METHODS: Patients will be randomly assigned sequentially in a 1:1 ratio by using preformed randomization envelopes. After TACE procedures, patients in the treatment group will be administrated with Chinese herbal formula CGD, and patients in the control group with CGD simulations, twice a day, continuously for 7 days. The outcomes are the incidence of PES hospitalization and, complications. SPSS version 22 (IBM, Chicago, IL) will be used for the data, and a P < .05 will be considered statistically significant.

303,Liver transplantation versus watchful waiting in hepatocellular carcinoma patients with complete response to bridging therapy - a retrospective observational study.,10.1111/tri.13808,"Bridging therapy to prevent progression on the waiting list can result in a sustained complete response (sCR). In some patients, the liver transplantation (LT) risk might exceed those of tumor recurrence. We thus evaluated whether a watchful waiting (CR-WW) strategy could be a feasible alternative to transplantation (CR-LT). We performed a retrospective analysis of overall survival (OS) and recurrence-free survival (RFS) of patients with a sCR (CR > 6 months). Permitted bridging included thermoablation, resection, and combinations of either with transarterial chemoembolization. Patients were divided into the intended treatment strategies CR-WW and CR-LT. 39 (18.40%) sCR patients from 212 were investigated. 22 patients were treated with a CR-LT and 17 patients a CR-WW strategy. Five-year RFS was lower in the CR-WW than in the CR-LT group [53.3% (22.1%; 77.0%) and 84.0% (57.6%; 94.7%)]. 29.4% (5/17) CR-WW patients received salvage transplantation because of recurrence. OS (5-year) was 83.9% [56.8%; 94.7%] after LT and 75.4% [39.8%; 91.7%] after WW.

KEYNOTE-240 (NCT02702401) assessed the efficacy and safety of pembrolizumab plus best supportive care (BSC) versus placebo plus BSC in patients with HCC who previously received sorafenib. This study presents the results of a prespecified exploratory analysis of patient-reported outcomes. METHODS: Patients completed the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Core Quality of Life Questionnaire (EORTC QLQ-C30) and its HCC supplement (EORTC QLQ-HCC18) electronically at baseline; at weeks 2, 3, 4, 6, 9, 12, and 18; and then every 9 weeks until 1 year or end of treatment, and at the 30-day safety follow-up visit. RESULTS: The HRQoL population included 271 and 127 patients randomly assigned to pembrolizumab and placebo, respectively. From baseline to week 12, changes in both scores were similar between pembrolizumab and placebo; global health status/QoL scores were stable. The proportions of patients who improved, remained stable, or deteriorated across all functional domain and symptom scores were generally similar between pembrolizumab and placebo. Time to deterioration was similar between the 2 arms based on the prespecified analysis of EORTC QLQ-HCC18 domains of abdominal swelling, fatigue, and pain. CONCLUSION: Pembrolizumab preserved HRQoL during treatment for advanced HCC.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: This single-center, randomized, phase II, intent-to-treat trial is enrolling 100 subjects with primary and secondary liver tumors (≤ 3 tumors, 1-5 cm in diameter) undergoing microwave or radiofrequency ablation with a goal of achieving ≥ 5 mm MAM. For the experimental arm, the proposed novel AC method is utilized for ablation applicator(s) placement verification and MAM assessment. For the control arm, the same variables are assessed by visual inspection and anatomical landmarks-based quantitative measurements aided by co-registration of pre- and post-ablation contrast-enhanced CT images. The primary objective is to evaluate the impact of the proposed AC method on the MAM. Secondary objectives are 2-year LTP-free survival, complication rates, quality of life, liver function, other oncological outcomes, and impact of AC method on procedure workflow. DISCUSSION: The COVER-ALL trial will provide information on the role of a biomechanical deformable image registration-based ablation confirmation method incorporating AI-based auto-segmentation for improving MAM, which might translate in improvements of liver ablation efficacy.

METHODS: Eligible adults had aHCC, progression after ≥4 weeks of sorafenib, and, for Phase 2 only, MET overexpression. Tepotinib was administered once daily at 300 or 500 mg in Phase 1b ('3 + 3' design), and at the recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) in Phase 2. Primary endpoints were dose-liming toxicities (DLTs; Phase 1b) and 12-week investigator-assessed progression-free survival (PFS; Phase 2). RESULTS: In Phase 1b (n = 17), no DLTs occurred and the RP2D was confirmed as 500 mg. In Phase 2 (n = 49), the primary endpoint was met: 12-week PFS was 63.3% (90% CI: 50.5-74.7), which was significantly greater than the predefined null hypothesis of ≤15% (one-sided binomial exact test: P < 0.0001). Median time to progression was 4 months. In Phase 2, 28.6% of patients had treatment-related Grade ≥3 adverse events, including peripheral oedema and lipase increase (both 6.1%).

Postembolisation syndrome (PES) is the most common side effect from TACE and there is still no standard prevention guideline. AIM: To evaluate the efficacy of single dose intravenous dexamethasone regimen to prevent PES after TACE among patients with HCC. METHODS: This study enrolled patients with HCC who had eligible indication for TACE without macrovascular invasion/extrahepatic metastasis. Patients were randomly assigned to either an intravenous single dose of dexamethasone 8 mg or placebo one hour before TACE. The primary outcome was a negative result of PES at 48 h after TACE, which was defined as score < 2 of Southwest Oncology Group toxicity coding criteria using fever, nausea, vomiting and pain to calculated. And the secondary end point was duration of admission between two groups. RESULTS: One hundred patients were randomly assigned 1:1. Under intention-to-treat analysis, 49 patients were randomly assigned to the dexamethasone and 51 to the placebo groups. Both groups were similar for baseline characteristics. The negative PES rate was significantly higher in the dexamethasone group than in the placebo group (63.3% vs 29.4%; P = 0.005). Mean Southwest Oncology Group toxicity coding PES was 2.14 (95%CI: 1.41-2.8) vs 3.71 (95%CI: 2.97-4.45) between the dexamethasone and placebo groups, respectively.

308,Longitudinal Accumulation of Cerebral Microhemorrhages in Dominantly Inherited Alzheimer Disease.,10.1212/WNL.0000000000011542,"OBJECTIVE: To investigate the inherent clinical risks associated with the presence of cerebral microhemorrhages (CMHs) or cerebral microbleeds and characterize individuals at high risk for developing hemorrhagic amyloid-related imaging abnormality (ARIA-H), we longitudinally evaluated families with dominantly inherited Alzheimer disease (DIAD). METHODS: Mutation carriers (n = 310) and noncarriers (n = 201) underwent neuroimaging, including gradient echo MRI sequences to detect CMHs, and neuropsychological and clinical assessments. Cross-sectional and longitudinal analyses evaluated relationships between CMHs and neuroimaging and clinical markers of disease. RESULTS: Three percent of noncarriers and 8% of carriers developed CMHs primarily located in lobar areas. Carriers with CMHs were older, had higher diastolic blood pressure and Hachinski ischemic scores, and more clinical, cognitive, and motor impairments than those without CMHs. APOE ε4 status was not associated with the prevalence or incidence of CMHs. Prevalent or incident CMHs predicted faster change in Clinical Dementia Rating although not composite cognitive measure, cortical thickness, hippocampal volume, or white matter lesions. Critically, the presence of 2 or more CMHs was associated with a significant risk for development of additional CMHs over time (8.95 ± 10.04 per year). CONCLUSION: Our study highlights factors associated with the development of CMHs in individuals with DIAD. CMHs are a part of the underlying disease process in DIAD and are significantly associated with dementia. This highlights that in participants in treatment trials exposed to drugs, which carry the risk of ARIA-H as a complication, it may be challenging to separate natural incidence of CMHs from drug-related CMHs. behalf of the American Academy of Neurology.",Joseph-Mathurin N; Wang G; Kantarci K; Jack CR Jr; McDade E; Hassenstab J; Blazey TM; Gordon BA; Su Y; Chen G; Massoumzadeh P; Hornbeck RC; Allegri RF; Ances BM; Berman SB; Brickman AM; Brooks WS; Cash DM; Chhatwal JP; Chui HC; Correia S; Cruchaga C; Farlow MR; Fox NC; Fulham M; Ghetti B; Graff-Radford NR; Johnson KA; Karch CM; Laske C; Lee AKW; Levin J; Masters CL; Noble JM; O'Connor A; Perrin RJ; Preboske GM; Ringman JM; Rowe CC; Salloway S; Saykin AJ; Schofield PR; Shimada H; Shoji M; Suzuki K; Villemagne VL; Xiong C; Yakushev I; Morris JC; Bateman RJ; Benzinger TLS,False,"Population, intervention, and study design do not match",families with DIAD,not specified,not specified,development of CMHs,longitudinal evaluation,False,"Model A's decision is correct.

Ilixadencel (allogeneic inflammatory dendritic cells) is a cell-based immune primer injected intratumorally that previously has been clinically investigated in metastatic renal cell carcinoma and hepatocellular carcinoma. METHODS: The trial was a single arm phase I trial assessing safety and efficacy of ilixadencel in subjects with progressing advanced/metastatic GIST despite ongoing treatment with second or later lines of tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI). Three patients were progressing while on sunitinib (second line), one on regorafenib (third line), and two on pazopanib (fourth line). TKI treatment was maintained throughout, while two intratumoral injections of ilixadencel (10 × 10(6) viable and HLA-DR expressing cells per dose) were administered. RESULTS: No severe adverse events were found to be related to ilixadencel administration. Four patients showed continued tumor progression at 3 months per RECIST 1.1 and Choi criteria. One patient (on third line regorafenib) had stable disease for 9 months and another patient (on second line sunitinib) had stable disease at end of study (12 months) as per RECIST 1.1. These two patients developed a partial response as per Choi criteria with a duration of 3 and 6 months, respectively. The median progression-free survival (PFS) was 4.0 months.

Despite curative surgical resection, high recurrence of HCC after surgery results in poor patient survival. To develop prognostic markers is therefore important for better prevention and therapy of recurrent HCC to improve patient outcomes. Deletion mutations over the pre-S1 and pre-S2 gene segments of hepatitis B virus (HBV) have been closely associated with recurrence of HCC after curative surgical resection. In this study, we applied a next-generation sequencing-based approach to further evaluate the association of pre-S deletion regions with HCC recurrence. We demonstrated that the pre-S2 deletion (nucleotide 1 to 54) was the most predominant deletion regions of pre-S gene in plasma of HBV-related HCC patients. Moreover, patients with the pre-S2 deletion (nucleotide 1 to 54) exhibited a significantly higher risk of HCC recurrence after curative surgical resection than those without. The pre-S2 deletion (nucleotide 1 to 54) in plasma represented a prognostic factor that independently predicted HCC recurrence with greater performance than other clinicopathological and viral factors.

Combined information from ct-miR-148a-3p and ct-miR140-5p, which we previously reported to identify trastuzumab-responsive patients, resulted in greater predictive capability over each other, with pCR of 54% (95%CI 25%-81%) and 0% (95%CI 0%-31%) in ct-miR-148a/ct-miR-140-5p high/present and low/absent, respectively. GO and KEGG analyses showed common enriched terms between the targets of these ct-miRNAs, including cell metabolism regulation, AMPK and MAPK signaling, and HCC progression. In conclusion, early modulated ct-miR-148-3p may inform on the functional processes underlying treatment response, integrate the information from already available predictive biomarkers, and identify patients likely to respond to single agent trastuzumab-based neoadjuvant therapy.",Di Cosimo S; Appierto V; Pizzamiglio S; Silvestri M; Baselga J; Piccart M; Huober J; Izquierdo M; de la Pena L; Hilbers FS; de Azambuja E; Untch M; Pusztai L; Pritchard K; Nuciforo P; Vincent-Salomon A; Symmans F; Apolone G; de Braud FG; Iorio MV; Verderio P; Daidone MG,False,Population and intervention do not match the target criteria.,patients with HER2-positive breast cancer,trastuzumab,not specified,pathological complete response,not specified,False,"Model A's decision is correct.

This study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of a clinical decision support system in postembolization syndrome management across nurses and patient outcomes. This study is a randomized controlled trial. We included 40 RNs and 51 hospitalized patients in the study. For nurses in the experimental group, a clinical decision support system and a handbook were provided for 6 weeks, and for nurses in the control group, only a handbook was provided. Notably, the experimental group exhibited statistically significant improvements in patient-centered caring attitude, pain management barrier identification, and comfort care competence after clinical decision support system implementation. Moreover, patients' symptom interference during the experimental period significantly decreased compared with before the intervention. This study offers insights into the potential of clinical decision support system in refining nursing practices and nurturing patient well-being, presenting prospects for advancing patient-centered care and nursing competence. The clinical decision support system contents, encompassing postembolization syndrome risk prediction and care recommendations, should underscore its role in fostering a patient-centered care attitude and bolster nurses' comfort care competence.",Kang M; Kim MS,False,Intervention and outcome do not match the target criteria.,patients with hepatocellular carcinoma,clinical decision support system,handbook only,nursing practices and patient outcomes,randomized controlled trial,False,"Model A's decision is correct.

313,Preoperative circulating tumor cells to predict microvascular invasion and dynamical detection indicate the prognosis of hepatocellular carcinoma.,10.1186/s12885-020-07488-8,"BACKGROUND: This study explored the diagnostic power of preoperative circulating tumor cells (CTCs) for the presence of microvascular invasion (MVI) and the relationship between dynamic changes in postoperative CTCs and prognosis. METHODS: A total of 137 patients were recruited for the study. Preoperative blood samples were collected from all patients to detect CTCs. The time points for blood collection were before the operation, during the operation, and at 1 week, 1 month, 2 months, 3 months, 6 months, and 1 year after surgery. The predictive power of CTC count for the presence of MVI was analyzed by receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis. According to recurrence status, 137 patients were divided into three groups: no recurrence, early recurrence, and non-early recurrence groups. RESULTS: A threshold CTC count of 5 showed the most significant power for predicting the existence of MVI. In multivariate analysis, the parameters of preoperative CTC count, alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) and tumor diameter were independent predictors of MVI (P <  0.05). A CTC count greater than or equal to 5 had better predictive value than AFP > 400 μg/L and tumor diameter > 5 cm. The number of intraoperative CTCs in the three groups did not increase compared to that before surgery (P > 0.05). The number of CTCs in the nonrecurrence group and the non-early recurrence group decreased significantly 1 week after surgery compared with the intraoperative values (P <  0.001), although there was no significant difference in the early recurrence group (P = 0.95). Patients with mean CTC count ≥5 had significantly worse long-term outcomes than those with mean CTC count < 5 (P <  0.001). CONCLUSION: The preoperative CTC counts in the peripheral blood of patients with HCC are closely correlated with MVI. The intraoperative manipulation of the lesion by the surgeon does not increase the number of CTCs in peripheral blood. Surgical removal of the tumor decreases the number of CTCs. The persistence of CTCs at a high level (≥ 5) after surgery suggests a risk of early recurrence.

Tumor-infiltrating CD8-positive (CD8+) T lymphocytes play a central role in antitumor immune responses. Noninvasive imaging of CD8+ T cells may provide new insights into the mechanisms of immunotherapy and potentially predict treatment response. We are studying the safety and utility of (89)Zr-IAB22M2C, a radiolabeled minibody against CD8+ T cells, for targeted imaging of CD8+ T cells in patients with cancer. Methods: The initial dose escalation phase of this first-in-humans prospective study included 6 patients (melanoma, 1; lung, 4; hepatocellular carcinoma, 1). Patients received approximately 111 MBq (3 mCi) of (89)Zr-IAB22M2C (at minibody mass doses of 0.2, 0.5, 1.0, 1.5, 5, or 10 mg) as a single dose, followed by PET/CT scans at approximately 1-2, 6-8, 24, 48, and 96-144 h after injection. Biodistribution in normal organs, lymph nodes, and lesions was evaluated. In addition, serum samples were obtained at approximately 5, 30, and 60 min and later at the times of imaging. Patients were monitored for safety during infusion and up to the last imaging time point. Results:(89)Zr-IAB22M2C infusion was well tolerated, with no immediate or delayed side effects observed after injection. Serum clearance was typically biexponential and dependent on the mass of minibody administered. Areas under the serum time-activity curve, normalized to administered activity, ranged from 1.3 h/L for 0.2 mg to 8.9 h/L for 10 mg. Biodistribution was dependent on the minibody mass administered. The highest uptake was always in spleen, followed by bone marrow. Liver uptake was more pronounced with higher minibody masses. Kidney uptake was typically low. Prominent uptake was seen in multiple normal lymph nodes as early as 2 h after injection, peaking by 24-48 h after injection. Uptake in tumor lesions was seen on imaging as early as 2 h after injection, with most (89)Zr-IAB22M2C-positive lesions detectable by 24 h. Lesions were visualized early in patients receiving treatment, with SUV ranging from 5.85 to 22.8 in 6 target lesions. Conclusion:(89)Zr-IAB22M2C imaging is safe and has favorable kinetics for early imaging. Biodistribution suggests successful targeting of CD8+ T-cell-rich tissues. The observed targeting of tumor lesions suggests this may be informative for CD8+ T-cell accumulation within tumors.

315,Decision-making based on 3D printed models in laparoscopic liver resections with intraoperative ultrasound: a prospective observational study.,10.1007/s00330-019-06511-2,"OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to evaluate impact of 3D printed models on decision-making in context of laparoscopic liver resections (LLR) performed with intraoperative ultrasound (IOUS) guidance. METHODS: Nineteen patients with liver malignances (74% were colorectal cancer metastases) were prospectively qualified for LLR or radiofrequency ablation in a single center from April 2017 to December 2018. Models were 3DP in all cases based on CT and facilitated optical visualization of tumors' relationships with portal and hepatic veins. Planned surgical extent and its changes were tracked after CT analysis and 3D model inspection, as well as intraoperatively using IOUS. RESULTS: Nineteen patients were included in the analysis. Information from either 3DP or IOUS led to changes in the planned surgical approach in 13/19 (68%) patients. In 5/19 (26%) patients, the 3DP model altered the plan of the surgery preoperatively. In 4/19 (21%) patients, 3DP independently changed the approach. In one patient, IOUS modified the plan post-3DP. In 8/19 (42%) patients, 3DP model did not change the approach, whereas IOUS did. In total, IOUS altered surgical plans in 9 (47%) cases. Most of those changes (6/9; 67%) were caused by detection of additional lesions not visible on CT and 3DP. CONCLUSIONS: 3DP can be helpful in planning complex and major LLRs and led to changes in surgical approach in 26.3% (5/19 patients) in our series. 3DP may serve as a useful adjunct to IOUS. KEY POINTS: • 3D printing can help in decision-making before major and complex resections in patients with liver cancer. • In 5/19 patients, 3D printed model altered surgical plan preoperatively. • Most surgical plan changes based on intraoperative ultrasonography were caused by detection of additional lesions not visible on CT and 3D model.",Witowski J; Budzyński A; Grochowska A; Ballard DH; Major P; Rubinkiewicz M; Złahoda-Huzior A; Popiela TJ; Wierdak M; Pędziwiatr M,False,Intervention and outcome do not match the target criteria.,patients with liver malignancies,3D printed models,not specified,decision-making in laparoscopic liver resections,prospective study,False,"Model A's decision is correct.

316,Transcutaneous Electrical Acustimulation Improves Gastrointestinal Disturbances Induced by Transcatheter Arterial Chemoembolization in Patients With Liver Cancers.,10.1111/ner.13158,"BACKGROUND: Gastrointestinal (GI) disturbances occur in patients who receive chemotherapy via transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (TACE) and could last for an extended period of time in some cases. Antiemetic drugs have a potential risk of developing hepatic failure and are ineffective for delayed nausea and emesis. Transcutaneous electrical acustimulation (TEA) has recently been reported to exert antiemetic and prokinetic effects, but it is unknown whether it has an ameliorating effect on TACE-induced GI disturbances. AIM: This study was designed to evaluate effects and mechanisms of noninvasive TEA on GI symptoms in patients treated with TACE. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Seventy-four patients with liver cancers (eighteen female; age 63.4 ± 1.1 years) scheduled for TACE were randomized to TEA (n = 37) or sham-TEA (n = 37). TEA was performed via acupoints, ST36 and PC6 using parameters previously optimized for GI motility (1 h, bid) from the postoperative day 0 (POD0) to POD2. Sham-TEA was performed using the same parameters via non-acupoints. Symptom questionnaires were completed daily. The electrogastrogram (EGG) and electrocardiogram (ECG) were recorded in the fasting state for 30 mins to assess gastric slow waves and autonomic functions, respectively, before and after the 3-day treatment. RESULTS: 1) In the acute phase (<24 h), TEA showed no effects on any of GI symptoms, compared with sham-TEA. 2) In the delayed phase (>24 h), TEA, compared with sham-TEA, decreased the percentage of patients who experienced nausea on POD3 (0% vs. 13.5%, p = 0.021), the nausea score on POD3 (p = 0.022), the anorexia score on POD2 (p = 0.040) and POD3 (p = 0.004), and the bloating score (POD1-3: p < 0.01). 3) In comparison with sham-TEA, TEA increased the number of spontaneous bowel movements (p = 0.001) and the Bristol score of the first stool (p = 0.014) and decreased the number of patients with the use of laxatives (p = 0.022). 4) Physiologically, the 3-day TEA but not sham-TEA increased the percentage of normal gastric slow waves (p < 0.001) and vagal activity (p = 0.006). The vagal activity was negatively correlated with the anorexia score (r = -0.267, p = 0.026). It was found that the sympathovagal ratio and tumor size>5 cm were independent risk factors predicting the occurrence of nausea in patients after TACE. CONCLUSION: TEA improves major TACE-induced GI disturbances in the delayed phase, including nausea, bloating, impaired gastric pace-making activity, and constipation in patients with liver cancers via the autonomic pathway.",Zhu Y; Li X; Ma J; Xu W; Li M; Gong Y; Zhang B; Chen Y; Chao S; Xu Q; Lin L; Chen JDZ,False,Intervention and outcome do not match the target criteria.,patients with liver cancers,transcutaneous electrical acustimulation,sham-TEA,GI symptoms,randomized controlled trial,False,"Model A's decision is correct.

317,Phase I Trial on Arterial Embolization with Hypoxia Activated Tirapazamine for Unresectable Hepatocellular Carcinoma.,10.2147/JHC.S304275,"BACKGROUND: Tirapazamine (TPZ) is a hypoxia activated drug that may be synergistic with transarterial embolization (TAE). The primary objective was to evaluate the safety of combining TPZ and TAE in patients with unresectable HCC and determine the optimal dose for Phase II. METHODS: This was a Phase 1 multicenter, open-label, non-randomized trial with a classic 3+3 dose escalation and an expansion cohort in patients with unresectable HCC, Child Pugh A, ECOG 0 or 1. Two initial cohorts consisted of I.V. administration of Tirapazamine followed by superselective TAE while the remaining three cohorts underwent intraarterial administration of Tirapazamine with superselective TAE. Safety and tolerability were assessed using NCI CTCAE 4.0 with clinical, imaging and laboratory examinations including pharmacokinetic (PK) analysis and an electrocardiogram 1 day pre-dose, at 1, 2, 4, 6, 10, and 24 hours post-TPZ infusion and an additional PK at 15- and 30-minutes post-TPZ. Tumor responses were evaluated using mRECIST criteria. RESULTS: Twenty-seven patients (mean [range] age of 66.4 [37-79] years) with unresectable HCC were enrolled between July 2015 and January 2018. Two patients were lost to follow-up. Mean tumor size was 6.53 cm ± 2.60 cm with a median of two lesions per patient. Dose limiting toxicity and maximum tolerated dose were not reached. The maximal TPZ dose was 10 mg/m(2) I.V. and 20 mg/m(2) I.A. One adverse event (AE) was reported in all patients with fatigue, decreased appetite or pain being most common. Grade 3-5 AE were hypertension and transient elevation of AST/ALT in 70.4% of patients. No serious AE were drug related. Sixty percent (95% CI=38.7-78.9) achieved complete response (CR), and 84% (95% CI=63.9-95.5) had complete and partial response per mRECIST for target lesions.

HPD was defined as at least two-fold increase in the tumor growth rate (TGR) during immunotherapy compared to TGR during the preimmunotherapy period. Overall, 47 patients were eligible for this analysis. HPD was observed in three patients (6%) with metastatic lung adenocarcinoma, metastatic urothelial transitional carcinoma, and metastatic hepatocellular carcinoma, respectively. These three patients showed a rapid clinical deterioration and survived less than 3.5 months from immunotherapy onset. Their chief preimmunotherapy characteristics were: age < 75 years, ≥2 metastatic sites, programmed death-ligand 1 < 50%, neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio > 3, and elevated lactate dehydrogenase.

Most patients (61%) had received five or more prior lines of therapy. No dose-limiting toxicities were reported and, hence, the maximum tolerated dose was 10 mg/kg or more. Pharmacokinetics in Japanese patients aligned with those reported in a global dose-escalation study. The safety profile was consistent with other approved anti-PD-1 mAbs; the most common drug-related adverse events were maculopapular rash (22%), followed by malaise and increased blood alkaline phosphatase (11% each). Partial responses were reported in two patients (11%), one with transitional cell carcinoma and the other with hepatocellular carcinoma.
