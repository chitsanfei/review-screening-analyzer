0,"Optimizing the Safe Washout Period for Liver Transplantation Following Immune Checkpoint Inhibitors with Atezolizumab, Nivolumab, or Pembrolizumab",10.1016/j.transproceed.2023.03.064,"Background. Using immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) as a downstaging therapy for liver transplantation (LT) has improved outcomes for patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). However, this therapy carries a risk of post-transplant graft rejection. The washout (WO) period between the last ICI dose and LT seems critical in preventing postoperative rejection. This study aimed to optimize the WO period by balancing tumor burden suppression and rejec-tion prevention using ICIs before LT.Methods. We reviewed published case reports or series from March 2020 to December 2022 regarding LT for HCC after downstaging or bridge therapy with ICIs and included 4 of our cases. Most patients received atezolizumab, nivolumab, or pembrolizumab; these ICIs shared a half-life of around 28 days. Therefore, we excluded cases without definite WO period data and those using non-atezolizumab/nivolumab/pembrolizumab ICIs and ultimately enrolled 22 patients for analysis. We compared their clinical outcomes and estimated the rejection-free survival for every 0.5 half-life interval.Results. Most study subjects received nivolumab (n = 25). Six patients had severe rejections (nivolumab group, n = 5) and needed rescue management. Of the 6 cases, 1 patient died after rejection, and 2 underwent re-transplantation. The median WO period in these 6 patients was 22 days (IQR: 9-35 days). In addition, we found that a 1.5 half-life (42 days) was the shortest safe WO period associated with significant rejection-free survival (P = .005).Conclusions. Our results showed that 42 days was the safest WO period before LT for HCC after ICI with atezolizumab, nivolumab, or pembrolizumab.","Kuo, FC; Chen, CY; Lin, NC; Liu, CS; Hsia, CY; Loong, CC",False,study design is not a randomized controlled trial,patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma,immune checkpoint inhibitors before liver transplantation,compared clinical outcomes based on washout periods,rejection-free survival rates,not specified,,,,,,,,,,
1,Immune checkpoint inhibitors in liver transplant recipients - a review of current literature,10.20517/2394-5079.2021.11,"Immuno-oncology, particularly with the development of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs), has become a frontline category of cancer-directed therapy, including in the treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). While liver transplant (LT) offers a potential cure for HCC, the use of ICIs is a topic of safety concern both pre- and posttransplant due to the risk of donor graft rejection. Nonetheless, some scenarios for which the therapeutic effects of ICI may be highly beneficial include the downstaging of unresectable HCC pre-transplant, or the treatment of recurrent HCC and secondary malignancies post-transplant. In this review, we explored the evidence surrounding the use of ICI in the peri-transplant setting, including safety and efficacy. In a comprehensive review of 28 cases of ICI use post-transplant, we found graft rejection in 9 of 28 cases (32%). Some factors that may increase the risk of rejection include younger age, less time between LT and ICI therapy, and PD-1/PD-L1 expression in the donor graft (particularly when using anti-PD-1/anti-PD-L1 ICIs). Despite these concerns, we relay a case of successful HCC downstaging with nivolumab and subsequent LT. We also describe several cases of response to ICIs post-LT (7 of 28 cases) among a group that is often heavily pre-treated. We conclude that ICIs are valuable options in the peritransplant setting that have demonstrated promising efficacy based on case reports. Controlled clinical trials are needed to further investigate the conditions that may allow safe delivery of these therapies.","Yin, C; Baba, T; He, AR; Smith, C",False,study design is not a randomized controlled trial,patients with hepatocellular carcinoma,immune checkpoint inhibitors in liver transplantation context,not specified,safety and efficacy related to graft rejection,"review of case reports, not a trial",,,,,,,,,,
2,Liver Transplantation for Hepatocellular Carcinoma in the Era of Immune Checkpoint Inhibitors,10.3390/cancers16132374,"Simple Summary Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) have witnessed significant success in systemic therapy of hepatocellular carcinoma, stimulating the transplant community to consider their use in the liver transplantation (LT) setting. This review provides an updated overview of the current evidence on ICI therapy before and after LT, discussing the associated pitfalls and remaining challenges. A particular focus is placed on the interactions between ICIs and immunosuppressive drugs, in order to identify predictive factors of good response, as well as critical aspects that should guide future research on the topic.Abstract Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remains the leading oncological indication for liver transplantation (LT), with evolving and broadened inclusion criteria. Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) gained a central role in systemic HCC treatment and showed potential in the peri-transplant setting as downstaging/bridging therapy before LT or as a treatment for HCC recurrence following LT. However, the antagonistic mechanisms of action between ICIs and immunosuppressive drugs pose significant challenges, particularly regarding the risk of acute rejection (AR). This review analyzes the main signaling pathways targeted by ICI therapies and summarizes current studies on ICI therapy before and after LT. The literature on this topic is limited and highly heterogeneous, precluding definitive evidence-based conclusions. The use of ICIs before LT appears promising, provided that a sufficient wash-out period is implemented. In contrast, the results of post-LT ICI therapy do not support its wide clinical application due to high AR rates and overall poor response to treatment. In the future, modern graft preservation techniques might support the selection of good ICI responders, but data from high-level studies are urgently needed.","De Stefano, N; Patrono, D; Colli, F; Rizza, G; Paraluppi, G; Romagnoli, R",False,study design is not a randomized controlled trial,patients with hepatocellular carcinoma,immune checkpoint inhibitors in peri-transplant setting,not specified,not specified,"review of current evidence, not a trial",,,,,,,,,,
3,"Treatment Strategy for Intermediate-Stage Hepatocellular Carcinoma: Transarterial Chemoembolization, Systemic Therapy, and Conversion Therapy",10.3390/cancers15061798,"Simple Summary Systemic therapy for advanced-stage hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is undergoing major changes owing to the advancements made in molecular-targeted therapies and immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs). Although transarterial chemoembolization has been used as the standard treatment for intermediate-stage HCC, it has recently included molecular-targeted drugs and ICIs. As intermediate-stage HCC encompasses a wide variety of HCCs, the appropriate regimen to be used and the order of drug administration, including the use of anti-angiogenic inhibitors, remain controversial. This review discusses treatment strategies for intermediate-stage HCC considering the background of progress in the treatment of advanced-stage HCC. Transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) has been standard treatment for intermediate-stage hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). However, all intermediate-stage HCC patients did not benefit from TACE treatment because intermediate-stage HCC encompasses a wide variety of HCCs. Owing to remarkable progress in systemic therapy, including molecular-targeted therapy for advanced-stage HCC, the standard treatment of HCC has recently shifted to systemic therapy. However, it remains controversial as to which treatment should be initially performed for intermediate-stage HCC. In addition, although curative treatment can be considered when the tumor shrinks, the timing of conversion therapy remains uncertain. This review summarizes the advances of HCC treatment and discusses treatment strategies for intermediate-stage HCC.","Hatanaka, T; Yata, Y; Naganuma, A; Kakizaki, S",False,study design is not a randomized controlled trial,patients with intermediate-stage hepatocellular carcinoma,immune checkpoint inhibitors and standard treatments,not specified,not specified,"review, not a trial",,,,,,,,,,
4,Immune Checkpoint Inhibitors in the Pre-Transplant Hepatocellular Carcinoma Setting: A Glimpse Beyond the Liver,10.3390/ijms252111676,"Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the most common primary liver cancer and the third leading cause of cancer-related death worldwide. Liver transplantation (LT) is the best therapy for most patients with non-metastatic HCC. In recent years, the management of patients with HCC has considerably changed, thanks to the improvement of molecular biology knowledge and the introduction of immunotherapy. To date, systemic therapy is authorized in the Western world only in patients with advanced HCC. However, this therapy could not only stabilize the tumour disease or improve survival but could display excellent response and lead to downstaging of the tumour that finally permits LT. There are increasing reports of patients that have performed LT after pretreatment with immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs). However, due to the intrinsic mechanism of ICIs, graft rejection might be favoured. In addition, chronic adverse effects affecting other organs may also appear after the end of therapy. This review aims to evaluate the readiness and outcomes of LT in patients with advanced HCC who have previously undergone treatment with ICIs. It seeks to identify the challenges, risks, and benefits associated with this conversion therapy. The integration of ICIs into the treatment paradigm for advanced HCC necessitates a nuanced approach to LT. While early evidence supports the feasibility of LT following ICIs therapy, there is an urgent need for standardized guidelines and more extensive longitudinal studies to optimize patient selection, timing, and post-transplant management.","Marzi, L; Mega, A; Turri, C; Gitto, S; Ferro, F; Spizzo, G",False,study design is not a randomized controlled trial,patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma,immune checkpoint inhibitors before liver transplantation,not specified,not specified,"review of literature, not a trial",,,,,,,,,,
5,Immunotherapy for transplantation of hepatocellular carcinoma: the next frontier in adjunctive therapy,10.1097/MOT.0000000000001133,"Purpose of reviewThe increasing success of liver transplantation in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) drives an ever-evolving search for innovative strategies to broaden eligible patients' pools. Recent advances in immuno-oncology have turned the spotlight on immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs). This review offers an updated overview of ICIs in liver transplantation for HCC, exploring neoadjuvant and adjuvant approaches and addressing unanswered questions on safety, patients' selection, and response predictors.Recent findingsICIs have transitioned from being a last-chance therapeutic hope to becoming an integral cornerstone in the treatment of advanced HCC, holding great promise as a compelling option not only to downstage patients for transplantation but also as an alternative strategy in addressing posttransplantation disease recurrence. Despite ongoing refinements in immunotherapeutic agents, the complex molecular pathways involved emphasize the need for a comprehensive approach to integrate immunotherapy in liver transplantation.SummaryInitial concerns about graft rejection, with ICIs as a bridging therapy to liver transplantation, were successfully addressed using adequate immunosuppressants strategies and minimized with a sufficient washout period. Post-liver transplantation disease recurrence remains challenging, requiring a balance between effective therapy and preserving graft function. Emphasis should be placed on clinical trials validating the risk-benefit ratio of ICIs for liver transplantation, guiding appropriate patients' selection, and establishing clear management pathways.","Tabrizian, P; Zeitlhoefler, M; Hassan, AT; Marino, R",False,does not describe a randomized controlled trial or specify outcomes,patients with hepatocellular carcinoma,immune checkpoint inhibitors in liver transplantation,not specified,not specified,review article,,,,,,,,,,
6,Immune checkpoint inhibitors in liver transplant: a case series,10.21037/jgo-22-922,"Background: Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) in the setting of liver transplant (LT) pose a risk of rejection and hold unclear benefit in both the neoadjuvant (pre-transplant) and post-transplant salvage setting. In the pre-transplant setting, neoadjuvant ICIs may serve as a bridge to LT by downstaging disease burden to fit within transplant criteria. Outcomes in this setting include patients who had successful transplants without complications to patients who suffered severe complications, including fatal hepatic necrosis and graft failure requiring re-transplant. Some authors suggest having a period of three months between checkpoint inhibition and transplant may help mitigate adverse effects. In the post-LT setting, there are few treatment options if there is a recurrence of disease, which forces treatment teams to reconsider checkpoint inhibitors. Again, a longer period of time between transplant and checkpoint inhibition may reduce risk of rejection. Case reports of patients treated with ICIs post-transplant utilized either nivolumab or pembrolizumab. As combination atezolizumab/bevacizumab is a relatively new treatment option for unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), there are only three reported cases using this combination in the post-LT setting. While there were no cases of rejection, all three cases had progression of disease. As immunotherapy joins transplantation as a mainstay of treatment for HCC, it remains unclear how to best navigate when the treatment course involves both immune activation and immunosuppression.Case Description: Patients who had an LT and were treated with ICIs (pre or post LT) at the University of Cincinnati were included in this retrospective chart review.Conclusions: Fatal rejection remains a significant risk even 4 years after LT. Neoadjuvant ICIs also pose a risk for acute cellular rejection; however, this may not always be clinically significant. Graft versus host disease (GVHD) may be an additional, previously unreported risk of ICIs in the setting of LT. Prospective studies are needed to understand benefits and risks of checkpoint inhibitors in the LT setting.","Rudolph, M; Shah, SA; Quillin, R; Lemon, K; Olowokure, O; Latif, T; Sohal, D",False,not a randomized controlled trial and lacks clear outcomes,patients with hepatocellular carcinoma undergoing liver transplant,immune checkpoint inhibitors,not specified,not specified,retrospective chart review,,,,,,,,,,

10,Liver Transplantation for Hepatocellular Carcinoma after Downstaging or Bridging Therapy with Immune Checkpoint Inhibitors,10.3390/cancers13246307,"Simple Summary Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) have revolutionized the treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). In addition to their role in advanced HCC, there is considerable interest in using ICIs in the neoadjuvant setting, either as a downstaging or bridging therapy, prior to potentially curative liver transplantation. In this article, we reviewed all the available literature on ICI use in this context. We postulate that ICIs may be utilized safely prior to liver transplant; however, further research is needed in this area. Liver transplantation offers excellent outcomes for patients with HCC. For those who initially present within the Milan criteria, bridging therapy is essential to control disease while awaiting liver transplant. For those who present beyond the Milan criteria, a liver transplant may still be considered following successful downstaging. Since the introduction of atezolizumab as part of the first-line treatment for HCC in 2020, there has been increasing interest in the use of ICIs as bridging or downstaging therapies prior to liver transplant. A total of six case reports/series have been published on this topic, with mixed outcomes. Overall, liver transplantation can be performed safely following prolonged ICI use, though ICIs may increase the risk of fulminant acute rejection early in the post-operative period. A minimal washout period between the last dose of ICI and liver transplantation has been identified as an important factor predicting transplant outcomes; however, further research is needed.","Gao, QM; Anwar, IJ; Abraham, N; Barbas, AS",False,does not specify a comparison group or study design,patients with hepatocellular carcinoma,immune checkpoint inhibitors,not specified,not specified,not specified,,,,,,,,,,

13,Prognostic Evaluation of Conversion Therapy following Hepatic Arterial Infusion Chemotherapy or Immunotherapy in Patients with Advanced or Transarterial Chemoembolization Unsuitable Intermediate-Stage Hepatocellular Carcinoma: A Retrospective Cohort Study,10.1159/000542291,"Introduction: Patients with advanced-stage or intermediate-stage hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) unsuitable for transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) had poor prognoses. Recent advancements in hepatic arterial infusion chemotherapy (HAIC) and immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) have demonstrated higher tumor response rates, which improved overall survival (OS). HAIC achieves an OS rate of approximately 14.5-15.3 months with a 39.1-42.5% tumor response rate. In comparison, ICIs have a 12-14 month OS rate with a 26-33% tumor response rate. Given these promising responses, this study evaluates the efficacy of conversion therapy with curative intent following HAIC or ICIs, focusing on survival outcomes. Methods: We retrospectively analyzed 80 patients with advanced or TACE-unsuitable intermediate HCC. Patients completed two HAIC or four ICI cycles, followed by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) criteria imaging. Based on demographics, cirrhosis status, Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer classification (BCLC) stage, treatment responses, and treatment modality, survival impacts were analyzed. OS was compared between HAIC and immunotherapy groups. The effect of conversion therapy with curative intent on survival outcomes was analyzed using a Cox regression model. Results: Among the 80 patients, 26 achieved positive response (CR/PR) with HAIC or ICIs, and 9 of them subsequently underwent conversion therapy with curative intent. Key prognostic factors included Child-Pugh stage B versus A (HR = 2.21, p = 0.041), BCLC stage C versus B (HR = 4.38, p = 0.011), and elevated alpha-fetoprotein levels (HR = 5.02, p < 0.001). Positive responders saw substantial survival benefits (HR = 0.26, p = 0.001). Patients undergoing conversion therapy exhibited significantly enhanced survival. Median OS was 13.58 months with standard therapy, while the curative intent surgery group did not reach the median OS (p = 0.002). For CR/PR patients, 48-month survival was 75.0% for the curative surgery group versus 38.0% for standard treatment.

To date, several ICIs have been approved by the FDA for advanced HCC in first-line or second-line therapy. Downstaging conversion therapy for potentially resectable HCC to provide opportunities for surgical intervention is challenging. ICIs have become a hot spot in this field due to their high response rate. However, HCC has various etiologies and can evade the immune system through multiple mechanisms, which limit the efficacy of ICI monotherapy and demand novel combination strategies. Radiation therapy (RT) is also a candidate for conversion therapy in HCC and is currently gaining increasing attention as a good combination partner with ICIs due to its ability to modulate the tumor microenvironment. In this review, we illustrate the current indications for ICIs and RT in HCC, the rationale for their synergistic combination, and the current clinical trials in combination therapy. We also speculate on predictive biomarkers and novel future strategies to further enhance the efficacy of this combination.

However, using this treatment strategy to convert initially unresectable HCC to resectable HCC was not reported. Methods: Consecutive patients with unresectable HCC who received first-line therapy with combined TKI/anti-PD-1 antibodies were analyzed. Tumor response and resectability were evaluated via imaging every 2 months (+/- 2 weeks) using RECIST v1.1. Resectability criteria were (1) R0 resection could be achieved with sufficient remnant liver volume and function; (2) intrahepatic lesions were evaluated as partial responses or stable disease for at least 2 months; (3) no severe or persistent adverse effects occurred; and (4) hepatectomy was not contraindicated. Results: Sixty-three consecutive patients were enrolled. Of them, 10 (15.9%) underwent R0 resection in 3.2 months (range: 2.4-8.3 months) after the initiation of combination therapy. At baseline, these 10 patients had a median largest tumor diameter of 9.3 cm, 7 had Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer stage C (vascular invasion) disease, 2 had stage B, and 1 had stage A. Before surgery, 6 patients were evaluated as a partial response, 3 stable disease, and 1 partial response in the intrahepatic lesion but a new metastatic lesion in the right adrenal gland.

16,Immunotherapy in liver transplantation for hepatocellular carcinoma: Pros and cons,10.4251/wjgo.v14.i1.163,"Liver transplantation (LT) has emerged as a curative strategy for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), but contributes to a higher predisposition to HCC recurrence in the immunosuppression context, especially for tumors beyond the Milan criteria. Although immunotherapy has dramatically improved survival for immunocompetent patients and has become the standard of care for a variety of tumors, including HCC, it is mainly used outside the scope of organ transplantation owing to potentially fatal allograft rejection. Nevertheless, accumulative evidence has expanded the therapeutic paradigms of immunotherapy for HCC, from downstaging or bridging management in the pretransplant setting to the salvage or adjuvant strategy in the posttransplant setting. Generally, immunotherapy mainly includes immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs), adoptive cell transfer (ACT) and vaccine therapy. ICIs, followed by ACT, have been most investigated in LT, with some promising results. Because of the complex tumor microenvironment and immunoreactivity when immunosuppressants are combined with immunotherapy, it is difficult to reach formulations for immunosuppressant adjustment and the optimal selection of immunotherapy as well as patients. In addition, the absence of effective biomarkers for identifying rejection and tumor response is still an unresolved barrier to successful clinical immunotherapy applications for LT. In this review, we comprehensively summarize the available evidence of immunotherapy used in LT that is specific to HCC. Moreover, we discuss clinically concerning issues regarding the concurrent goals of graft protection and antitumor response.","Luo, Y; Teng, F; Fu, H; Ding, GS",False,not a clinical trial and lacks outcome measurement specifics,patients with HCC undergoing liver transplantation,immunotherapy including ICIs,not specified,not specified,review article,,,,,,,,,,

18,Predictive factors for transition to conversion therapy in hepatocellular carcinoma using atezolizumab plus bevacizumab,10.1111/liv.15907,"Background: To identify predictive factors associated with successful transition to conversion therapy following combination therapy with atezolizumab and bevacizumab in the treatment of unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Methods: In total, 188 patients with HCC, who received atezolizumab plus bevacizumab combination therapy as the first-line chemotherapy, were studied. Patients who achieved complete response (CR) with systemic chemotherapy alone were excluded. Clinical factors possibly linked to successful transition to conversion therapy and the achievement of cancer-free status were identified. Results: Fifteen (8.0%) patients underwent conversion therapy. In the conversion group, there was a significantly higher proportion of patients with Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC) stage A or B (73.3% versus [vs.] 45.1%; p = .03) and tended to have lower Child-Pugh scores and alpha-fetoprotein levels. Multivariate analysis revealed that BCLC stage was a predictive factor for the implementation of conversion therapy (A or B; odds ratio 3.7 [95% CI: 1.1-13]; p = .04). Furthermore, 10 (66.7%) patients achieved cancer-free status and exhibited a smaller number of intrahepatic lesions at the start of treatment (3.5 vs. 7; p < .01), and a shorter interval between systemic chemotherapy induction and conversion therapy (131 vs. 404 days; p < .01). In addition, the rate of achieving cancer-free status by undergoing surgical resection or ablation therapy was significantly higher (p = .03). Conclusion: BCLC stage was the sole predictive factor for successful transition to conversion therapy when using combination therapy with atezolizumab and bevacizumab to treat HCC. Furthermore, a small number of intrahepatic lesions and early transition to conversion therapy were associated with the achievement of cancer-free status.","Kikuchi, T; Takeuchi, Y; Nouso, K; Kariyama, K; Kuwaki, K; Toshimori, J; Iwado, S; Moriya, A; Hagihara, H; Takabatake, H; Tada, T; Yasunaka, T; Sakata, M; Sue, M; Miyake, N; Adachi, T; Wada, N; Onishi, H; Shiraha, H; Takaki, A; Otsuka, M",False,lacks comparison and randomized controlled trial design,patients with unresectable HCC,atezolizumab plus bevacizumab,not specified,transition to conversion therapy and cancer-free status,not specified,,,,,,,,,,

The treatment groups were divided into Tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI), TKI plus loco-regional therapy (LRT), TKI plus anti-PD-1 therapy (TKI + PD-1), TKI + PD-1 + LRT, immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) plus LRT, and Atezolizumab plus bevacizumab (A + T) groups. The conversion to surgery rate (CSR), objective response rate (ORR), grade >= 3 treatment-related adverse events (AEs), overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) were analyzed.Results38 studies and 4,042 patients were included. The pooled CSR were 8% (95% CI, 5-12%) in TKI group, 13% (95% CI, 8-19%) in TKI + LRT group, 28% (95% CI, 19-37%) in TKI + PD-1 group, 33% (95% CI, 25-41%) in TKI + PD-1 + LRT group, 23% (95% CI, 1-46%) in ICI + LRT group, and 5% (95% CI, 3-8%) in A + T group, respectively. The pooled HR for OS (0.45, 95% CI, 0.35-0.60) and PFS (0.49, 95% CI, 0.35-0.70) favored survival benefit of conversion surgery.

20,Liver resection and transplantation in the era of checkpoint inhibitors,10.1016/j.jhepr.2024.101181,"Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) have revolutionised the treatment landscape for advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The combination of atezolizumab and bevacizumab has demonstrated efficacy, establishing a new standard of care for advanced HCC. Neoadjuvant studies have shown promising results with high response rates, increasing research into ICIs' role. In the perioperative setting, in addition to adjuvant and neo-adjuvant therapies, strategies for ""downstaging"" and ""bridging"" patients to liver transplantation (LT) are being investigated, broadening the eligible candidate pool. Furthermore, therapeutic advances have reshaped conversion strategies for hepatic resection, with emerging evidence indicating a role for adjuvant immunotherapy in patients at high risk of postoperative recurrence. In LT, concerns have arisen over the potential conflict between immunosuppression needs and the immune-enhancing effects of ICIs, with reports of severe rejection. However, liver-specific factors may lessen rejection risks, prompting exploration into the safety of pre-transplant ICI administration. Moreover, ongoing trials must prioritise patient selection and vigilant management protocols. Despite the remarkable progress in immunotherapy, the intricate molecular interactions within the tumour microenvironment and their implications on oncogenic pathways remain incompletely understood. This highlights the need for specialised expertise to effectively integrate immunotherapy into the surgical management of HCC. Key challenges include ensuring safety, optimising oncological outcomes, managing the risk of graft rejection in transplant recipients, and refining patient selection criteria. In this review, we aim to provide a comprehensive overview of the evolving role of immunotherapy in the surgical management of HCC, discussing the rationale for its application in both pre- and post-surgical contexts, leveraging current clinical experience, identifying potential limitations, and envisioning future applications. By integrating existing knowledge and highlighting areas for further investigation, this review seeks to inform clinical practice and guide future research endeavours. (c) 2024 The Author(s).

With the advent of immunotherapy, the combined use of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) has attracted great attention due to their potential effectiveness in advanced HCC. This study aims to compare the efficacy and safety of a triple therapy regimen (Interventional therapy, TKIs and ICIs, IT-TKI-ICI) with a dual therapy regimen (Interventional therapy and TKIs, IT-TKI) in the treatment of HCC and PVTT (HCC-PVTT).Methods A comprehensive search was carried out in PubMed, Web of Science, Embase, Scopus, and the Cochrane Library databases. Primary outcome measures were overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS), while secondary outcomes included tumor response rate, adverse event incidence as well as downstaging surgery rate. Statistical analysis was conducted using Revman 5.4 software.Results The meta-analysis finally included 6 cohort studies. The triple therapy group demonstrated significantly prolonged OS and PFS compared to the dual therapy group. Meanwhile, the former exhibited significantly higher rates of objective response rate (ORR), disease control rate (DCR) and better downstaging effects with a higher salvage surgery rate without significantly increasing adverse events.Conclusion In comparison to dual therapy, the triple therapy with interventional therapy, TKIs, and ICIs demonstrates superior efficacy and equivalent safety for HCC-PVTT.","Du, CJ; Wu, HY; Zhong, T; Zhai, QL; Yuan, JJ; Peng, JL; Ma, R; Li, JZ",False,study design is not a randomized controlled trial,patients with hepatocellular carcinoma and portal vein tumor thrombosis,triple therapy including immune checkpoint inhibitors,dual therapy without ICIs,overall survival and progression-free survival,not specified,,,,,,,,,,
22,Advances in systemic therapy leading to conversion surgery for advanced hepatocellular carcinoma,10.5582/bst.2024.01372,"Recently, a systemic therapy for advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) has been developed. The regimen for unresectable HCC varies and includes single or multi-tyrosine kinase inhibitors, monoclonal antibodies, immune checkpoint inhibitors, or their combinations. Treatment with these agents begins with sorafenib as the first-line drug for unresectable HCC. Subsequently, several systemic therapies, including lenvatinib, ramucirumab, cabozantinib, and regorafenib have been investigated and established. With advances in systemic therapy for unresectable HCC, the prognosis of patients with unresectable HCC has improved significantly than previously. Conversion surgery, consisting of systemic therapy and surgery, showed the possibility of improving the prognosis than systemic therapy alone. Although a combination of atezolizumab and bevacizumab is mostly used for initially unresectable HCC to conduct conversion surgery because of the high response rate and fewer adverse events compared to others, many trials are being conducted to assess their efficacy for initially unresectable HCC. However, the appropriate timing of surgery and interval between systemic therapy and surgery remain controversial. To address these issues, a multidisciplinary team can play a vital role in determining the strategies for treating unresectable HCC. This review describes previous and current trends in the treatment of HCC, with a particular focus on conversion surgery for initially unresectable HCC.","Hakoda, H; Ichida, A; Hasegawa, K",False,does not specify comparison or outcomes,patients with unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma,immune checkpoint inhibitors among other therapies,not specified,not specified,not specified,,,,,,,,,,

29,Safety and Survival Outcomes of Liver Resection following Triple Combination Conversion Therapy for Initially Unresectable Hepatocellular Carcinoma,10.3390/cancers15245878,"Simple Summary This study aimed to investigate the safety and long-term survival outcomes of salvage liver resection in patients with initially unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) who had undergone triple combination conversion therapy (TACE/HAIC + TKIs + ICIs). While hepatectomy following conversion therapy exhibited elevated incidence rates of intra-abdominal bleeding, biliary leakage, post-hepatectomy liver failure, and Clavien-Dindo grade IIIa complications compared to pure hepatectomy, their safety profiles remained acceptable when appropriate medical interventions were administered. Patients with initially unresectable HCC, who successfully underwent conversion resection, demonstrated comparable overall survival (OS) and recurrence-free survival (RFS) to patients with initially resectable HCC.Abstract Triple combination conversion therapy, involving transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (TACE) or hepatic arterial infusion chemotherapy (HAIC) combined with tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) and immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs), has shown an encouraging objective response rate (ORR) and successful conversion surgery rate in initially unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). However, the safety and long-term survival outcomes of subsequent liver resection after successful conversion still remain to be validated. From February 2019 to February 2023, 726 patients were enrolled in this retrospective study (75 patients received hepatectomy after conversion therapy [CLR group], and 651 patients underwent pure hepatectomy [LR group]). Propensity score matching (PSM) was used to balance the preoperative baseline characteristics. After PSM, 68 patients in the CLR group and 124 patients in the LR group were analyzed, and all the matching variables were well-balanced. Compared with the LR group, the CLR group experienced longer Pringle maneuver time, longer operation time, and longer hospital stays. In addition, the CLR group had significantly higher incidence rates of intra-abdominal bleeding, biliary leakage, post-hepatectomy liver failure (PHLF), and Clavien-Dindo grade IIIa complications than the LR group. There were no significant statistical differences in overall survival (OS) (hazard ratio [HR] 0.724; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.356-1.474; p = 0.374) and recurrence-free survival (RFS) (HR 1.249; 95% CI 0.807-1.934; p = 0.374) between the two groups.

30,Conversion therapy for massive hepatocellular carcinoma: A case report and literature review,10.1002/ccr3.7533,"Key Clinical MessageFor potentially resectable HCC, a more aggressive conversion therapy strategy (high-intensity combined with multiple treatment modalities) can be used. Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the sixth most common malignancy worldwide. The best treatment for HCC is radical surgical resection, but 70%-80% of patients are ineligible for surgery. Although conversion therapy is an established treatment strategy for various solid tumors, there is no uniform protocol for treating HCC. In this case, we present a 69-year-old male patient diagnosed with massive HCC with Barcelona clinical liver cancer (BCLC) stage B. Because of the insufficient volume of the future liver remnant, we believed radical surgical resection was temporarily impossible. Therefore, the patient received conversion therapy, including four cycles of transcatheter arterial embolization (TAE) and hepatic arterial infusion chemotherapy (HAIC-Folfox), lenvatinib (8 mg orally once a day), and tislelizumab (an anti-PD-1 antibody, 200 mg intravenously once every 3 weeks). Fortunately, the patient achieved a good treatment response (smaller lesions and improved liver function) and underwent radical surgery finally. There was no clinical evidence of recurrence at 6 months of follow-up. For potentially resectable HCC, this case reveals that a more aggressive conversion therapy strategy (high-intensity combined with multiple treatment modalities) can be used.","Zhou, ZY; Xu, XL; Sun, ML; Liu, Y; Liu, QY; Chen, CB; Yin, Y",False,does not meet randomized controlled trial requirement,69-year-old male patient with massive hepatocellular carcinoma,conversion therapy including anti-PD-1 antibody tislelizumab,not specified,good treatment response and no recurrence at follow-up,case report,,,,,,,,,,
31,Advanced hepatocellular carcinoma with response to lenvatinib after atezolizumab plus bevacizumab,10.1097/MD.0000000000027576,"Rationale: Various treatments are available for treating hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The immune checkpoint inhibitor combination of atezolizumab plus bevacizumab was recently approved for the treatment of unresectable HCC, but there are few reports on the failure of the combination treatment. Here, we present a case of unresectable HCC with adrenal metastasis that was eventually operated on after lenvatinib (LEN) treatment that followed failed treatment with atezolizumab plus bevacizumab. Patient concerns: A 68-year-old man was diagnosed with non-alcoholic steatohepatitis-based HCC with adrenal metastasis. Diagnosis: Cirrhosis was classified as Child-Pugh score of 5. HCC was diagnosed as Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer stage C. Interventions: We initiated treatment with atezolizumab plus bevacizumab. Liver dysfunction appeared 2 days after the first administration but was improved by intravenous rehydration and did not appear after the second course. The HCC shrank, but the adrenal metastasis grew bigger after the fourth course, so we changed the therapy to LEN. After HCC and adrenal metastasis were necrotic by LEN, conversion surgery was performed. Outcomes: After successful conversion therapy, the general condition of the patient was good, and has been carefully followed for 4 months to date without any evidence of further recurrences. Lessons: This case showed that even if atezolizumab plus bevacizumab is not effective, multidisciplinary treatment such as LEN and conversion surgery is possible. Given the efficacy of LEN after atezolizumab plus bevacizumab, it is important to consider that there is a possibility of cure even when first-line treatment is not effective for a patient with unresectable HCC.","Yano, S; Kawaoka, T; Johira, Y; Miura, R; Kosaka, M; Shirane, Y; Murakami, S; Amioka, K; Naruto, K; Ando, Y; Kosaka, Y; Yamaoka, K; Kodama, K; Uchikawa, S; Fujino, H; Ohno, A; Nakahara, T; Murakami, E; Okamoto, W; Yamauchi, M; Imamura, M; Mori, K; Arihiro, K; Kuroda, S; Kobayashi, T; Ohdan, H; Aikata, H",False,does not meet randomized controlled trial requirement,68-year-old man with unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma,atezolizumab plus bevacizumab,not specified,improvement in condition after subsequent treatment,case report,,,,,,,,,,
32,Pathologic assessment of hepatocellular carcinoma in the era of immunotherapy: a narrative review,10.21037/hbsn-22-527,"Background and Objective: Immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI)-based therapy has achieved impressive success in various cancer types. Several ICIs have been unprecedentedly approved as the treatment regimens for advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in recent decade. Meanwhile, numerous clinical trials are being performed to exploit more ICIs into initially unresectable HCC and postoperative HCC to expectantly induce adequate tumor downstaging for further resection or implement adjuvant treatment for relapse-free survival, respectively. In this review, we aim to summarize some pragmatic histomorphologic, immunohistochemical, and molecular pathologic parameters which promisingly indicate the response of neoadjuvant/conversion ICI-related therapy and predict the efficacy of adjuvant/therapeutic ICI-related therapy for HCC.Methods: We searched PubMed using the terms hepatocellular carcinoma, immunotherapy, immune checkpoint inhibitor, immune checkpoint blockade, conversion therapy, neoadjuvant therapy, adjuvant therapy, biomarker, pathologic evaluation, pathologic assessment till February 2023.Key Content and Findings: Although there is no consensus regarding the pathologic evaluation of relevant HCC specimens, it is encouraging that a few of studies have concentrated on this field, and moreover, the methods and parameters noted on other cancer types are also worthy of reference. For the pathologic assessment of HCC specimens underwent immunotherapy, a suitable sampling scheme, identifying immunotherapy-related pathologic response, and quantification of pathologic response rate should be emphasized. For the patients of HCC who are scheduled to receive immunotherapy, tumor-infiltrating lymphocyte, intratumoral tertiary lymphoid structure, programmed cell death ligand 1, Wnt/ beta-catenin, microsatellite instability and mismatch repair, tumor mutational burden and tumor neoantigen, as well as some other signaling pathways are the potential predictive biomarkers of treatment response of ICI.Conclusions: The management of HCC in the era of immunotherapy arises a brand-new pathological challenge that is to provide an immunotherapy-related diagnostic report. Albeit many related researches are preclinical or insufficient, they may tremendously alter the immunotherapy strategy of HCC in future.","Wang, H; Qian, YW; Dong, H; Cong, WM",False,does not meet randomized controlled trial requirement,patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma,various immune checkpoint inhibitors,not specified,not specified,review article,,,,,,,,,,
33,Efficacy of transarterial chemoembolization monotherapy or combination conversion therapy in unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma: A systematic review and meta-analysis,10.3389/fonc.2022.930868,"BackgroundHepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a highly malignant disease with poor prognosis, and most cases were already considered unresectable at the time of presentation. Conversion therapy, as an emerging treatment, is designed to provide patients with initially unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (uHCC) the opportunity to undergo radical resection. At present, conversion therapy for patients with uHCC remains controversial. Transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) is currently the most widely selected treatment for uHCC, but its efficacy as a conversion therapy remains controversial. MethodsWe compared and evaluated the conversion rate for and tumor response to TACE monotherapy or combination therapy. Meanwhile, postoperative complications and overall survival (OS) in uHCC patients who underwent conversion therapy were also analyzed. ResultsA total of 18 studies were included in this meta-analysis. The conversion rate for triple therapy [TACE in combination with tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) and immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs)] was 42% [95% confidence interval (CI), 0.29-0.56], higher than any other group [TACE monotherapy: 10% (95% CI, 0.08-0.12), bigeminy therapy: 19% (95% CI, 0.06-0.36)]. Meanwhile, triple therapy yielded a better tumor response than TACE monotherapy or bigeminy therapy. Among the patients with successful surgical resection after conversion therapy, the pooled postoperative OS rates at 1, 2, and 5 years were 90% (95% CI, 0.81-0.97), 58% (95% CI, 0.42-0.73), and 42% (95% CI, 0.26-0.60), respectively, and the major postoperative complications were biliary leakage (7%; 95% CI, 0.03-0.12) and liver failure (3%; 95% CI, 0.00-0.07).

Results: A total of 54 patients received standard systemic therapy comprising Bev combined with ICIs (Bev-ICIs group), 113 patients received direct surgery (Surgery group), and 273 patients received neoadjuvant therapy of TAT combined Bev plus ICIs, among which 79 patients (28.9%) underwent surgical resection after successful tumor downstaging (Neo-surgery group) while the remaining 194 patients (71.1%) received maintenance systemic therapies (Neo-maintenance group). Neoadjuvant following surgery demonstrated a prolonged OS in contrast to direct surgery, with a median OS time not reached in the Neo-surgery group and 30.6 (95% CI: 26.4-34.7) months in the Surgery group (hazard ratio (HR)=0.29, P=0.0058). The median PFS time in the Neo-surgery and Surgery groups stood at 19.2 (95% CI: 16.1-22.2) and 6.3 (95% CI:4.7-8) months, respectively (HR=0.25, P<0.0001). In patients failed to receiving resection after neoadjuvant therapy, the median OS was 22.8 (95% CI: 22.3-23.1) months, whereas that for the standard care population was 19.7 (95% CI: 15.9-24) month (HR=0.53, P=0.023). The median PFS time in Neo-maintenance group and Bev-ICIs groups was 11.2 (95% CI: 10.4-11.9) and 6.4 (95% CI: 4.4-8.5) months (HR=0.60, P=0.024). The ORR and disease control rate (DCR) across all patients received TAT-Bev-ICIs were 38.8% and 89.4%, respectively. Additionally, the pathological complete response (pCR) rate and the major pathological response (MPR) rate were 22.8% and 48.1% in the Neo-surgery group. As for safety, neoadjuvant therapy did not increase the perioperative complications when compared to direct surgery, and demonstrated similar incidences and severity of AEs when compared to the standard systemic therapy. Conclusion: The triple therapy regimen comprising TAT-Bev-ICIs emerged as a promising therapeutic strategy for locally advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) as a neoadjuvant intervention.","Yang, ZY; Wang, QY; Hu, L; Sima, X; Wang, JC; Hu, DD; Zhou, ZG; Chen, MS; Zhang, YJ; Fu, YZ",False,does not specify randomized controlled trial design,patients with locally advanced hepatocellular carcinoma,TAT combined with bevacizumab and ICIs,direct surgery and maintenance systemic therapies,overall survival and progression-free survival,not specified,,,,,,,,,,
35,"Lenvatinib plus anti-PD-1 antibodies as conversion therapy for patients with unresectable intermediate-advanced hepatocellular carcinoma: a single-arm, phase II trial",10.1136/jitc-2023-007366,"BackgroundOver 70% of the patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) are diagnosed at an advanced stage and lose the opportunity for radical surgery. Combination therapy of tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) and anti-programmed cell death protein-1 (PD-1) antibodies has achieved a high tumor response rate in both the first-line and second-line treatment of advanced HCC. However, few studies have prospectively evaluated whether TKIs plus anti-PD-1 antibodies could convert unresectable intermediate-advanced HCC into resectable disease.MethodsThis single-arm, phase II study enrolled systemic therapy-naive adult patients with unresectable Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer stage B or C HCC. Patients received oral lenvatinib one time per day plus intravenous anti-PD-1 agents every 3 weeks (one cycle). Tumor response and resectability were evaluated before the fourth cycle, then every two cycles. The primary endpoint was conversion success rate by investigator assessment. Secondary endpoints included objective response rate (ORR) by independent imaging review (IIR) assessment per modified RECIST (mRECIST) and Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors, V.1.1 (RECIST 1.1), progression-free survival (PFS) and 12-month recurrence-free survival (RFS) rate by IIR per mRECIST, R0 resection rate, overall survival (OS), and safety. Biomarkers were assessed as exploratory objectives.ResultsOf the 56 eligible patients enrolled, 53 (94.6%) had macrovascular invasion, and 16 (28.6%) had extrahepatic metastasis. The median follow-up was 23.5 months. The primary endpoint showed a conversion success rate of 55.4% (31/56). ORR was 53.6% per mRECIST and 44.6% per RECIST 1.1. Median PFS was 8.9 months, and median OS was 23.9 months. Among the 31 successful conversion patients, 21 underwent surgery with an R0 resection rate of 85.7%, a pathological complete response rate of 38.1%, and a 12-month RFS rate of 47.6%.

Recent studies of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) and antiangiogenic agents (AAAs) have shown encouraging results for unresectable HCC (uHCC). Here, we report a patient with uHCC who was treated with a combination of anlotinib and sintilimab (sintilimab 200 mg, intravenous glucose tolerance test, q21d and anlotinib 12 mg, orally, d1-14, q21d), an analog of the combination of lenvatinib and pembrolizumab with much lower cost. The patient with recurrent uHCC was downstaged to resectable disease by the combination therapy. After eight cycles of treatment with anlotinib and sintilimab, the patient underwent a second operation. The histology of the resected mass revealed a major and almost complete pathological response. However, this patient was diagnosed with type I diabetes mellitus with ketoacidosis after nearly 10 cycles of combination treatment with anlotinib and sintilimab. Active follow-ups revealed no signs of local recurrence or distant failure. In conclusion, this case report demonstrated that the combination of anlotinib and sintilimab, one of the strategies combining ICIs with AAAs, showed promising efficacy in the treatment of uHCC patients.","Fu, LL; Chen, P; Wang, SJ; Liu, WM; Chen, ZB; Chen, HB; Fu, ZM",False,not a randomized controlled trial and lacks a comparison group,patient with uHCC,anlotinib and sintilimab,not specified,major and almost complete pathological response,case report,,,,,,,,,,

This is a dual conversion therapy that combines surgery and oncology. Here, we report two cases of successful surgical completion after dual conversion therapy.CASE SUMMARYWe report that a 54-year-old man and a 69-year-old woman were diagnosed with primary HCC combined with hepatitis B cirrhosis (case 2 also combined with fatty liver) on physical examination. Due to the insufficient residual liver volume assessed before surgery, laparoscopic right PVL was performed, followed by HAIC combined with anti-PD-1 immunotherapy and TKI. Finally, surgical resection was successfully completed, and pathology confirmed that the tumor was mostly necrotic (90%) in one case, and no live tumor tissue was found in the other case.CONCLUSIONIn the process of surgical transformation, our treatment plan takes into account the control and transformation of oncology at the same time, which is expected to provide more opportunities for radical hepatectomy and improve the prognosis of patients with large liver cancer.","Gao, Q; Zhu, GZ; Han, CY; Ye, XP; Huang, HS; Mo, ST; Peng, T",False,not a randomized controlled trial and lacks a comparison group,patients with primary HCC and cirrhosis,HAIC combined with anti-PD-1 and TKI,not specified,successful surgical completion,case report,,,,,,,,,,

MethodsPatients with initially unresectable HCC who received combined lenvatinib and anti-PD-1 antibody between May 2020 and Jan 2022 in Zhongshan Hospital were retrospectively analyzed. Tumor response and resectability were assessed by imaging every two months according to RECIST version 1.1 and modified RECIST (mRECIST) criteria. ResultsA total of 107 patients were enrolled. 30 (28%) of them received conversion surgery within 90.5 (range: 53-456) days after the initiation of lenvatinib plus anti-PD-1 therapy. At baseline, the median largest tumor diameter of these 30 patients was 9.2 cm (range: 3.5-15.0 cm), 26 patients had Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer stage B-C, and 4 had stage A. Prior to surgery, all cases displayed tumor regression and 15 patients achieved objective response. Pathological complete response (pCR) was observed in 10 patients. No severe drug-related adverse events or surgical complications were observed. After a median follow-up of 16.5 months, 28 patients survived and 11 developed tumor recurrence. Survival analysis showed patients achieving tumor response before surgery or pCR had a longer tumor-free survival. Notably, patients with microvascular invasion (MVI) had significantly higher recurrence rate and poorer overall survival than patients without. ConclusionsLenvatinib combined with anti-PD-1 therapy represents a feasible conversion strategy for patients with initially unresectable HCC.

39,Recent updates in the use of pharmacological therapies for downstaging in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma,10.1080/14656566.2023.2229728,"IntroductionHepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the most frequent primary liver cancer, but only 20-30% of patients benefit from potentially curative treatments such as liver resection or transplantation. This article reviews conventional treatments and recent progress in pharmacotherapy for advanced HCC, with a focus on downstaging unresectable tumors to resectable status.Areas coveredIn this article, conventional treatments and recent progress in pharmacotherapy for advanced HCC, aiming at downstaging from unresectable to resectable status, are reviewed. Future prospectives of combination therapies using immune checkpoint inhibitors were also introduced by reviewing recent clinical trials, paying attention to the objective response rate as its potential of downstaging treatments.Expert opinionThe newly developed pharmacological therapies showed higher responses. Although various tumor statuses in advanced HCC hamper detailed analysis of successful conversion rate, the novel combined immunotherapies are expected to provide more opportunities for subsequent curative surgery for initially unresectable advanced HCC. The conversion treatment strategies for unresectable HCC should be separately discussed for 'technically resectable but oncologically unfavorable' HCC and metastatic or invasive HCC beyond curative surgical treatments. The optimal downstaging treatment strategy for advanced HCC is awaited. Elucidation of preoperatively available factors that predict successful downstaging will allow the tailoring of promising initial treatments leading to conversion surgery.","Takamoto, T; Maruki, Y; Kondo, S",False,not a randomized controlled trial and lacks a comparison group,patients with advanced HCC,combination therapies using ICIs,not specified,objective response rate for downstaging,review article,,,,,,,,,,
40,Two cases of hepatocellular carcinoma successfully treated by carbon ion radiotherapy after atezolizumab plus bevacizumab treatment,10.1007/s12328-023-01768-z,"We herein report two cases of huge hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) that were successfully treated by carbon ion radiotherapy after atezolizumab plus bevacizumab treatment. Case 1, an 84-year-old man, was diagnosed with HCC (maximum diameter: 11 cm) with portal invasion and presented HCC rupture. After obtaining hemostasis with transcatheter embolization, three cycles of atezolizumab-bevacizumab therapy were administered, and marked shrinkage of the HCC was confirmed. However, he developed jaundice, liver damage and cerebral subcortical hemorrhage. Thus, atezolizumab-bevacizumab therapy was discontinued. Total bilirubin, transaminase levels, and physical activity improved well with prednisolone, an antihypertensive agent, and rehabilitation. Thus, treatment with carbon ion radiotherapy (CIRT) was added, and the treatment effect at 4 months after CIRT was judged as a complete response (CR) according to the modified response evaluation criteria in solid tumors (mRECIST). Case 2, a 68-year-old man, was diagnosed with HCC (maximum diameter: 14 cm). Hepatic resection was difficult because the residual liver volume after treatment would be insufficient. Five cycles of atezolizumab-bevacizumab therapy were performed, and marked shrinkage of the HCC to a maximum diameter of 9 cm was confirmed. The treatment was converted to CIRT, and atezolizumab-bevacizumab therapy resumed one month after CIRT. The treatment effect at 3 months after CIRT was judged as CR according to mRECIST. Although conversion therapy after atezolizumab-bevacizumab therapy, including surgery and radiofrequency ablation, have been reported, CIRT may be a promising new tool for conversion therapy for HCC.","Takakusagi, S; Tanaka, H; Naganuma, A; Kakizaki, S; Shibuya, K; Ohno, T; Takagi, H; Uraoka, T",False,does not meet study design criteria,patients with hepatocellular carcinoma,atezolizumab plus bevacizumab therapy,not specified,not specified,case report,,,,,,,,,,
41,"Hepatectomy After Conversion Therapy with Hepatic Arterial Infusion Chemotherapy, Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitors and Anti-PD-1 Antibodies for Initially Unresectable Hepatocellular Carcinoma",10.2147/JHC.S432062,"Background: Most patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) are not candidates for liver resection. We investigated the clinicopathological characteristics and prognosis of patients with initially unresectable HCC who underwent hepatectomy after conversion therapy with hepatic arterial infusion chemotherapy (HAIC), tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), and anti-PD-1 antibodies. Materials and Methods: Patients with initially unresectable HCC who received HAIC combined with TKIs and anti-PD-1 antibodies followed by hepatectomy between December 2020 and December 2022, were retrospectively analyzed. Patient characteristics, tumor characteristics, treatment efficacy, perioperative characteristics, pathological characteristics, and survival outcomes were summarized and analyzed. Results: 67 patients were enrolled in this study. Patients were treated with 3 sessions (range:2-6 sessions) of combination therapy and were performed with hepatectomy in 4 months (range:1.4-17.8 months) after the initiation of the combination therapy. The median size of tumor shrinkage was 4.7 cm (range:0.9-11.7 cm). A pathological complete response (pCR) was achieved in 34.3% of the patients (n = 23). The median recurrence-free survival (RFS) was 19.3 months and the median overall survival (OS) was 28.7 months.

42,Changing the Treatment Paradigm for Hepatocellular Carcinoma Using Atezolizumab plus Bevacizumab Combination Therapy,10.3390/cancers13215475,"Atezolizumab plus bevacizumab combination therapy was approved worldwide for use in 2020. A 30% objective response rate with 8% complete response (CR) was achieved in a phase 3 IMbrave150 trial. Here, the change in the treatment strategy for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) using atezolizumab plus bevacizumab combination therapy is reviewed. The phase 3 IMbrave150 clinical trial was successful because of the direct antitumor effect of bevacizumab, which shifted the suppressive immune microenvironment to a responsive immune microenvironment, in addition to its synergistic effects when combined with atezolizumab. The analysis of CR cases was effective in patients with poor conditions, particularly tumor invasion in the main portal trunk (Vp4), making the combination therapy a breakthrough for HCC treatment. The response rate of the combination therapy was 44% against intermediate-stage HCC. Such a strong tumor-reduction effect paves the way for curative conversion (ABC conversion) therapy and, therefore, treatment strategies for intermediate-stage HCC may undergo a significant shift in the future. As these treatment strategies are effective in maintaining liver function, even in elderly patients, the transition frequency to second-line treatments could also be improved. These strategies may be effective against nonalcoholic steatohepatitis-related hepatocellular carcinoma and WNT/beta-catenin mutations to a certain degree.","Kudo, M",False,comparison not specified,patients with hepatocellular carcinoma,atezolizumab plus bevacizumab,not specified,30% objective response rate,phase 3 clinical trial,,,,,,,,,,
43,Criteria for identifying potentially resectable patients with initially oncologically unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma before treatment with lenvatinib plus an anti-PD-1 antibody,10.3389/fimmu.2022.1016736,"BackgroundConversion therapy is feasible in patients with oncologically unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). However, it is challenging to prospectively identify patients who are more likely to achieve successful conversion before initiating systemic therapy, either alone or combined with locoregional therapy. MethodsCriteria for identifying potentially resectable patients with initially oncologically unresectable HCC before treatment with lenvatinib plus an anti-PD-1 antibody were proposed based on real-world evidence. Multivariate Firth logistic regression was used to validate the proposed criteria in a retrospective cohort of consecutive patients with advanced HCC, who received combination therapy with lenvatinib plus an anti-PD-1 antibody between September 2018 and September 2021. ResultsThe proposed criteria were as follows: (1) Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0 or 1; (2) Child-Pugh class A; (3) intrahepatic tumors confined to one lobe (left, right, or middle lobe), or present in one lobe alongside a single tumor with diameter <= 5 cm or up to three tumors each with diameter <= 3 cm in the remaining lobes, with R0 resection achievable by hemihepatectomy, alone or combined with locoregional therapy to the remaining lobes during surgery; and (4) no portal vein tumor thrombus involving the contralateral liver lobe or reaching the superior mesenteric vein, no hepatic vein tumor thrombus involving more than two major hepatic vein branches on the tumor side, and no tumor thrombus of the inferior vena cava reaching the atrium. Firth logistic regression confirmed the criteria were an independent predictor of surgery following conversion therapy with lenvatinib plus an anti-PD-1 antibody. ConclusionsThis study proposed and validated criteria for identifying patients with initially oncologically unresectable HCC who are potentially resectable when treated with combination therapy with lenvatinib plus an anti-PD-1 antibody.

Combination regimens comprised of drugs with different mechanisms of action have shown better outcomes than single-drug or single-approach-based treatments; however, to date, combination regimens investigated as part of conversion therapy strategies have been two drug combinations with reported issues of relatively low surgical conversion and objective response rates. In this study, we investigated the efficacy and safety of triple combination therapy with angiogenesis inhibitors, programmed death-1 inhibitors and hepatic arterial infusion chemotherapy for surgical conversion of advanced HCC. MethodsThis was a single-center, retrospective, single-arm study of patients with unresectable HCC who received at least one cycle of triple combination therapy with an oral anti-angiogenic drug, programmed death-1 inhibitors and hepatic arterial infusion chemotherapy between August 2019 and August 2020. Endpoints included the overall response rate (ORR), surgical conversion rate, time to response and safety. Treatment response was assessed using the modified Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (mRECIST) and RECIST v1.1. ResultsIn total, 34 patients were included in this study, of whom 25 completed treatment evaluation. The best ORR was 96.0% (24/25); 48.0% (n = 12) had a complete response, 48.0% (n = 12) had a partial response, and 4.0% (n = 1) had stable disease.

45,"Conversion therapy for advanced hepatocellular carcinoma in the era of precision medicine: Current status, challenges and opportunities",10.1111/cas.16194,"Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), the most prevalent malignancy of the digestive tract, is characterized by a high mortality rate and poor prognosis, primarily due to its initial diagnosis at an advanced stage that precludes any surgical intervention. Recent advancements in systemic therapies have significantly improved oncological outcomes for intermediate and advanced-stage HCC, and the combination of locoregional and systemic therapies further facilitates tumor downstaging and increases the likelihood of surgical resectability for initially unresectable cases following conversion therapies. This shift toward high conversion rates with novel, multimodal treatment approaches has become a principal pathway for prolonged survival in patients with advanced HCC. However, the field of conversion therapy for HCC is marked by controversies, including the selection of potential surgical candidates, formulation of conversion therapy regimens, determination of optimal surgical timing, and application of adjuvant therapy post-surgery. Addressing these challenges and refining clinical protocols and research in HCC conversion therapy is essential for setting the groundwork for future advancements in treatment strategies and clinical research. This narrative review comprehensively summarizes the current strategies and clinical experiences in conversion therapy for advanced-stage HCC, emphasizing the unresolved issues and the path forward in the context of precision medicine. This work not only provides a comprehensive overview of the evolving landscape of treatment modalities for conversion therapy but also paves the way for future studies and innovations in this field.

46,Neoadjuvant atezolizumab plus bevacizumab prior liver transplantation for hepatocellular carcinoma,10.1016/j.jhepr.2024.101246,"Background & Aims: The combination of atezolizumab and bevacizumab offers a novel approach to immunomodulation, showing efficacy as a primary treatment in advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Concerns about graft safety and rejection have limited its exploration in the neoadjuvant setting of liver transplantation (LT). In this study, we investigate the clinical efficacy and the safety profile of pre-transplant administration of atezolizumab and bevacizumab for HCC. Methods: Herein, we performed a prospective assessment of 17 patients with HCC treated with neoadjuvant preoperative atezolizumab and bevacizumab prior to LT for HCC, obtained from December 2020 and December 2023 at seven Western transplant centers. Results: Among the 17 patients with HCC included in the study, 16 (94.1%) had a tumor burden outside of Milan criteria. Neoadjuvant locoregional therapies along with the administration of atezolizumab plus bevacizumab (median: 5 months; discontinued at least 4 weeks prior to LT) led to an objective response rate of 94% (complete response: 59%), downstaging to within Milan criteria (82%) and a pathological response at explant examination of 88%. Grade 3-4 treatment-related adverse events accounted for 17.6% of cases and were manageable. During the 25-month median follow-up period, two cases of mild (rejection activity index <= 4), biopsy-proven rejection were reported but no instances of severe allograft rejection or graft loss were reported. The 1-year and 3-year post-LT survival rates were 94.2% and 88.2%, respectively. Conclusions: This study highlights the favorable oncological and survival outcomes associated with atezolizumab and bevacizumab treatment in the pre-LT setting. This immune-based combination was safe in terms of treatment-related adverse events, and absence of severe post-transplant rejection or graft loss. These preliminary results could pave the way for expanding transplant eligibility criteria in patients at more advanced HCC stages. (c) 2024 The Authors.

47,"Pretransplant use of immune checkpoint inhibitors for hepatocellular carcinoma: A multicenter, retrospective cohort study",10.1016/j.ajt.2024.04.007,"Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) as a downstaging or bridging therapy for liver transplantation (LT) in hepatocellular carcinoma patients are rapidly increasing. However, the evidence about the feasibility and safety of pre-LT ICI therapy is limited and controversial. To this end, a multicenter, retrospective cohort study was conducted in 11 Chinese centers. The results showed that 83 recipients received pre-LT ICI therapy during the study period. The median post- LT follow-up was 8.1 (interquartile range 3.3-14.6) months. During the short follow-up, 23 (27.7%) recipients developed allograft rejection, and 7 of them (30.4%) were diagnosed by liver biopsy. Multivariate logistics regression analysis showed that the time interval between the last administration of ICI therapy and LT (TLAT) >= 30 days was an independent protective factor for allograft rejection (odds ratio = 0.096, 95% confidence interval 0.026-0.357; P <.001). Multivariate Cox analysis showed that allograft rejection was an independent risk factor for overall survival (hazard ratio = 9.960, 95% confidence interval 1.006-98.610; P =.043). We conclude that patients who receive a pre-LT ICI therapy with a TLAT shorter than 30 days have a much higher risk of allograft rejection than those with a TLAT longer than 30 days. The presence of rejection episodes might be associated with higher post-LT mortality.","Guo, ZY; Liu, Y; Ling, Q; Xu, LB; Wang, TL; Zhu, JX; Lin, YM; Lu, XJ; Qu, W; Zhang, F; Zhu, ZJ; Zhang, J; Jia, ZH; Zeng, P; Wang, WJ; Sun, Q; Luo, QJ; Hu, ZM; Zheng, ZY; Jia, YB; Li, J; Zheng, YJ; Wang, MC; Wang, SP; Han, ZM; Yu, S; Li, CJ; Zhang, SH; Xiong, J; Deng, FW; Liu, Y; Chen, HW; Wang, YF; Li, L; Liang, WJ; Schlegel, A; Nashan, B; Liu, C; Zheng, SS; He, XS",False,does not have a control group or specify ICIs used,recipients of liver transplantation with hepatocellular carcinoma,pre-LT immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy,not specified,overall survival,multicenter retrospective cohort study,,,,,,,,,,
48,Case report: Conversion therapy to permit resection of initially unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma,10.3389/fonc.2022.946693,"Most patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) are diagnosed when the disease is already at an advanced stage, so they are not eligible for resection and their prognosis is poor. The combination of transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) with immune checkpoint inhibitors or tyrosine kinase inhibitors can improve unresectable HCC to the point that patients can be treated with surgery. Here we describe two cases of such ""conversion therapy"". One patient was a 52-year-old man in Child-Pugh class A with treatment-naive HCC whose 11.3-cm tumor had invaded the middle hepatic vein and right branch of the portal vein. He was treated with TACE plus camrelizumab, and radical resection was performed 3 months later. No evidence of recurrence was observed during 5-month follow-up. The other patient was a 42-year-old man in Child-Pugh class A with HCC involving a 11.4-cm tumor and severe liver cirrhosis.

50,Utilization of Immunotherapy as a Neoadjuvant Therapy for Liver Transplant Recipients with Hepatocellular Carcinoma,10.3390/jcm13113068,"Background: Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is widely recognized as the predominant type of primary liver malignancy. Orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT) has emerged as a highly effective treatment option for unresectable HCC. Immunotherapies as neoadjuvant options are now being actively investigated in the transplant oncology era to enhance outcomes in patients with HCC. Here, we report our experience with patients with HCC who had received Immune Checkpoint Inhibitors (ICPI) prior to curative OLT. Methods: This was a retrospective cohort that included patients with HCC who received ICPI prior to OLT at a single institution from January 2019 to August 2023. Graft rejection was assessed and reported along with the type of ICPI, malignancy treated, and the timing of ICPI in association with OLT. Results: During this cohort period, six patients with HCC underwent OLT after neoadjuvant ICPI. All patients were male with a median age of 61 (interquartile range: 59-64) years at OLT. Etiology associated with HCC was viral (N = 4) or Non-alcoholic steatohepatitis, NASH (N = 2). Tumor focality was multifocal (N = 4) and unifocal (N = 2). Lymphovascular invasion was identified in four patients. No perineural invasion was identified in any of the patients. All patients received ICPI including atezolizumab/bevacizumab (N = 4), nivolumab/ipilimumab (N = 1), and nivolumab as monotherapy (N = 1). All patients received either single or combined liver-directed/locoregional therapy, including transarterial chemoembolization (TACE), Yttrium-90 (Y90), stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT), and radiofrequency ablation (RFA). The median washout period was 5 months. All patients responded to ICPI and achieved a safe and successful OLT. All patients received tacrolimus plus mycophenolate as immunosuppressant (IS) therapy post-OLT and one patient received prednisone as additional IS. No patient had clinical evidence of rejection. Conclusions: This cohort emphasizes the success of tumor downstaging by ICPI for OLT when employed as the neoadjuvant therapy strategy. In addition, this study illustrated the importance of timing for the administration of ICPI before OLT. Given the lack of conclusive evidence in this therapeutic area, we believe that our study lays the groundwork for prospective trials to further examine the impact of ICPI prior to OLT.","Abdelrahim, M; Esmail, A; Divatia, MK; Xu, JQ; Kodali, S; Victor, DW; Brombosz, E; Connor, AA; Saharia, A; Elaileh, A; Kaseb, AO; Ghobrial, RM",False,not a randomized controlled trial,patients with hepatocellular carcinoma,immune checkpoint inhibitors prior to liver transplantation,not specified,not specified,retrospective cohort study,,,,,,,,,,

54,Downstaging Hepatocellular Carcinoma with Checkpoint Inhibitor Therapy Improves Access to Curative Liver Transplant,10.1007/s12029-024-01040-8,"PurposeLiver transplantation is curative for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Checkpoint inhibitor therapy (CPIT) has been used in unresectable HCC, but recent advances have demonstrated CPIT as an innovative method of downstaging advanced HCC with the caveat that CPIT prior to transplantation has risks including irreversible graft rejection. We report the outcomes of Mayo Clinic Arizona patients who underwent downstaging with CPIT.MethodsThis retrospective chart review was conducted for Mayo Clinic Arizona patients who were diagnosed with HCC who underwent downstaging with CPIT with the goal of meeting criteria for transplantation.ResultsWe present nine cases with HCC outside Milan who underwent CPIT. Four received a transplant; one was delisted due to his exceptional therapeutic response. All received liver-directed therapy. Peak alpha-fetoprotein pre-CPIT ranged from 8-29,523 ng/mL, which decreased to 2.2-19.6 ng/mL on CPIT. CPIT included atezolizumab/bevacizumab, ipilimumab/nivolumab, nivolumab, and pembrolizumab; one patient received two regimens. CPIT was held prior to transplant at a median of 3 months. Three patients received methylprednisolone for immunosuppression induction; one received thymoglobulin. One patient developed acute cellular rejection at 5 weeks, 9 weeks, and 5 months post-transplant; given the late onset, these were not attributed to CPIT and were successfully treated. During an average follow-up of 16.5 months, no tumor recurrence has occurred.ConclusionWe describe nine patients with HCC outside Milan with inadequate response with liver-directed therapy, who achieved marked responses with CPIT, allowing for consideration of successful liver transplantation.

55,Liver-directed moderately hypo-fractionated radiotherapy combined with pembrolizumab and bevacizumab for advanced hepatocellular carcinoma: a retrospective observational study of 23 cases,10.21037/tcr-23-1333,"Background: Programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) or its ligand (PD-L1) monoclonal antibody combined with bevacizumab (a monoclonal antibody targeting vascular endothelial growth factor) has been established as first-line systemic treatment for advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Radiotherapy is a crucial local treatment for HCC. Mutual efficacy enhancement has been reported between radiotherapy, anti-angiogenesis therapy and immunotherapy in preclinical researches, but not been validated in clinical practice. Whether radiotherapy can enhance efficacy of anti-PD-1 immunotherapy plus bevacizumab for HCC remains unclear. This retrospective observational study aimed to appraise efficacy and safety of the combination of radiotherapy with pembrolizumab (a PD-1 monoclonal antibody) and bevacizumab for advanced HCC for the first time. Methods: Patients with advanced HCC treated by intrahepatic tumor-directed moderately hypofractionated radiotherapy combined with pembrolizumab and bevacizumab were consecutively included. Clinicopathological characteristics, therapeutic outcomes and treatment-related adverse events (TRAEs) were recorded and evaluated. Results: A total of 23 patients were eventually enrolled. Median cycles of pembrolizumab and bevacizumab were 4 (median, 1-8) and 4 (median, 1-9) cycles. The objective response rates and disease control rates of irradiated intrahepatic HCC and non-irradiated extrahepatic HCC were 34.8% [95% confidence interval (CI), 16.4-57.3%] vs. 10.0% (95% CI, 1.2-31.7%), and 91.3% (95% CI, 72.0-98.9%) vs. 70.0% (95% CI, 45.7-88.1%), respectively. The median progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) were 6.6 (95% CI, 4.7-8.5) and 18.3 (95% CI, 8.2-33.6) months, and 12-month PFS and OS rates were 17.5% (95% CI, 7.0-28.0%) and 60.9% (95% CI, 50.7-71.1%). Two patients (8.7%) with locally advanced, unresectable HCC eventually underwent curative resection of tumors after this trimodal treatment. Eighteen patients (78.3%) had >= grade 3 TRAEs, with myelosuppression and transaminase increase as the most common. Conclusions: This study firstly reported that combining radiotherapy with pembrolizumab and bevacizumab was preliminarily a feasible and effective therapeutic choice for advanced HCC in despite of more TRAEs. This tri -modal regimen may be a potential conversion therapy for unresectable, locally advanced HCC.

Methods: This retrospective study enrolled 156 patients who were Child-Pugh class A with u-HCC treated using Atez/Beva. The profile of objective response was investigated using decision-tree analysis. Progression-free, recurrence-free, and overall survival were assessed. Results: The progression-free and overall survival were 6.1 and 18.0 months, respectively. Objective response and disease control rates were 32.0% and 84.0%, respectively. Decision-tree analysis revealed that neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) <3, modified albumin-bilirubin grade (m-ALBI) 1 or 2a, and age < 75 were sequential splitting variables for the objective response, respectively. In the multivariate analysis, NLR <3 and m-ALBI grade 1 or 2a were identified as predictive factors for objective response. We successfully achieved eligibility for conversion therapy in 17 patients after Atez/Bev therapy significant response. Following conversion therapy, the curative therapy group, including surgical resection or radiofrequency ablation (RFA), had significantly higher recurrence-free survival than did the transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (TACE) and Atez/Bev discontinuation (surgical resection or RFA; not reached vs. TACE; 5.3 months, p = 0.008, Atez/Bev discontinuation; 3.9 months, p = 0.048, respectively) groups. Conclusions: NLR <3 and m-ALBI grade 1 or 2a were predictive factors for conversion therapy, leading to cancer- and drug-free states in patients with u-HCC undergoing Atez/Bev therapy.

57,Role of radiotherapy and its contribution to immunotherapy in hepatocellular carcinoma,10.21037/cco-23-50,"Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a major contributor to cancer-related deaths, with the incidence of HCC increasing in regions of the world with a high incidence of hepatitis B and C. The therapeutic landscape for HCC management has substantially transformed over recent years, shifting towards a multimodal treatment paradigm. This approach provides a range of medical and surgical interventions aimed at managing the disease effectively. Radiotherapy (RT) has surfaced as a critical player in the preoperative management of inoperable HCC, demonstrating potential in downstaging the disease and achieving disease stability. This advantage may potentially be attributed to the abscopal effect, where localized radiation leads to the regression of metastatic cancer outside of the irradiated site through upregulation of the immune system. The advent of recent technological breakthroughs has paved the way for innovative approaches, notably the integration of immunotherapy and RT. This strategy is emerging as a promising avenue for managing HCC. Preliminary findings from the fusion of RT and immunotherapy are encouraging, with ongoing trials keenly evaluating the optimal parameters for therapy administration, such as timing, dosage, and sequence. The development of combined treatments involving immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) has opened new avenues for advanced HCC treatment. Several immunotherapeutic agents with RT are concurrently being explored for their potential contributions to HCC management.","Nahm, WJ; Bhatt, A; Wu, JNF",False,abstract lacks sufficient information to meet criteria,not specified,combination of immunotherapy and radiotherapy,not specified,not specified,not specified,,,,,,,,,,
58,Therapeutic Management of Advanced Hepatocellular Carcinoma: An Updated Review,10.3390/cancers14102357,"Simple Summary Hepatocellular carcinoma is the fourth leading cause of cancer-related mortality worldwide and a major health problem. Overall survival is poor, with a five-year relative survival rate of 18.4% and only 2% in metastatic hepatocellular carcinoma. In 2020, the combination of atezolizumab and bevacizumab improved survival compared to sorafenib and was validated as the first-line treatment for advanced hepatocellular carcinoma. In case of disease progression, regorafenib and cabozantinib are recommended in the second-line setting. Transarterial chemoembolization can also be proposed for downstaging or in the palliative setting. Being able to reliably estimate liver function is a major issue in therapeutic management because patients with intermediate liver function are no longer eligible to receive systemic treatments. The aim of this review was to discuss systemic treatment management for patients with advanced unresectable HCC for whom liver-directed therapy is not appropriate. Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) usually occurs in the setting of liver cirrhosis and more rarely in a healthy liver. Its incidence has increased in the past years, especially in western countries with the rising prevalence of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. The prognosis of advanced HCC is low. In the first-line setting of advanced HCC, sorafenib, a tyrosine kinase inhibitor, was the only validated treatment for many years. In 2020, the combination of atezolizumab, an immune checkpoint inhibitor, and bevacizumab showed superiority to sorafenib alone in survival, making it the first-line recommended treatment. Regorafenib and lenvatinib, other multikinase inhibitors, were also validated in the second and first-line settings, respectively. Transarterial chemoembolization can be an alternative treatment for patients with intermediate-stage HCC and preserved liver function, including unresectable multinodular HCC without extrahepatic spread. The current challenge in advanced HCC lies in the selection of a patient for the optimal treatment, taking into account the underlying liver disease and liver function. Indeed, all trial patients present with a Child-Pugh score of A, and the optimal approach for other patients is still unclear. Furthermore, the combination of atezolizumab and bevacizumab should be considered in the absence of medical contraindication. Many trials testing immune checkpoint inhibitors in association with anti-angiogenic agents are ongoing, and primary results are promising. The landscape in advanced HCC management is undergoing profound change, and many challenges remain for optimal patient management in the years to come. This review aimed to provide an overview of current systemic treatment options for patients with advanced unresectable HCC who are not candidates for liver-directed therapy.","Puisieux, MF; Pellat, A; Assaf, A; Ginestet, C; Brezault, C; Dhooge, M; Soyer, P; Coriat, R",False,not a randomized controlled trial,patients with advanced unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma,atezolizumab and bevacizumab,compared to sorafenib,survival rates,not specified,,,,,,,,,,

62,Case Report: Transarterial Chemoembolization in Combination With Tislelizumab Downstages Unresectable Hepatocellular Carcinoma Followed by Radical Salvage Resection,10.3389/fonc.2021.667555,"Introduction Transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) is inefficient at converting unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (uHCC) to resectable. Treatment with immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) is an emerging strategy for uHCC. Combined therapy of TACE with ICIs is considered to improve the therapeutic effect. Case presentation A 45-year-old man was diagnosed with a bulky HCC under cirrhotic background without distant metastasis. Curative resection was infeasible, and TACE plus tislelizumab (an ICI targeting PD-1) was applied. The treatment course, starting from TACE and followed by tislelizumab one week later, was repeated every four weeks. After three courses, the tumor showed striking shrink in volume with complete radiological response, which permitted salvage resection. Notably, pathological examination found complete necrosis of the tumor with massive infiltration of lymphocytes in the tumor-nontumor interface and extensive granulomatous inflammation in the surrounding nontumor liver, indicating activated immune response synergistically caused by TACE with tislelizumab. The patient is now living well without tumor recurrence for 6 months after surgery. Conclusion TACE in combination with tislelizumab may represent a potent strategy for uHCC.

63,Association between tumor morphology and efficacy of atezolizumab plus bevacizumab for advanced hepatocellular carcinoma,10.1111/hepr.14024,"AimThe IMbrave150 trial revealed that atezolizumab plus bevacizumab (AtezoBv) showed a higher objective response rate (ORR) in patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Although conversion therapy after AtezoBv has been recently reported, markers predictive of its efficacy, particularly radiological imaging markers, have not yet been identified. The present study focused on tumor morphological appearance on radiological imaging and evaluated whether it could be associated with AtezoBv efficacy.MethodsNinety-five intrahepatic lesions in 74 patients who were given AtezoBv for advanced HCC were recruited for evaluation. The lesions were divided into two groups, simple nodular (SN group) and non-simple nodular (non-SN group), based on the gross morphology on pretreatment imaging, and retrospectively evaluated for treatment response and other relevant clinical outcomes.ResultsAssessing the size of individual tumors after treatment, waterfall plots showed that tumor shrinkage in the non-SN group including 56 lesions was higher than that in the SN group comprising 39 lesions. The ORR was significantly higher in the non-SN group (39.3% vs. 15.4%, p = 0.012). Additionally, the median time to nodular progression was longer in the non-SN group (21.0 months vs. 8.1 months, p = 0.119) compared to the SN group. Six patients with non-SN lesions underwent sequential local therapy.ConclusionsAtezolizumab plus bevacizumab may show increased therapeutic efficacy in patients with tumors with a higher potential for aggressive oncological behavior, such as non-SN lesions. Treatment strategies focusing on conversion therapy may be crucial in patients with non-SN lesions. This study showed that atezolizumab plus bevacizumab for hepatocellular carcinoma might be increasingly effective in patients with non-simple nodular (non-SN) intrahepatic lesions, which had a higher potential for aggressive features.

Various systemic chemotherapy drugs have been approved and are recommended by clinical guidelines worldwide. Although systemic treatments are effective and contribute to prolonged patient survival, their effects are unsatisfactory for some specific tumor conditions, such as macrovascular invasion. Hepatic arterial infusion chemotherapy (HAIC) is a traditional treatment for advanced HCC. As yet, there is no worldwide consensus recommending HAIC because no high-quality clinical trials have demonstrated its survival benefit. However, clinical evidence is gradually accumulating that shows its survival benefit, and it is recognized as an effective locoregional treatment for advanced HCC. Several HAIC regimens have been reported, including cisplatin monotherapy, cisplatin plus 5-fluorouracil (low-dose FP), lipiodol-suspended FP, and an oxaliplatin-based regimen. We have entered an era of chemo-diversity in the treatment of advanced HCC. This review aimed to clarify the relevance of HAIC in the era of chemo-diversity. We propose a multidisciplinary therapeutic strategy combining locoregional HAIC treatment with sequential drug therapy, with the aim of becoming cancer-free through conversion therapy.

67,A Case of Fibrolamellar Hepatocellular Carcinoma in Which Tumor Control Was Achieved by Re-Administering Atezolizumab and Bevacizumab,10.1002/cnr2.70090,"BackgroundFibrolamellar hepatocellular carcinoma (FL-HCC) clinically occurs in young people aged 20-30 years, who often have a normal liver background. We propose a treatment for such cases in which a combination therapy of atezolizumab and bevacizumab is followed by sandwiching radiation therapy to release tumor antigens and then re-administering the combination therapy of atezolizumab and bevacizumab (ABC conversion therapy).CaseThe patient is a 15-year-old girl. On April 18, 2022, she noticed skin yellowing and visited her local doctor. Computed tomography (CT) revealed a large mass in the right lobe of the liver and bile duct obstruction due to the tumor. She also had a nodule on her chest that appeared to be a metastatic tumor and was referred to Kinki University Hospital in April 2023. She was suspected to have FL-HCC based on contrast-enhanced ultrasound and CT scan results. There were findings suggestive of lung metastasis; however, she underwent a right hepatic lobectomy on May 17, 2023, considering the risk of liver failure and intra-abdominal bleeding due to the large liver tumor. A CT scan conducted on July 25, 2022, showing increased lung metastases, and she started atezolizumab/bevacizumab combination treatment on October 20, 2022. On March 15, 2023, multiple lung metastases and new intrahepatic lesions appeared, which was diagnosed as progressive disease (PD), and lenvatinib was discontinued. On November 17, 2023, radiation therapy (25 Gy/5 Fr) was administered to the lung and intrahepatic lesions to release tumor antigens, and on November 27, 2023, atezolizumab and bevacizumab combination treatment was resumed to control the tumor.ConclusionCombination therapy with atezolizumab, bevacizumab, and radiation therapy may be an option for the treatment of FL-HCC.","Hagiwara, S; Oda, I; Ueshima, K; Komeda, Y; Nishida, N; Yoshida, A; Yamamoto, T; Omaru, N; Matsubara, T; Kudo, M",False,not a randomized controlled trial and lacks comparison and outcome details,15-year-old girl with fibrolamellar hepatocellular carcinoma,combination therapy of atezolizumab and bevacizumab,not specified,not specified,case report,,,,,,,,,,
68,Clearance of Hepatitis C Virus following Immune Checkpoint Inhibitor Therapy for Hepatocellular Carcinoma: Case Report,10.1159/000539646,"Introduction: Patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) have limited treatment options in the context of decompensated cirrhosis. HCC occurs in patients with hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection and cirrhosis at 1-4% per year. Direct-acting antiviral (DAA) efficacy is decreased in the presence of HCC. We present a case where immunotherapy may have resulted in HCV clearance, when DAA therapy had been ineffective. We hypothesise that immune checkpoint inhibitors targeting the PD-1/PD-L1 pathway can reverse T-cell exhaustion and aid in the clearance of chronic HCV. Case Presentation: This case study describes a male in his 40 s identified by a re-engagement initiative for HCV, who had been unaware of his diagnosis. On further investigation he was found to have compensated for liver cirrhosis and HCC. He was treated with HCV DAA therapy (sofosbuvir/velpatasvir) and then systemic immunotherapy for HCC with atezolizumab and bevacizumab, in an attempt to downstage the disease. Hepatitis C therapy did not achieve sustained virological response, with viral relapse after the end of treatment. This, combined with ongoing alcohol use, resulted in hepatic decompensation and cessation of immunotherapy after the fifth cycle. The HCV RNA subsequently became undetectable without further DAA re-treatment. Conclusion: To our knowledge, this is the first case of HCV clearance after DAA relapse and the timing of this event after immunotherapy suggests a causal link. We hypothesise that this may be due to the reversal of antiviral T-cell exhaustion. This would therefore support further investigation into other chronic viral infections that create tumour associated with immunosuppressive microenvironments. (c) 2024 The Author(s). Published by S.

69,Lenvatinib-based treatment regimens in conversion therapy of unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma: A systematic review and meta-analysis,10.3892/ol.2024.14398,"Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a malignancy associated with high morbidity and mortality rates. Conversion therapy provides patients with unresectable HCC (uHCC) the opportunity to undergo radical treatment and achieve long-term survival. Despite accumulating evidence regarding the efficacy of conversion therapy, the optimal treatment approach for such therapy remains uncertain. Lenvatinib (LEN) has shown efficacy and tolerable rates of adverse events (AEs) when applied in combination with immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) or locoregional therapy (LRT) over the past decade. Therefore, the present meta-analysis was performed to systematically assess the safety and efficacy of LEN-based treatment regimens in conversion therapies for uHCC. Data on outcomes, including the conversion rate, objective response rate (ORR), disease control rate (DCR) and AE incidence in patients with uHCC, were collected. A systematic literature search was performed using MEDLINE, Embase, Web of Science and Cochrane Library databases, up to the date of September 1, 2023. In total, 16 studies, encompassing a total of 1,650 cases of uHCC, were included in the final meta-analysis. The pooled conversion rates for LEN alone, LEN + ICI, LEN + LRT and LEN + ICI + LRT were calculated to be 0.04 (95% CI, 0.00-0.07; I2=77%), 0.23 (95% CI, 0.16-0.30; I2=66%), 0.14 (95% CI, 0.10-0.18; I2=0%) and 0.35 (95% CI, 0.23-0.47; I2=88%), respectively. The pooled ORRs for LEN alone, LEN + ICI, LEN + LRT and LEN + ICI + LRT were found to be 0.45 (95% CI, 0.23-0.67; I2=96%), 0.49 (95% CI, 0.39-0.60; I2=78%), 0.43 (95% CI, 0.24-0.62; I2=88%) and 0.69 (95% CI, 0.56-0.82; I2=92%), respectively. The pooled DCRs for LEN alone, LEN + ICI, LEN + LRT and LEN + ICI + LRT were observed to be 0.77 (95% CI, 0.73-0.81; I2=23%), 0.82 (95% CI, 0.69-0.95; I2=90%), 0.67 (95% CI, 0.39-0.94; I2=94%) and 0.87 (95% CI, 0.82-0.93; I2=67%), respectively.

70,Hepatocellular Carcinoma: The Evolving Role of Systemic Therapies as a Bridging Treatment to Liver Transplantation,10.3390/cancers16112081,"Simple Summary Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a common cancer and a leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide. However, HCC can be effectively treated in selected cases, with liver transplantation representing one of the limited options for potential cure. Unfortunately, many patients are ineligible for liver transplantation either due to an advanced tumor at initial diagnosis or due to disease progression while awaiting liver transplantation. Our review discusses the role of systemic therapies as a bridging treatment to liver transplantation, thereby enabling more HCC patients to undergo potentially curative liver transplantation.Abstract Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the third most common cause of cancer-related deaths. Classically, liver transplantation (LT) can be curative for HCC tumors within the Milan criteria. Bridging strategies to reduce the dropouts from LT waiting lists and/or to downstage patients who are beyond the Milan criteria are widely utilized. We conducted a literature-based review to evaluate the role of systemic therapies as a bridging treatment to liver transplantation (LT) in HCC patients. Tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) can be used as a systemic bridging therapy to LT in patients with contraindications for locoregional liver-directed therapies. Immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) treatment can be utilized either as a monotherapy or as a combination therapy with bevacizumab or TKIs prior to LT. Acute rejection after liver transplantation is a concern in the context of ICI treatment. Thus, a safe ICI washout period before LT and cautious post-LT immunosuppression strategies are required to reduce post-LT rejections and to optimize clinical outcomes. Nevertheless, prospective clinical trials are needed to establish definitive conclusions about the utility of systemic therapy as a bridging modality prior to LT in HCC patients.","Saleh, Y; Abu Hejleh, T; Abdelrahim, M; Shamseddine, A; Chehade, L; Alawabdeh, T; Mohamad, I; Sammour, M; Turfa, R",False,not a randomized controlled trial,patients with hepatocellular carcinoma,immune checkpoint inhibitors as bridging therapy,not specified,not specified,literature-based review,,,,,,,,,,
71,Reassessment of palliative surgery in conversion therapy of previously unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma: Two case reports and review of literature,10.4240/wjgs.v16.i10.3312,"BACKGROUND Most patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) have lost the opportunity for direct surgery at the time of diagnosis. Transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) combined with immune checkpoint inhibitors or tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) can partially transform some unresectable HCC and improve the prognosis effectively. However, based on the promising prospects of combined targeted and immunotherapy for the effective treatment of HCC, the positive role of palliative surgery in the conversion treatment of advanced HCC urgently needs further intensive re-assessment. CASE SUMMARY In this study, we describe two successful cases of ""conversion therapy for unresectable HCC"" achieved mainly by palliative surgery combined with TACE plus immunotherapy and TKIs. A 48-year-old patient with newly diagnosed HCC, presenting with a 6-cm mass in the segment VII/VIII of the right liver with multiple intrahepatic metastases, could not undergo one-stage radical surgical resection. He underwent palliative surgery with radiofrequency of metastatic lesions and the palliative resection of the primary mass, and received subsequent TACE treatments twice in the early postoperative period (2 weeks and 6 weeks), in addition to targeted and immune combination therapy with sintilimab injection and oral lenvatinib. No evidence of recurrence was observed during the 11-month follow-up period after surgery. The other patient was a 47-year-old patient with massive HCC (18 cm x 15 cm x 4.5 cm) in the left liver with severe cirrhosis. The left portal branch was occluded and a tumor thrombus formed, and the tumor partly involved the middle hepatic vein. The patient underwent palliative surgery of left hemihepatectomy (including resection of the middle hepatic vein) for HCC, followed by three TACE procedures and oral TKIs 2 weeks after surgery. Six months later, the re-examination via computed tomography revealed no tumour activity in the remaining right liver, while magnetic resonance imaging revealed slight local tumor enhancement in the caudate lobe of the liver considered, TACE was performed once again, and during the next follow-up of 10 months did not reveal new intrahepatic lesions or distant metastases. CONCLUSION These cases demonstrate that the addition of palliative surgery to conversion therapy in a selected population with a high tumor burden could benefit patients with initially unresectable HCC.","Zhu, YB; Qin, JY; Zhang, TT; Zhang, WJ; Ling, Q",False,not a randomized controlled trial,patients with unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma,palliative surgery with TACE plus immune checkpoint inhibitors,not specified,improved prognosis,case report,,,,,,,,,,

The selection criteria of HCC for LT have evolved in recent decades. Down- staging therapy is a promising strategy for patients with tumor burden beyond transplant criteria to increase the chance of receiving LT and improve posttransplant survival. Downstaging therapy is also a selection tool that refines fi nes the conventional selection criteria based on tumor morphology. Recently, the success of systemic treatment, including immune checkpoint inhibitors, antiangiogenic tyrosine kinase inhibitors, and VEGF inhibitors, in advanced HCC has prompted the discussion regarding the role of systemic therapies for HCC downstaging before transplantation. In this review, we aimed to summarize the current advances in selection criteria and therapeutic options of downstaging therapy for HCC before LT.","Pang, L; Xu, LB; Wu, WR",False,not a randomized controlled trial,patients with hepatocellular carcinoma,systemic therapies including immune checkpoint inhibitors,not specified,not specified,review article,,,,,,,,,,
73,Resection of unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma after conversion therapy with apatinib and camrelizumab: a case report and literature review,10.3389/fonc.2024.1280805,"Hepatocellular carcinoma is a rather common malignant tumor. Most patients with hepatocellular carcinoma receive their diagnosis at an advanced stage, at which surgical resection is no longer appropriate. A growing body of research has demonstrated the value of convention therapy for patients with intermediate-stage hepatocellular carcinoma, while specific application protocols and treatment guidelines are not well developed. Emerging clinical researches suggest that a tyrosine kinase inhibitor in combination with an immune checkpoint inhibitor is a reasonable strategy for unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma. However, there are relatively few reports on the efficacy of apatinib and camrelizumab in the treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma. We were able to successfully remove one patient's hepatocellular carcinoma after 8 cycles of conversion therapy with apatinib (250 mg orally every day) and camrelizumab (200 mg intravenously every 2 weeks). The patient continued to receive the same dose of 16 cycles of apatinib and camrelizumab after hepatectomy. By the time of this study, the patient has completed 18 months of follow-up, and no tumor recurrence or metastasis was found in tumor markers and imaging examinations. Apatinib in combination with camrelizumab is an effective therapy for the treatment of advanced hepatocellular carcinoma, and surgical resection after this conversion therapy may provide patients with long-term oncological benefits.

They were converted successfully by the triple combination treatment and underwent or did not undergo salvage resection. The baseline characteristics, conversion schemes, conversion treatment-related adverse events (CTRAEs), overall survival (OS), and progression-free survival (PFS) of the salvage surgery and non-surgery groups were compared. Multivariate Cox regression analysis was performed to identify independent risk factors for OS and PFS. Additionally, subgroup survival analysis was conducted by stratification of degree of tumor response and type of PVTT.Results Of the 93 patients, 44 underwent salvage surgery, and 49 did not undergo salvage surgery. The OS and PFS of the salvage surgery and non-surgery groups were not significantly different (P = .370 and .334, respectively). The incidence and severity of CTRAEs of the 2 groups were also comparable. Subgroup analyses revealed that for patients with complete response (CR) or types III-IV PVTT, there was a trend toward better survival in patients who did not undergo salvage surgery. Multivariate analysis showed that baseline alpha-fetoprotein and best tumor response per mRECIST criteria were independent prognostic factors for OS and PFS.Conclusions For patients with initially unresectable HCC and PVTT who were successfully converted by the triple combination therapy, salvage liver resection may not be necessary, especially for the patients with CR or types III-IV PVTT.

New options for pre-transplant HCC management will expand access to this curative option as well as ensure patients have adequate control of their HCC prior to transplant to maximize the utility of a liver donor. Machine perfusion has been an active area of investigation in recent years and could expand the organ donor pool, helping address current liver donor shortages. Finally, additional HCC biomarkers such as AFP-L3 and DCP have shown promise in improving risk stratification of HCC patients.

83,Successful Liver Transplantation of Recurrent Fibrolamellar Carcinoma following Clinical and Pathologic Complete Response to Triple Immunochemotherapy: A Case Report,10.1159/000524872,"Introduction: Fibrolamellar carcinoma (FLC) is a rare liver cancer that predominantly affects younger patients without a history of liver disease. Surgical resection is the cornerstone of therapy and represents the best potentially curative treatment option. Modest objective responses with cytotoxic chemotherapy alone or combined with immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) have been reported; however, there are no established systemic therapy regimens for unresectable or metastatic FLC. Case Presentation: We report a case of a 23-year-old woman with FLC who presented with a 11.5 x 8.3 cm left liver mass and subsequently underwent resection as initial therapy. Molecular analysis of her surgical tissue revealed a DNAJB1-PRKACA fusion gene. The patient developed biopsy-proven recurrent FLC with multiple liver lesions but without any distant metastatic disease only 3 months after initial resection. In light of emerging data, the patient was treated with a novel triple therapy regimen including 5-fluorouracil (5-FU), interferon (IFN) alfa-2b, and nivolumab. Partial radiographic response was achieved after 4 treatments and complete response was achieved after 12 cycles with the combination. The patient received 2 more doses of 5-FU/IFN alfa-2b without nivolumab and underwent orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT) 6 months after the last dose of ICI. Pathological examination of the explanted liver remarkably confirmed pathologic complete response. She remains recurrence-free and is on active surveillance. Discussion/Conclusion: For patients with unresectable/recurrent FLC with no distant disease, the combination of 5-FU, IFN alfa-2b, and nivolumab could be an effective systemic therapy option. The use of this chemoimmunotherapy regimen to downstage FLC prior to OLT may be worth investigating further. (C) 2022 S.

Multivariate Cox regression analysis was employed to discern independent risk factors for postoperative recurrence-free survival (RFS).ResultsThe median operative duration was 200 min, with a median blood loss of 400 ml. Intraoperative blood transfusions were necessitated for 27 patients. The overall perioperative complication rate was 48.2%, with a major complication rate of 16.9%. One patient died during the perioperative period due to postoperative liver failure. During the median follow-up period of 15.1 months, 24 patients experienced recurrence, with early and intrahepatic recurrence being the most common. Seven patients died during follow-up. Median RFS was 25.4 months, with 1- and 2-year RFS rates of 68.2% and 61.8%, respectively. Median overall survival was not reached, with 1- and 2-year overall survival rates of 92.2% and 87.3%, respectively. Multivariate Cox regression analysis revealed that pathological complete response (pCR) and intraoperative blood transfusion served as independent prognostic determinants for postoperative RFS.ConclusionsOur study provides preliminary evidence suggesting that salvage liver resection may be an effective and feasible treatment option for patients with unresectable HCC who achieve resectability after conversion therapy with TACE, TKIs, and & alpha;-PD-1. The perioperative safety of salvage liver resection for these patients was manageable and acceptable. However, further research, particularly prospective comparative studies, is needed to better evaluate the potential benefits of salvage liver resection in this patient population.","Lin, KY; Lin, ZW; Chen, QJ; Luo, LP; Zhang, JX; Chen, JH; Wang, K; Tai, S; Zhang, ZB; Wang, SF; Zhang, JY; You, WY; Wang, B; You, PH; Lin, KC; Yang, T; Zeng, YY",False,does not include a comparison group or randomized controlled trial design,patients with unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma,"salvage liver resection after TACE, TKIs, and anti-PD-1",not specified,recurrence-free survival and overall survival rates,retrospective review,,,,,,,,,,
86,Achieving complete remission in metastatic hepatocellular carcinoma with sintilimab plus sorafenib therapy followed by hepatic resection: a case report,10.3389/fonc.2024.1355798,"Background The synergistic effectiveness of combining immune checkpoint inhibitors with targeted therapies has shown promise in improving the conversion rate for unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients to a potentially resectable status. However, the efficacy of this approach in the context of HCC with extrahepatic metastasis remains to be conclusively determined.Case presentation We report a rare case of advanced HCC with extrahepatic metastasis who achieved long-term survival by a combination of systemic therapy (sintilimab and sorafenib) followed by laparoscopic hepatectomy. A 63-year-old man presented at our hospital with discomfort on the right side of his waist. An enlarged right hepatic lobe mass was subsequently revealed by CT scan. The patient's medical history, including a prior infection with hepatitis B virus, cirrhosis of the liver and an alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) level measuring 41.28 ng/ml substantiated the clinical diagnosis of HCC. On October 30th, 2019, the patient received 200 mg sintilimab intravenously (q3w) plus 200-400 mg BID sorafenib orally, along with antiviral therapy. After six cycles, his disease achieved partial response (PR). On April 26th, 2021, He underwent a laparoscopic hepatectomy. The patient achieved a sustained period of no evidence of disease for 2.5 years and with drug-free survival for 2 years after the resection. His current overall survival is estimated at approximately 4 years.Conclusions This case highlights the potential of combining sintilimab and sorafenib in transforming HCC with extrahepatic metastasis into a condition amenable to surgical resection, suggesting that this treatment approach, followed by surgery, may lead to complete remission.","Cui, K; Li, ZC; Zhong, JT; Shi, XT; Zhao, L; Li, H; Ma, Y",False,not a clinical trial and lacks comparison group,advanced hepatocellular carcinoma with extrahepatic metastasis,sintilimab and sorafenib,not specified,long-term survival,case report,,,,,,,,,,
87,Neoadjuvant programmed cell death 1 inhibitor before liver transplantation for HCC is not associated with increased graft loss,10.1097/LVT.0000000000000083,"Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) may lead to rejection and even graft loss of solid organ transplant recipients, making them not widely used in transplant patients. There is insufficient clinical experience in using ICIs as a bridging or downstaging therapy before transplantation. We performed a retrospective review of patients receiving programmed cell death 1 inhibitor (PD1) before liver transplantation for HCC in our center and analyzed the data of these patients with the purpose of investigating the safety and feasibility of preoperative PD1 inhibitor among liver transplant recipients and exploring the preoperative correlation ICIs and the postoperative risk of rejection and immune-related graft loss. A total of 16 patients enrolled in this study. Acute rejection occurred in 9 patients, with an incidence of 56.3%. The median time of rejection was 7 days after surgery. The median FK506 concentration at the time of rejection was 7.1 mu g/L. All rejection reactions were reversed after adjusting the immunosuppression regimen. The interval between the last PD1 inhibitor and transplantation in the rejection group was shorter than that in the nonrejection group, and there was a statistical difference [21.0 (15.5-27.5) days vs. 60.0 (34.0-167.0) days, p=0.01]. In conclusion, PD1 inhibitor is a safe and feasible method for bridging or downstaging treatment before liver transplantation. Although preoperative PD1 inhibitor may increase the incidence of postoperative rejection, it is not associated with increased immune-related graft loss and patient death.","Wang, TL; Chen, ZT; Liu, Y; Jia, Y; Ju, WQ; Chen, MG; Zhao, Q; Wang, DP; Guo, ZY; Tang, YH; He, XS",False,not a randomized controlled trial and lacks a comparison group,liver transplant recipients with hepatocellular carcinoma,preoperative PD1 inhibitor therapy,not specified,"safety and feasibility, incidence of rejection",retrospective review,,,,,,,,,,
88,Outcomes of Salvage Surgery for Initially Unresectable Hepatocellular Carcinoma Converted by Transcatheter Arterial Chemoembolization Combined with Lenvatinib Plus Anti-PD-1 Antibodies: A Multicenter Retrospective Study,10.1159/000528356,"Introduction. The actual rate of conversion surgery and its prognostic advantages remain unclear. This study aimed to assess the outcomes of salvage surgery after conversion therapy with triple therapy (transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (TACE) combined with lenvatinib plus anti-PD-1 antibodies) in patients with initially unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (uHCC).Methods. Patients with initially uHCC who received at least one cycle of first-line triple therapy and salvage surgery at five major cancer centers in China were included. The primary endpoints were overall survival (OS) and recurrence-free survival (RFS) rates after salvage surgery. The secondary endpoints were perioperative complications, 90-day mortality, and pathological tumor response.Results. Between June 2018 and December 2021, 70 patients diagnosed with uHCC who underwent triple therapy and salvage surgery were analyzed: 39 with Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC) stage C, 22 with BCLC stage B, and 9 with BCLC stage A disease. The median interval between the start of triple therapy and salvage surgery was 4.3 months (range, 1.7-14.2 months). Pathological complete response and major pathological response were observed in 29 (41.4%) and 59 (84.3%) patients, respectively. There were two cases of perioperative mortality (4.3%) and five cases of severe perioperative complications (7.1%). With a median follow-up of 12.9 months after surgery (range, 0.3-36.8 months), the median OS and RFS were not reached. The 1- and 2-year OS rates were 97.1% and 94.4%, respectively, and the corresponding RFS rates were 68.9% and 54.4%, respectively.Conclusion. First-line combination of TACE, lenvatinib, and anti-PD-1 antibodies provides a better chance of conversion therapy in patients with initially uHCC. Furthermore, salvage surgery after conversion therapy is effective and safe and has the potential to provide excellent long-term survival benefits.","Wu, JY; Zhang, ZB; Zhou, JY; Ke, JP; Bai, YN; Chen, YF; Wu, JY; Zhou, SQ; Wang, SJ; Zeng, ZX; Li, YN; Qiu, FN; Li, B; Yan, ML",False,does not specify a comparison group or randomized controlled trial design,patients with initially unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma,"triple therapy with TACE, lenvatinib, and anti-PD-1",not specified,overall survival and recurrence-free survival rates,retrospective analysis,,,,,,,,,,

We aimed to investigate the activity of sequential transarterial chemoembolisation (TACE) and stereotactic body radiotherapy followed by avelumab (an anti-PD-L1 drug) for locally advanced, unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma. Methods START-FIT was a single-arm, phase 2 trial in patients with locally advanced hepatocellular carcinoma who were not suitable for curative treatment, conducted in two hospitals in Hong Kong and one in Shenzhen, China. Eligible patients were those aged 18 years or older with an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status 0-1, Child-Pugh liver function score A5 to B7, tumour size of at least 5 cm, a maximum of three tumour lesions, and adequate hepatic, renal, and bone marrow function. Participants received TACE on day 1, followed by stereotactic body radiotherapy (27 & BULL;5-40 & BULL;0 Gy in five fractions) at day 28. Avelumab (10 mg/kg) was administered 14 days following stereotactic body radiotherapy and every 2 weeks thereafter. The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients deemed amenable to curative treatment, defined as those who had a sustained complete or partial treatment response for at least 2 months and if curative treatment could be performed (ie, resection, radiofrequency ablation, or transplantation), analysed by intention to treat. Safety was also analysed in the intention-to-treat population. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT03817736) and has been completed. Findings Between March 18, 2019, and Jan 27, 2021, 33 patients (32 [97%] men and one [3%] woman) were enrolled. The median sum of the largest diameters of lesions was 15 & BULL;1 cm (IQR 8 & BULL;3-14 & BULL;9). 21 (64%) patients had macrovascular invasion (hepatic vein [n=13], branched portal vein [n=3], or both [n=5]). Median follow-up was 17 & BULL;2 months (IQR 7 & BULL;8-25 & BULL;8). 18 (55%) patients were deemed amenable to curative treatment: four (12%) of 33 patients had curative treatment (resection [n=2] or radiofrequency ablation [n=2]), and 14 (42%) had a radiological complete response and opted for close surveillance. 11 (33%) of 33 patients had treatment-related adverse events that were grade 3 or worse. The most common treatment-related grade 3 or worse adverse event was transient increase in alanine aminotransferase or aspartate aminotransferase (five [15%]) after TACE. Five (15%) patients developed immune-related adverse events of grade 3 or worse (three had hepatitis, two had dermatitis).

91,Cirrhosis and complications hepatocellular carcinoma - expanding indications for immunotherapy,10.1080/17843286.2025.2451429,"The incidence of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is rising, with a shift towards Metabolic Dysfunction-associated Steatotic Liver Disease becoming the dominant risk factor in Western countries. Significant advances in treatment have broadened the range of available therapeutic options. For this reason, clinical decision-making, along with a multidisciplinary team approach, plays a crucial role in improving patient outcomes. Following several landmark trials, immune checkpoint inhibitor-based therapy has now become the established first-line standard of care for advanced HCC. Additionally, the application of immunotherapy is shifting to include patients with earlier stages of HCC. Research on the combination with locoregional therapies for intermediate-stage HCC has recently reported positive results, and other phase III trials in the same patient population and early-stage HCC are currently in progress. Furthermore, a growing number of reports support the safety and efficacy of immunotherapeutic agents as potential adjuncts for downstaging of HCC, thus facilitating successful liver transplantation. We will discuss the published and ongoing trials in the expanding field of immune checkpoint inhibitor-based therapy for different stages of HCC.","Degroote, H",False,does not provide specific study design or comparison,patients with different stages of hepatocellular carcinoma,immune checkpoint inhibitor-based therapy,not specified,not specified,not specified,,,,,,,,,,

93,Organ specific responses to first-line lenvatinib plus anti-PD-1 antibodies in patients with unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma: a retrospective analysis,10.1186/s40364-021-00274-z,"Background We evaluated organ-specific response rates (OSRRs) to first-line lenvatinib plus anti-PD-1 antibodies in patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Methods This retrospective analysis included Chinese patients with unresectable/advanced HCC who received first-line lenvatinib (8 mg/day) plus >= 3 infusions of anti-PD-1 antibodies between October 2018 and May 2020. Tumor and macrovascular tumor thrombi (MVTT) treatment responses were evaluated every 2 months using RECIST v1.1. The overall response rate (ORR)/OSRR was defined as the percentage of patients with a best overall response of complete or partial response (CR or PR). Results In total, 60 patients were included in the analysis; 96.7% had measurable intrahepatic lesions, 55% had MVTT and 26.7% had extrahepatic disease. In all 60 patients, the ORR was 33.3%, median progression-free survival was 7.0 months (95% CI, 1.7-12.3) and median overall survival was not reached. The OSRR for MVTT (54.5%) was higher versus intrahepatic tumors (32.8%), extrahepatic lung metastases (37.5%) and lymph node metastases (33.3%). Among 33 patients with intrahepatic tumors and MVTT, 18 had differential responses in each site, including 13 with a better response in MVTT versus intrahepatic lesions. Among 18 patients whose MVTT achieved a radiographic CR or PR, six underwent surgical resection: 4/6 achieved a pathological CR in MVTT and 2/6 in the intrahepatic tumor. Conclusions First-line lenvatinib plus anti-PD-1 antibodies resulted in better tumor responses in MVTT versus intrahepatic lesions. Complete MVTT necrosis may allow downstaging and subsequent eligibility for surgical resection in a proportion of patients with advanced HCC.","Huang, C; Zhu, XD; Shen, YH; Wu, D; Ji, Y; Ge, NL; Chen, LL; Tan, CJ; Zhou, J; Fan, J; Sun, HC",False,no randomized controlled trial design or clear comparison,Chinese patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma,first-line lenvatinib plus anti-PD-1 antibodies,not specified,overall response rate and median overall survival,retrospective analysis,,,,,,,,,,
94,Efficacy of radiotherapy in combined treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma patients with portal vein tumor thrombus: a real-world study,10.1186/s12893-024-02334-1,"Background and aims Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) with portal vein tumor thrombus (PVTT) has an extremely poor prognosis. A previous study proved that low-dose radiotherapy (RT) could prolong the prognosis of HCC patients with PVTT. This study aims to explore the sensitivity of PVTT to RT treatment. Methods Patients were selected based on imaging diagnosis of HCC accompanied by PVTT and received combined treatment of radiotherapy, antiangiogenic drugs and immune checkpoint inhibitors, followed by hepatectomy or liver transplantation from January 2019 to August 2022. The efficacy was evaluated by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) guidelines and pathological assessment. The sensitivity of tumor cells to the treatment was compared between the primary tumor (PT)and PVTT by analyzing their residual tumor and pathologic complete remission (PCR) incidence. Results Data from 14 patients were collected in the study. After combined treatment, the size of PVTT decreased more significantly than that of the primary tumor in the imaging study (p < 0.05). The residual cancer was significantly more restrictive than that of primary tumor in paired patients based on pathological measurement (p = 0.008). The PCR incidence of the primary tumor (21.42%) was significantly lower (p = 0.008) than that of PVTT in the pathologic study (78.57%). Conclusion PVTT is more sensitive to radiotherapy treatment than the primary tumor in patients with HCC. This combination therapy might be an effective option as a downstaging therapy for patients with HCC with PVTT.","Xiao, Y; Li, KR; Zhao, Y; Yang, SZ; Yan, J; Xiang, CH; Zeng, JP; Lu, Q; Zhang, C; Li, G; Li, GX; Dong, JH",False,does not specify study design or comparison to a control,patients with hepatocellular carcinoma and portal vein tumor thrombus,"combined radiotherapy, antiangiogenic drugs, and immune checkpoint inhibitors",not specified,sensitivity of tumor cells to treatment,not specified,,,,,,,,,,
95,Outcome and management of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma who achieved a complete response to immunotherapy-based systemic therapy,10.1097/HEP.0000000000001163,"Background and Aims:The outcome of patients with HCC who achieved complete response (CR) to immune-checkpoint inhibitor (ICI)-based systemic therapies is unclear.Approach and Results:Retrospective study of patients with HCC who had CR according to modified Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (CR-mRECIST) to ICI-based systemic therapies from 28 centers in Asia, Europe, and the United States. Of 3933 patients with HCC treated with ICI-based noncurative systemic therapies, 174 (4.4%) achieved CR-mRECIST, and 97 (2.5%) had CR according to RECISTv1.1 (CR-RECISTv1.1) as well. The mean age of the total cohort (male, 85%; Barcelona-Clinic Liver Cancer-C, 70%) was 65.9 +/- 9.8 years. The majority (83%) received ICI-based combination therapies. Median follow-up was 32.2 (95% CI: 29.9-34.4) months. One- and 3-year overall survival rates were 98% and 86%. One- and 3-year recurrence-free survival rates were excellent in patients with CR-mRECIST-only and CR-RECISTv1.1 (78% and 55%; 70% and 42%). Among patients who discontinued ICIs for reasons other than recurrence, those who received immunotherapy for >= 6 months after the first mRECIST CR had a longer recurrence-free survival than those who discontinued immunotherapy earlier (p=0.008). Of 9 patients who underwent curative surgical conversion therapy, 8 (89%) had pathological CR (CR-RECISTv1.1, n= 2/2; CR-mRECIST-only, n= 6/7).Conclusions:Overall survival and recurrence-free survival of patients with CR-mRECIST-only and CR-RECISTv1.1 were excellent, and 6 of 7 patients with CR-mRECIST-only who underwent surgical conversion therapy had pathological CR. Despite potential limitations, these findings support the use of mRECIST in the context of immunotherapy for clinical decision-making.

Combination treatment with transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (TACE), lenvatinib, and anti-programmed death-1 (anti-PD-1) antibodies (triple therapy) has a high rate of tumor response and converted resection for initially unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (uHCC) patients. This study aimed to assess the outcomes of salvage surgery in uHCC patients after conversion therapy with triple therapy. Methods. uHCC patients who met the criteria for hepatectomy after receiving triple therapy as first-line treatment were eligible for inclusion in this study. The overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) rates in patients who received salvage surgery (SR group) and those who did not (non-SR group) were compared. Results. Of the 144 patients assessed, 91 patients underwent salvage surgery and 53 did not. The OS rates in the SR group were significantly better than those in the non-SR group. The 1- and 2-year OS rates in the SR group were 92.0% and 79.9%, respectively, whereas those in the non-SR group were 85.5% and 39.6 %, respectively (p = 0.007); however, there was no significant difference in the PFS rates. Upon further stratification, OS and PFS were significantly better in the SR group than in the non-SR group in patients who were assessed as partial responses (PR), while there was no significant difference in patients who were assessed as complete response (CR).

97,Conversion therapy for initially unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma: Current status and prospects,10.5582/bst.2023.01322,"Research has shown that locoregional and/or systemic treatments can reduce the tumor stage, enabling radical surgical resection in patients with initially unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma. This is referred to as conversion therapy. Patients who undergo conversion therapy followed by curative surgery experience a significant survival benefit compared to those who receive chemotherapy alone, those who are successfully downstaged with conversion therapy but not treated with surgery, or those who are treated with upfront surgery. Several treatments have been studied as conversion therapy. However, the success rate of conversion varies greatly, ranging from 0.8% to 60%. Combined locoregional plus systemic conversion therapy has demonstrated significant clinical advantages, with a conversion rate of up to 60%, an objective remission rate of 96% for patients, and a disease control rate of up to 100%. However, patients who underwent conversion therapy experienced significantly more complications than those who underwent direct LR without conversion therapy. Conversion therapy can cause hepatotoxicity, bone marrow suppression, local adhesions, increased fragility of blood vessels and liver tissues, and hepatic edema, which can increase the difficulty of surgery. In addition, criteria need to be established to evaluate the efficacy of conversion therapy and subsequent treatment. Further clinical evidence in this area is urgently needed.","Ma, YN; Jiang, XM; Liu, H; Song, PP; Tang, W",False,study design is not specified as randomized controlled trial,patients with initially unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma,conversion therapy,chemotherapy alone or direct surgery,survival benefit,not specified,,,,,,,,,,

This study aimed to assess the impact of addition of AtezolizumabBevacizumab (AtezoBev) on the outcome patients treated with SIRT. Methods: We conducted a study that included all Child-Pugh A HCC treated with SIRT since 2017. We examined the effects of the addition of 3 infusions of AtezoBev before the SIRT procedure and after SIRT on patients outcome (AtezoBev-SIRT group). Time-to-event data were analyzed using Kaplan-Meier with the log-rank test. Results: Thirty five HCC patients treated with SIRT were included, of whom 23 % also received AtezoBev infusions. The two groups were similar in terms of liver function and HCC parameters. The median OS was not reached for patients who received AtezoBev in combination with SIRT and 14 months for patients only treated by SIRT. The median PFS was higher in the group treated by SIRT and AtezoBev vs SIRT alone (11.3 months vs 5.8 months). In the global cohort, 8 patients presented a downstaging (23 %), 4 underwent liver surgery (1 in the AtezoBev-SIRT group) and 4 liver transplantation (1 in the AtezoBev-SIRT group) Conclusions: The administration of AtezoBev, both before and after SIRT, is associated with enhanced OS and PFS outcomes compared to SIRT alone for unresectable HCC.","Mejait, A; Roux, C; Soret, M; Larrey, E; Wagner, M; Bijot, JC; Lussey-Lepoutre, C; Thabut, D; Goumard, C; Maksud, P; Allaire, M",False,study design is not specified as randomized controlled trial,patients with hepatocellular carcinoma,Atezolizumab-Bevacizumab plus SIRT,SIRT alone,overall survival and progression-free survival,not specified,,,,,,,,,,

Integrated use of transarterial chemoembolization (TACE), a locoregional inducer of immunogenic cell death, with ICI has not been formally assessed for safety and efficacy outcomes. Methods From a retrospective multicenter dataset of 323 patients treated with ICI, we identified 31 patients who underwent >1 TACE 60 days before or concurrently, with nivolumab at a single center. We derived a propensity score-matched cohort of 104 patients based on Child-Pugh Score, portal vein thrombosis, extrahepatic metastasis and alpha fetoprotein (AFP) who received nivolumab monotherapy. We described overall survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS), objective responses according to modified RECIST criteria and safety in the multimodal arm in comparison to monotherapy. Results Over a median follow-up of 9.3 (IQR 4.0-16.4) months, patients undergoing multimodal immunotherapy with TACE achieved a significantly longer median (95% CI) PFS of 8.8 (6.2-23.2) vs 3.7 (2.7-5.4) months (log-rank 0.15, p<0.01) in the monotherapy group. Multimodal immunotherapy with TACE demonstrated a numerically longer OS compared with ICI monotherapy with a median 35.1 (16.1-Not Evaluable) vs 16.6 (15.7-32.6) months (log-rank 0.41, p=0.12). In the multimodal treatment group, there were three (10%) grade 3 or higher adverse events (AEs) attributed to immunotherapy compared with seven (6.7%) in the matched ICI monotherapy arm. There were no AEs grade 3 or higher attributed to TACE in the multimodal treatment arm. At 3 months following each TACE in the multimodal arm, there was an overall objective response rate of 84%. There were no significant changes in liver functional reserve 1 month following each TACE. Four patients undergoing multimodal treatment were successfully bridged to transplant. Conclusions TACE can be safely integrated with programmed cell death 1 blockade and may lead to a significant delay in tumor progression and disease downstaging in selected patients.","Marinelli, B; Kim, E; D'Alessio, A; Cedillo, M; Sinha, I; Debnath, N; Kudo, M; Nishida, N; Saeed, A; Hildebrand, H; Kaseb, AO; Abugabal, YI; Pillai, A; Huang, YH; Khan, U; Muzaffar, M; Naqash, AR; Patel, R; Fischman, A; Bishay, V; Bettinger, D; Sung, M; Ang, C; Schwartz, M; Pinato, DJ; Marron, T",False,does not meet randomized controlled trial design requirement,patients treated with immune checkpoint inhibitors,TACE plus nivolumab,nivolumab monotherapy,overall survival and progression-free survival,retrospective multicenter study,,,,,,,,,,

Radiographic response was evaluated using mRECIST. A pCR was defined as no viable tumor cells in resected samples.ResultsWe included 35 eligible patients, of whom 15 (42.9%) achieved pCR after systemic therapy. After a median follow-up of 13.2 months, tumors recurred in 8 non-pCR and 1 pCR patient. Before resection, there were 6 complete responses, 24 partial responses, 4 stable disease cases, and 1 progressive disease case, per mRECIST. Predicting pCR by radiographic response yielded an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.727 (95% CI: 0.558-0.902), with an optimal cutoff value of 80% reduction in the enhanced area in MRI (called major radiographic response), which had a 66.7% sensitivity, 85.0% specificity, and a 77.1% diagnostic accuracy. When radiographic response was combined with alpha-fetoprotein response, the AUC was 0.926 (95% CI: 0.785-0.999); the optimal cutoff value was 0.446, which had a 91.7% sensitivity, 84.6%, specificity, and an 88.0% diagnostic accuracy.ConclusionsIn patients with unresectable HCC receiving combined TKI/anti-PD 1 therapy, major radiographic response alone or combined with alpha-fetoprotein response may predict pCR.","Huang, C; Zhu, XD; Shen, YH; Xu, B; Wu, D; Ji, Y; Chen, LL; Song, TQ; Zhang, W; Zeng, ZM; Huang, HS; Wang, K; Huang, LQ; Chen, YJ; Yang, YC; Zhou, LD; Long, G; Zhao, HT; Wang, YC; Ge, NL; Chen, Y; Tan, CJ; Zhou, J; Fan, J; Sun, HC",False,does not meet comparison criteria,patients with unresectable HCC,combined TKI and anti-PD-1 therapy,not specified,radiographic response and pCR rates,retrospective study,,,,,,,,,,

In HCC, IT has become the leading systemic therapy for advanced diseases. At the same time, it carries the promise of being a valuable therapy in other settings, including intermediate-stage and unresectable disease, as a downstaging or conversion modality. More controversial is the role of IT in relationship to liver transplantation (LT): on one side, it could be a helpful tool to control or downstage HCC before LT or to treat tumor recurrence after LT, while on the other, it carries the risk of graft rejection and graft loss. This review aims to cover these concerns in depth and unravel the current literature.","Sensi, B; Angelico, R; Toti, L; Conte, L; Coppola, A; Tisone, G; Manzia, TM",False,not a clinical trial and lacks specific intervention and outcome data,patients with hepatocellular carcinoma,not specified,not specified,not specified,review article,,,,,,,,,,
102,Exploring the Evolving Landscape of Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy in Hepatocellular Carcinoma,10.1016/j.jceh.2024.102386,"Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) carries significant morbidity and mortality. Management of the HCC requires a multidisciplinary approach. Surgical resection and liver transplantation are the gold standard options for the appropriate settings. Stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) has emerged as a promising treatment modality in managing HCC; its use is more studied and well-established in advanced HCC (aHCC). Current clinical guidelines universally endorse SBRT as a viable alternative to radiofrequency ablation (RFA), transarterial chemoembolisation (TACE), and transarterial radioembolisation (TARE), a recommendation substantiated by literature demonstrating comparable efficacy among these modalities. In early-stage HCC, SBRT primarily manages unresectable tumours unsuitable for ablative procedures such as microwave ablation and RFA. SBRT has been incorporated as a modality to downstage tumours or as a bridge to transplant. In the case of intermediate or advanced HCC, SBRT offers excellent results either as a single modality or adjunct to other locoregional modalities such as TACE/TARE. Recent data from late-stage HCC patients illustrate the effectiveness of SBRT in achieving local tumour control while minimising damage to surrounding healthy liver tissue. It has promising local control of approximately 80-90% in managing HCC. Additional prospective data comparing the efficacy of SBRT with the first-line recommended therapies such as RFA, TACE, and surgery are essential. The standard of care for patients with advanced/metastatic disease is systemic therapy (immunotherapy/tyrosine kinase inhibitors). SBRT, in combination with immune-checkpoint inhibitors, has an immune-modulatory effect that results in a synergistic effect. Recent findings indicate that the combination of immunotherapy and SBRT in HCC is well-tolerated and exhibits synergistic effects. Further exploration of diverse immunotherapy and radiotherapy strategies is essential to identify the appropriate time for combination treatments and to optimise dose and fraction regimens. Prospective, randomised studies are imperative to establish SBRT as the primary treatment for HCC.","Sharma, D; Khosla, D; Meena, BL; Yadav, HP; Kapoor, R",False,not a randomized controlled trial and lacks specific outcome data,patients with advanced HCC,SBRT and immune-checkpoint inhibitors,"compared to RFA, TACE, and surgery",local control rates,not specified,,,,,,,,,,

Methods Between February 2014 and October 2022, 2338 patients with HCC who underwent initial IATs were consecutively enrolled. These patients were divided into training datasets (TD, n = 1700), internal validation datasets (ITD, n = 428), and external validation datasets (ETD, n = 200). Five-years death was used to predict outcome. Thirty-four clinical information were input and five supervised machine learning (ML) algorithms, including eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), Categorical Gradient Boosting (CatBoost), Gradient Boosting Decision Tree (GBDT), Light Gradient Boosting Machine (LGBT), and Random Forest (RF), were compared using the areas under the receiver operating characteristic (AUC) with DeLong test. The variables with top important ML scores were used to build the RSSM by stepwise Cox regression. Results The CatBoost model achieved the best discrimination when 12 top variables were input, with the AUC of 0.851 (95% confidence intervals (CI), 0.833-0.868) for TD, 0.817 (95%CI, 0.759-0.857) for ITD, and 0.791 (95%CI, 0.748-0.834) for ETD. The RSSM was developed based on the immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) (hazard ratios (HR), 0.678; 95%CI 0.549, 0.837), tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) (HR, 0.702; 95%CI 0.605, 0.814), local therapy (HR, 0.104; 95%CI 0.014, 0.747), response to the first IAT (HR, 4.221; 95%CI 2.229, 7.994), tumor size (HR, 1.054; 95%CI 1.038, 1.070), and BCLC grade (HR, 2.375; 95%CI 1.950, 2.894).

This study aimed to assess the efficacy and safety of lenvatinib combined with anti-programmed cell death-1 antibodies and transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (triple therapy) in patients with HCC and PVTT. Materials and Methods This retrospective multicenter study included patients with HCC and PVTT who received triple therapy, were aged between 18 and 75 years, classified as Child-Pugh class A or B, and had at least one measurable lesion. The overall survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS), objective response rates, and disease control rates were analyzed to assess efficacy. Treatment- related adverse events were analyzed to assess safety profiles. Results During a median follow-up of 11.23 months (range, 3.07 to 34.37 months), the median OS was greater than 24 months, and median PFS was 12.53 months. The 2-year OS rate was 54.9%. The objective response rate and disease control rate were 69.8% (74/106) and 84.0% (89/106), respectively; 20.8% (22/106) of the patients experienced grade 3/4 treatment-related adverse events and no treatment-related deaths occurred. The conversion rate to liver resection was 31.1% (33/106), with manageable postoperative complications. The median OS was not reached in the surgery group, but was 19.08 months in the non-surgery group. The median PFS in the surgery and non-surgery groups were 20.50 and 9.00 months, respectively.

105,Present and future of new systemic therapies for early and intermediate stages of hepatocellular carcinoma,10.3748/wjg.v30.i19.2512,"Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a high mortality neoplasm which usually appears on a cirrhotic liver. The therapeutic arsenal and subsequent prognostic outlook are intrinsically linked to the HCC stage at diagnosis. Notwithstanding the current deployment of treatments with curative intent (liver resection/local ablation and liver transplantation) in early and intermediate stages, a high rate of HCC recurrence persists, underscoring a pivotal clinical challenge. Emergent systemic therapies (ST), particularly immunotherapy, have demonstrate promising outcomes in terms of increase overall survival, but they are currently bound to the advanced stage of HCC. This review provides a comprehensive analysis of the literature, encompassing studies up to March 10, 2024, evaluating the impact of novel ST in the early and intermediate HCC stages, specially focusing on the findings of neoadjuvant and adjuvant regimens, aimed at increasing significantly overall survival and recurrence-free survival after a treatment with curative intent. We also investigate the potential role of ST in enhancing the downstaging rate for the intermediate-stage HCC initially deemed ineligible for treatment with curative intent. Finally, we critically discuss about the current relevance of the results of these studies and the encouraging future implications of ST in the treatment schedules of early and intermediate HCC stages.","Urquijo-Ponce, JJ; Alventosa-Mateu, C; Latorre-Sánchez, M; Castelló-Miralles, I; Diago, M",False,does not specify an intervention or study design,patients with hepatocellular carcinoma,not specified,not specified,overall survival and recurrence-free survival,not specified,,,,,,,,,,
106,Neoadjuvant and adjuvant systemic therapy in HCC: Current status and the future,10.1097/HC9.0000000000000430,"Surgical therapies in patients with early-stage HCC can afford long-term survival but are often limited by the continued risk of recurrence, underscoring an interest in (neo)adjuvant strategies. Prior attempts at adjuvant therapy using tyrosine kinase inhibitors failed to yield significant improvements in recurrence-free survival or overall survival. Advances in the efficacy of systemic therapy options, including the introduction of immune checkpoint inhibitors, have fueled renewed interest in this area. Indeed, the IMBrave050 trial recently demonstrated significant improvements in recurrence-free survival with 1 year of adjuvant atezolizumab plus bevacizumab in high-risk patients undergoing surgical resection or ablation, with several other ongoing trials in this space. There is a strong rationale for consideration of the administration of these therapies in the neoadjuvant setting, supported by early clinical data demonstrating high rates of objective responses, although larger trials examining downstream outcomes are necessary, particularly considering the possible risks of this strategy. In parallel, there has been increased interest in using systemic therapies as a bridging or downstaging strategy for liver transplantation. Current data suggest the short-term safety of this approach, with acceptable rates of rejection, so immunotherapy is not considered a contraindication to transplant; however, larger studies are needed to evaluate the incremental value of this approach over locoregional therapy. Conversely, the use of immunotherapy is currently discouraged after liver transplantation, given the high risk of graft rejection and death. The increasing complexity of HCC management and increased consideration of (neo)adjuvant strategies highlight the critical role of multidisciplinary care when making these decisions.","Singal, AG; Yarchoan, M; Yopp, A; Sapisochin, G; Pinato, DJ; Pillai, A",False,not a randomized controlled trial,patients with early-stage hepatocellular carcinoma,adjuvant atezolizumab plus bevacizumab,surgical therapies,recurrence-free survival,not specified,,,,,,,,,,

Methods: In this retrospective multicentre study, we included a total of 946 uHCC patients treated with atezolizumab and bevacizumab (Atez/Bev) from September 2020 to September 2023. Results: Out of the patients, 43 (4.5%) received conversion therapy following Atez/Bev treatment. The overall response rate was 65.1% and 23.7% in the conversion and non-conversion group, respectively, with a statistical significance (p < 0.001). Multivariate analyses identified that BCLC stage B or an earlier stage (p = 0.045), absence of macrovascular invasion and extrahepatic spread (p = 0.045), and a low value of neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio (p = 0.04) were significantly favourable predictive factors associated with conversion therapy. The conversion group showed significantly better survival compared to the non-conversion group (p < 0.001). In the landmark analysis at 6, 12 and 18 months, the conversion group exhibited better survival compared to PR patients in the non-conversion group (p = 0.04, 0.01 and 0.03, respectively) and there were no significant differences in the overall survival (OS) between the conversion group and patients who achieved a CR (p = 0.7, 1.0 and 0.3, respectively). Conclusions: Patients with low tumour burden and low value of NLR were more likely to undergo conversion therapy.

This study aimed to evaluate the conversion rate and clinical outcomes of a first-line conversion regimen of lenvatinib combined with transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) plus immunotherapy for initial uHCC by interpreting real-world data. Methods Conversion therapy data of patients with uHCC from November 2018 to January 2021 were analysed. The regimens included triple combination therapy (t-CT: lenvatinib, TACE, plus toripalimab) and dual combination therapy (d-CT: lenvatinib plus TACE). Another study population diagnosed with hepatocellular carcinoma of macrovascular invasion disease were included as the upfront surgery cohort. Treatment responses and conversion rate were primary outcomes. Survival and adverse events were analysed. Results Fifty-one patients receiving t-CT (n = 30) and d-CT (n = 21) were enrolled. Higher overall response rates (76.7 per cent versus 47.6 per cent, P = 0.042) and disease control rates (90.0 per cent versus 57.1 per cent, P = 0.042) were observed via t-CT than d-CT. Both median overall survival and event-free survival were not reached in the t-CT cohort. A higher rate of curative conversion resection was achieved through t-CT than d-CT (50.0 per cent versus 19.0 per cent, P = 0.039). The disease-free survival of patients undergoing conversion resection in the t-CT cohort (n = 15) was higher than that in the upfront surgery cohort (n = 68, P = 0.039). Both t-CT and d-CT regimens were tolerable. Conclusions Better treatment responses and conversion rate for patients with uHCC were obtained with first-line t-CT.

Methods Consecutive patients with initial PD-L1-positive uHCC who received pembrolizumab-lenvatinib-TACE or lenvatinib-TACE sequential therapy were retrospectively identified from three medical institutions during 2016-2020. The primary endpoints included the rate of conversion therapy, defined as converting initially uHCC to hepatectomy, overall survival (OS), and progression-free survival (PFS); secondary endpoint was the frequency of key adverse events (AEs). Results In total, 220 consecutively recruited patients were retrospectively reviewed, 78 of whom were ineligible according to the current criteria, leaving 142 patients [pembrolizumab-lenvatinib-TACE: n = 70, median age 58 years (range 36-69) and lenvatinib-TACE: n = 72, 57 years (35-68)] who were eligible for the study. The median duration of follow-up was 27 months [95% confidence interval (CI), 26.3-28.7 months]. At the last follow-up, the rate of conversion therapy was 25.7% in the pembrolizumab-lenvatinib-TACE group and 11.1% in the lenvatinib-TACE group (p = 0.025).

The association between AFP response-defined as a >= 80% decrease in final AFP levels before salvage hepatectomy from diagnosis-and RFS post-hepatectomy was investigated. <bold>Results: </bold>AFP responders demonstrated significantly better postoperative RFS compared to non-responders (P<0.001). The median RFS was not reached for AFP responders, with 1-year and 2-year RFS rates of 81.3% and 70.8%, respectively. In contrast, AFP non-responders had a median RFS of 7.43 months, with 1-year and 2-year RFS rates at 37.1% and 37.1%, respectively. Multivariate Cox regression analysis identified AFP response as an independent predictor of RFS. Integrating AFP response with radiologic tumor response facilitated further stratification of patients into distinct risk categories: those with radiologic remission experienced the most favorable RFS, followed by patients with partial response/stable disease and AFP response, and the least favorable RFS among patients with partial response/stable disease but without AFP response. Sensitivity analyses further confirmed the association between AFP response and improved RFS across various cutoff values and in patients with AFP >= 200 ng/mL at diagnosis (all P<0.05). <bold>Conclusion: </bold>The ""20-80"" rule based on AFP response could be helpful for clinicians to preoperatively stratify the risk of patients undergoing salvage hepatectomy, enabling identification and management of those unlikely to benefit from this procedure.","Lin, KY; Zhang, JX; Lin, ZW; Chen, QJ; Luo, LP; Chen, JH; Wang, K; Tai, S; Zhang, ZB; Wang, SF; Li, JD; Wang, K; Zheng, L; Zheng, SM; Wu, MM; Lin, KC; Yang, T; Zeng, YY",False,does not meet randomized controlled trial design requirement,patients with unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma,tyrosine kinase inhibitor and anti-PD-1 antibody,not specified,recurrence-free survival rates,multicenter retrospective study,,,,,,,,,,

We report the first use of preoperative cabozantinib plus nivolumab to successfully downstage what presented as unresectable HCC as part of an ongoing phase 1b study. Preoperative treatment with cabozantinib and nivolumab led to >99% reduction in alpha-fetoprotein, -37.3% radiographic reduction by RECIST 1.1 and a near complete pathologic response (80% to 100% necrosis). An integrated immunological analysis was performed on the post-treatment surgical tumor sample and matched pre-treatment and post-treatment peripheral blood samples with high-dimensional imaging and cytometry techniques. Bayesian non-negative matrix factorization (CoGAPS, Coordinated Gene Activity in Pattern Sets) and self-organizing map (FlowSOM) algorithms were used to distinguish changes in functional markers across cellular neighborhoods in the single cell data sets. Brisk immunological infiltration into the tumor microenvironment was observed in non-random, organized cellular neighborhoods. Systemically, combination therapy led to marked promotion of effector cytotoxic T cells and effector memory helper T cells. Natural killer cells also increased with therapy. The patient remains without disease recurrence and with a normal alpha-fetoprotein approximately 2 years from presentation.

116,Immunotherapy for hepatocellular carcinoma: The next evolution in expanding access to liver transplantation,10.1016/j.jhep.2024.05.037,"Immunotherapy has revolutionised the treatment of advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). In addition, several phase III trials of immunotherapy in combination with surgical or locoregional therapies for early-to intermediate-stage HCC have recently reported positive results, and other phase III trials in the same patient population are currently in progress. As the application of immunotherapy is shifting to include patients with earlier stages of HCC, one looming question now emerges: What is the role of immunotherapy in the pre-liver transplant population? Liver transplantation is a potentially curative therapy for HCC and confers the additional advantage of restoring a normal, healthy liver. In pre-transplant patients, immunotherapy may improve downstaging success and tumour control at the cost of some immunologic risks. These include immune-related toxicities, which are particularly relevant in a uniquely vulnerable population with chronic liver disease, and the possibility of acute rejection after transplantation. Ultimately, the goal of immunotherapy in this population will be to effectively expand access to liver transplantation while preserving preand post-transplant outcomes. In this review, we discuss the mechanisms supporting combination immunotherapy, summarise key recent clinical data from major immunotherapy trials, and explore how immunotherapy can be applied in the neoadjuvant setting prior to liver transplantation in selected high-risk patients.

117,Downstaging and laparoscopic hepatectomy plus intraoperative radiofrequency ablation for the treatment of initially unresectable multifocal hepatocellular carcinomas,10.3389/fsurg.2023.1340657,"BackgroundUsing TKIs plus anti-PD-1 antibodies combined with TACE in the treatment of patients with initially unresectable multiple HCCs has a high tumour response rate, and using laparoscopic hepatectomy (LH) combined with intraoperative RFA for radical treatment of multiple HCCs after successful downstaging treatment has not been reported.MethodsConsecutive patients with multiple HCCs (<= 4 lesions) who were downstaged with TKIs plus anti-PD-1 antibodies combined with TACE were analysed. Imaging examinations were performed monthly, and RECIST v1.1 criteria were used to evaluate treatment effect and resectability.ResultsForty-five consecutive patients with multiple HCCs who met the inclusion criteria received downstaging treatment with TKIs plus anti-PD-1 antibodies combined with TACE. Nine patients were successfully downstaged and met the R0 resection criteria, and 8 patients underwent surgery. Among the patients, 5 patients had BCLC stage C, and 3 patients had BCLC stage B. There were 2 lesions in 5 patients, 3 lesions in 2 patients, and 4 lesions in 1 patient. The average size of the main HCC was 8.5 cm (range: 5.4-9.1 cm), and the diameter of the remaining HCCs was 1.6 cm (range: 0.8-2.9 cm). The average time from the start of downstaging therapy to surgery was 81 days (range: 60-210 days). All 8 patients underwent LH of the main HCC, and the remaining HCCs were targeted with RFA. The mean operation time was 220 min (range 150-370 min), the average intraoperative blood loss was 260 ml (range 100-750 ml), there was no case conversion to laparotomy, and the average postoperative hospital stay was 9 days (range 7-25 days). The incidence of postoperative complications was 37.5% and there were no deaths. The average follow-up time was 18.2 months (range 6.1-22.4 months), 5 patients survived tumour-free, 2 patients had tumour recurrence, and 1 patient died.ConclusionsAfter successful downstaging of multiple HCCs by treatment with TKIs plus anti-PD-1 antibodies and TACE, LH combined with RFA for radical surgery is safe and feasible, and the treatment effect is satisfactory. It is worthy of clinical reference, and its long-term effects require further research for confirmation.","Wang, JJ; Luo, H; Yi, L; Yang, P; Zeng, XT",False,lacks randomized controlled trial design and comparison group,patients with multiple unresectable HCCs,TKIs plus anti-PD-1 antibodies combined with TACE,not specified,tumor response rate and resectability,not specified,,,,,,,,,,
118,Management of hepatocellular carcinoma patients with portal vein tumor thrombosis: A narrative review,10.1016/j.hbpd.2021.12.004,"Background: Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the main reasons for malignancy-related death. Portal vein tumor thrombosis (PVTT) is the most common form of macrovascular invasion related to HCC occurring in 10%-60% of patients. HCC with PVTT is usually characterized by worsening liver function, vulnerability to blood metastasis, higher incidence of complications associated with portal hypertension, and intolerance to treatment when compared with that without PVTT. If only treated with supportive care, the median survival of HCC with PVTT is about 2.7 months. In the past, sorafenib was the only recommended therapy by guidelines with limited effectiveness. This narrative review aimed to describe the current management options for HCC with PVTT. Data sources: We have reviewed literature from PubMed on the treatment of HCC with PVTT and compiled evidence-based facts on effective therapies available for different types of PVTT. Results: Sorafenib monotherapy is not much effective, but combining it with other methods can improve survival. Each type of PVTT can benefit from the combination of transarterial chemoembolization and sorafenib than sorafenib monotherapy. The tumor downstaging can be realized possibly after transarterial chemoembolization, but tumor invasion into the main trunk of the portal vein greatly impairs efficacy. Although surgery is a curative approach, it is often not recommended for Vp4 PVTT. Some new methods can broaden the indication, but further explorations are needed. Radiotherapy can decrease the possibility of Vp3 progression to Vp4, but building a forecast model of best radiation dose and response is necessary. Systemic chemotherapy, hepatic arterial infusion chemotherapy, radiofrequency ablation, portal stenting, and traditional Chinese medicine are also beneficial in Vp3-4 PVTT. The accurate diagnosis of PVTT can be made by radiomics, and prognostic classification models can be used to design personalized treatments. The application of new treatment methods such as the atezolizumab plus bevacizumab scheme may increase survival. Conclusions: HCC with PVTT is still a thorny problem, and effective therapeutics need to be explored. (c) 2021 First Affiliated Hospital, Zhejiang University School of Medicine in China.

119,In the Era of Systemic Therapy for Hepatocellular Carcinoma Is Transarterial Chemoembolization Still a Card to Play?,10.3390/cancers13205129,"Simple Summary: Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a growing healthcare problem, with most of the cases occurring in patients with an underlying chronic liver disease. Transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) is recommended for unresectable tumors, mostly in a palliative setting. Several developments have seen the day during the last few years, with technique improvements in terms of efficacy and safety due to more selective therapies and better patient selection. Nevertheless, this is the era of systemic treatment for HCC, where immunotherapy and combination systemic treatments are taking the lead. As such, we have to ask ourselves, where does TACE stand today and is there a tomorrow? Conventional transarterial embolization (cTACE) has been proven to be effective for intermediate stage hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), with a recent systematic review showing an overall survival (OS) of 19.4 months. Nevertheless, due to the rapid development of the systemic therapeutic landscape, the place of TACE is becoming questionable. Is there still a niche for TACE in the era of immunotherapy and combination treatments such as atezolizumab-bevacizumab, which has shown an OS of 19.2 months with excellent tolerance? The development of drug-eluting microspheres (DEMs) has led to the standardization of the technique, and along with adequate selection, it showed an OS of 48 months in a retrospective study. In order to increase treatment selectivity, new catheters have also been added to the TACE arsenal as well as the use of cone-beam CT (CBCT), which provides three-dimensional volumetric images and guidance during procedures. Moreover, the TACE indications have also widened. It may serve as a ""bridging therapy "" for liver transplantation candidates while they are on the waiting list, and it represents a valuable downstaging tool to transplantation criteria. The aim of this review is to explore the current data on the advancements of TACE and its future place amongst the growing panel of treatments.","Bucalau, AM; Tancredi, I; Verset, G",False,not a clinical trial and lacks a clear comparison group,patients with intermediate stage hepatocellular carcinoma,transarterial chemoembolization,not specified,overall survival,not specified,,,,,,,,,,

Liver transplantation provides the best long-term outcomes for those meeting strict criteria. Efforts have been made to expand these criteria, whereas others have attempted downstaging approaches. Although locoregional approaches to downstaging are appealing and have demonstrated efficacy, limitations and challenges exists including poor imaging modality to assess response and appropriate endpoints along the process. Recent advances in systemic treatments including immune checkpoint inhibitors alone or in combination with tyrosine kinase inhibitors have prompted the discussion regarding their role for downstaging disease prior to transplantation. Here, we provide a review of prior locoregional approaches for downstaging, new systemic agents and their role for downstaging, and finally, key and critical considerations of the assessment, endpoints, and optimal designs in clinical trials to address this key question.","Tran, NH; Muñoz, S; Thompson, S; Hallemeier, CL; Bruix, J",False,does not specify a comparison or study design,patients with hepatocellular carcinoma,immune checkpoint inhibitors and tyrosine kinase inhibitors,not specified,not specified,not specified,,,,,,,,,,
121,Cost-effectiveness of selective internal radiation therapy with Y-90 resin microspheres for intermediate- and advanced-stage hepatocellular carcinoma in Brazil,10.1080/13696998.2023.2210475,"Aims Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a severe condition with poor prognosis that places a significant burden on patients, caregivers, and healthcare systems. Selective internal radiation therapy (SIRT) is a treatment available to patients with HCC which addresses some of the limitations of alternative treatment options. A cost-effectiveness analysis was undertaken into the use of SIRT using Y-90 resin microspheres for the treatment of unresectable intermediate- and late-stage HCC in Brazil. Materials and methods A partitioned-survival model was developed, including a tunnel state for patients downstaged to receive treatments with curative intent. Sorafenib was the selected comparator, a common systemic treatment in Brazil and for which comparative evidence exists. Clinical data were extracted from published sources of pivotal trials, and effectiveness was measured in quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) and life-years (LYs). The analysis was conducted from the Brazilian private payer perspective and a lifetime horizon was implemented. Comprehensive sensitivity analyses were conducted. Results LYs and QALYs were higher for SIRT with Y-90 resin microspheres versus sorafenib (0.27 and 0.20 incremental LYs and QALYs, respectively) and costs were slightly higher for SIRT (R$15,864). The base case incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) was R$77,602 per QALY. The ICER was mostly influenced by parameters defining the sorafenib overall survival curve and SIRT had a 73% probability of being cost-effective at a willingness-to-pay threshold of R$135,761 per QALY (3-times the per-capita gross domestic product in Brazil). Overall, sensitivity analyses confirmed the robustness of the results indicating that SIRT with Y-90 resin microspheres is cost-effective compared with sorafenib. Limitations A rapidly evolving treatment landscape in Brazil and worldwide, and the lack of local data for some variables were the main limitations. Conclusions SIRT with Y-90 resin microspheres is a cost-effective option compared with sorafenib in Brazil.","Agirrezabal, I; Grillo, LSP; Nasser, F; Brennan, VK; Bugano, D; Galastri, FL; de Azeredo-da-Silva, ALF; Shergill, S; da Motta-Leal, JM",False,not a randomized controlled trial,patients with unresectable intermediate- and late-stage HCC,SIRT using Y-90 resin microspheres,sorafenib,LYs and QALYs,not a randomized controlled trial,,,,,,,,,,
122,Downstaging Hepatocellular Carcinoma before Transplantation Role of Immunotherapy Versus Locoregional Approaches,10.1016/j.soc.2023.07.001,"HCC continues to be a leading cause of cancer-related death in the United States. With advances in locoregional therapy for unresectable HCC during the last 2 decades and the recent expansion of transplant criteria for HCC, as well as ongoing organ shortages, patients are spending more time on the waitlist, which has resulted in increased usage of locoregional therapies. This changing landscape is well displayedin Fig. 1, which demonstrates the number of treatments per patient by year of listing (A) and the proportion of locoregional therapy type by year of treatment (B).91 Less than half of liver transplant candidates on the waiting list underwent locoregional therapy before listing in 2003, whereas 92.4% underwent some form of locoregional therapy in 2018.91 Although TACE is the current preferred modality for liver-directed therapy as a bridge to transplant in patients with HCC, recent evidence suggests that radioembolization may prolong time to progression when compared with chemoembolization. In just the last 5 years, the proportion of radioembolization performed for HCC has increased significantly, from less than 5% in 2013 to 19% in 2018.91 Expanding on the proven value of locoregional therapies, the plethora of molecularly targeted therapies and ICIs under investigation represent the new horizon of treatment of HCC not only in advanced stages but also potentially at every stage of diagnosis and management. Although data remain sparse in the pretransplantation population, the possibility of downstaging patients previously considered unresectable or initially outside of transplant criteria is an extremely alluring strategy, which may prove vital in establishing transplant candidacy for an expanded host of patients. Combination therapies have already begun to show promise in maintaining disease control and may ultimately prove lifesaving in patients who are able to undergo liver transplant. Although it will be critical in the coming years to determine timing of therapy and appropriate postoperative immunosuppression strategies, both locoregional techniques and immunomodulation will change the history of liver transplant for HCC as we currently know it.","Lindemann, J; Yu, J; Doyle, MBM",False,does not specify a comparison or study design,patients with hepatocellular carcinoma,locoregional therapies and immune checkpoint inhibitors,not specified,not specified,not specified,,,,,,,,,,

125,Novel implications in the treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma,10.20524/aog.2016.0092,"Worldwide hepatocellular carcinoma remains one of the leading causes of cancer-related death, associated with a poor prognosis due to late diagnosis in the majority of cases. Physicians at care are frequently confronted with patients who are ineligible for curative treatment such as liver resection, transplantation or radiofrequency ablation. Besides established palliative locoregional therapies, such as ablation or chemoembolization, new treatment options, such as microwave ablation, drug-eluting bead transarterial chemoembolization or selective internal radiation therapy, are emerging; however, data from randomized controlled trials are still lacking. In order to achieve optimal tumor control, patients should receive tailored treatment concepts, considering their tumor burden, liver function and performance status, instead of strictly assigning patients to treatment modalities following algorithms that may be partly very restrictive. Palliative locoregional pretreatment might facilitate downstaging to ensure later curative resection or transplantation. In addition, the combined utilization of different locoregional treatment options or systemic co-treatment has been the subject of several trials. In cases where local tumor control cannot be achieved, or in the scenario of extrahepatic spread, sorafenib remains the only approved systemic therapy option. Alternative targeted therapies, such as immune checkpoint inhibitors have shown encouraging preliminary results, while data from phase III studies are pending.","Best, J; Schotten, C; Theysohn, JM; Wetter, A; Müller, S; Radünz, S; Schulze, M; Canbay, A; Dechêne, A; Gerken, G",False,"does not specify intervention, comparison, or outcomes",patients with hepatocellular carcinoma,not specified,not specified,not specified,not specified,,,,,,,,,,

129,Focal Update on Immunotherapy and Liver Transplantation in the Era of Transplant Oncology,10.3390/curroncol31090371,"Transplant oncology is an expanding area of cancer therapy that specifically emphasizes the use of liver transplantation (LT) as the preferred treatment for patients with manageable, but unresectable, tumors. The management and optimization of overall survival strategies, accompanied by an arguably decent quality of life, have been at the forefront of liver oncology treatment, as a plurality of all primary liver cancers are identified as either hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) or cholangiocarcinoma (CCA), which are classified as highly aggressive malignancies and frequently remain asymptomatic until they progress to advanced stages, rendering curative procedures, such as resection, impractical. This has led to an increase in utilization of neoadjuvant interventions conducted prior to surgery, which has yielded favorable outcomes. Though this treatment modality has prompted further investigations into the efficacy of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICPIs) as standalone treatments and in combination with locoregional treatments (LRTs) to bridge more patients into curative eligibility. This multidisciplinary methodology and treatment planning has seen multiple successful trials of immunotherapy regimes and combinate treatments, setting the groundwork for increasing eligibility through downstaging and ""bridging"" previously ineligible patients within stringent LT criteria. Surveillance after LT is a crucial component of transplant oncology. The emergence of circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) has provided a novel approach to identifying the recurrence of cancer in its early stages. Recent research has focused on liquid biopsy, a technique that effectively identifies the dynamics of cancer. This is another innovation to demonstrate the rate at which transplant oncology is rapidly advancing, making the focus of care feel disorienting. Modalities of care are constantly evolving, but when a field is changing as rapidly as this one, it is imperative to reorient to the data and the needs of the patients.

131,Portal Vein Tumor Thrombosis and Hepatocellular Carcinoma - The Changing Tides.,10.2147/JHC.S318070,"Portal vein involvement is considered one of the most fearful complications of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Portal vein tumor thrombosis (PVTT) is associated with aggressive tumor biology (high grade), high tumor burden (number and size of lesions), high levels of serum markers (AFP), poor liver function (deranged LFT), and poor performance status of patients. The Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer staging system places HCC patients with PVTT in advanced stage (BCLC Stage-C). This group contains a fairly heterogeneous patient population, previously considered candidates for palliative systemic therapy with sorafenib. However, this provided modest overall survival (OS) benefit. The results of a recent Phase III (IMbrave150) trial favor the combination of atezolizumab and bevacizumab over sorafenib as a standard of care in advanced unresectable HCC. While only lenvatinib proved to be non-inferior against sorafenib in a phase III (REFLECT trial), regorafenib (RESORCE trial), ramucirumab (REACH-2), and cabozantinib (CELESTIAL) have been approved second-line therapy in phase III clinical trials. Recently, the data on the prospect of other modalities in the management of HCC with PVTT is mounting with favorable results. Targeting multiple pathways in the HCC cascade using a combination of drugs and other modalities such as RT, TACE, TARE, and HAIC appear effective for systemic and loco-regional control. The quest for the ideal combination therapy and the sequence set is still widely unanswered and prospective trials are lacking.

Combination therapy of tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) and anti-programmed cell death protein-1 (PD-1) antibodies has achieved a high tumor response rate in both the first-line and second-line treatment of advanced HCC. However, few studies have prospectively evaluated whether TKIs plus anti-PD-1 antibodies could convert unresectable intermediate-advanced HCC into resectable disease. METHODS: This single-arm, phase II study enrolled systemic therapy-naïve adult patients with unresectable Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer stage B or C HCC. Patients received oral lenvatinib one time per day plus intravenous anti-PD-1 agents every 3 weeks (one cycle). Tumor response and resectability were evaluated before the fourth cycle, then every two cycles. The primary endpoint was conversion success rate by investigator assessment. Secondary endpoints included objective response rate (ORR) by independent imaging review (IIR) assessment per modified RECIST (mRECIST) and Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors, V.1.1 (RECIST 1.1), progression-free survival (PFS) and 12-month recurrence-free survival (RFS) rate by IIR per mRECIST, R0 resection rate, overall survival (OS), and safety. Biomarkers were assessed as exploratory objectives. RESULTS: Of the 56 eligible patients enrolled, 53 (94.6%) had macrovascular invasion, and 16 (28.6%) had extrahepatic metastasis. The median follow-up was 23.5 months. The primary endpoint showed a conversion success rate of 55.4% (31/56). ORR was 53.6% per mRECIST and 44.6% per RECIST 1.1. Median PFS was 8.9 months, and median OS was 23.9 months. Among the 31 successful conversion patients, 21 underwent surgery with an R0 resection rate of 85.7%, a pathological complete response rate of 38.1%, and a 12-month RFS rate of 47.6%. Grade ≥3 treatment-related adverse events were observed in 42.9% of patients. Tumor immune microenvironment analysis of pretreatment samples displayed significant enrichment of CD8(+) T cells (p=0.03) in responders versus non-responders. CONCLUSION: Lenvatinib plus anti-PD-1 antibodies demonstrate promising efficacy and tolerable safety as conversion therapy in unresectable HCC.

133,"Pretransplant use of immune checkpoint inhibitors for hepatocellular carcinoma: A multicenter, retrospective cohort study.",10.1016/j.ajt.2024.04.007,"Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) as a downstaging or bridging therapy for liver transplantation (LT) in hepatocellular carcinoma patients are rapidly increasing. However, the evidence about the feasibility and safety of pre-LT ICI therapy is limited and controversial. To this end, a multicenter, retrospective cohort study was conducted in 11 Chinese centers. The results showed that 83 recipients received pre-LT ICI therapy during the study period. The median post-LT follow-up was 8.1 (interquartile range 3.3-14.6) months. During the short follow-up, 23 (27.7%) recipients developed allograft rejection, and 7 of them (30.4%) were diagnosed by liver biopsy. Multivariate logistics regression analysis showed that the time interval between the last administration of ICI therapy and LT (TLAT) ≥ 30 days was an independent protective factor for allograft rejection (odds ratio = 0.096, 95% confidence interval 0.026-0.357; P < .001). Multivariate Cox analysis showed that allograft rejection was an independent risk factor for overall survival (hazard ratio = 9.960, 95% confidence interval 1.006-98.610; P = .043). We conclude that patients who receive a pre-LT ICI therapy with a TLAT shorter than 30 days have a much higher risk of allograft rejection than those with a TLAT longer than 30 days.

134,Updates on the Diagnosis and Management of Hepatocellular Carcinoma.,10.5005/jp-journals-10018-1335,"INTRODUCTION: Globally, the incidence, as well as mortality, related to hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is on the rise, owing to relatively few curative options. Underlying cirrhosis is the most common etiology leading to HCC, but risk factors of cirrhosis show great regional variability. Over the years, there has been a steady development in the diagnostic and therapeutic modalities of HCC, including the availability of a wide range of systemic chemotherapeutic agents. We aim to review the recent advancements in the diagnostic and therapeutic strategies for HCC. METHODOLOGY: The literature search was done using databases PubMed, Cochrane, and Science Direct, and the latest relevant articles were reviewed. FINDINGS: Screening of HCC is a pivotal step in the early diagnosis of the disease. Current guidelines recommend using ultrasound and alfa fetoprotein but various new biomarkers are under active research that might aid in diagnosing very small tumors, not picked up by the current screening methods. Treatment options are decided based upon the overall performance of the patient and the extent of the disease, as per the Barcelona classification. There are very few options that offer a cure for the disease, ranging from liver resection and transplantation to tumor ablation. Downstaging has proven to have a significant role in the course of the disease. An attempt to control the disease can be made via radiological interventions, such as transarterial chemoembolization, transarterial radioembolization, or radiation therapy. For advanced disease, sorafenib used to be the only option until a couple of years ago. Recently, many other systemic agents have received approval as first-line and second-line therapies for HCC. Genomics is an area of active clinical research as understanding the mutations and genomics involved in the evolution of HCC might lead to a breakthrough therapy.

135,Radiation therapy in the era of immune treatment for hepatocellular carcinoma.,10.3389/fimmu.2023.1100079,"Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) have revolutionized cancer treatment in recent years and provide new opportunities to treat hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). To date, several ICIs have been approved by the FDA for advanced HCC in first-line or second-line therapy. Downstaging conversion therapy for potentially resectable HCC to provide opportunities for surgical intervention is challenging. ICIs have become a hot spot in this field due to their high response rate. However, HCC has various etiologies and can evade the immune system through multiple mechanisms, which limit the efficacy of ICI monotherapy and demand novel combination strategies. Radiation therapy (RT) is also a candidate for conversion therapy in HCC and is currently gaining increasing attention as a good combination partner with ICIs due to its ability to modulate the tumor microenvironment. In this review, we illustrate the current indications for ICIs and RT in HCC, the rationale for their synergistic combination, and the current clinical trials in combination therapy. We also speculate on predictive biomarkers and novel future strategies to further enhance the efficacy of this combination. This review aims to provide references for future research on radiation and immunotherapy to arrive at a promising new era of HCC treatment.",Chen L; Zhang R; Lin Z; Tan Q; Huang Z; Liang B,False,does not specify a comparison or outcome,patients with hepatocellular carcinoma,immune checkpoint inhibitors and radiation therapy,not specified,not specified,not specified,,,,,,,,,,
136,Hepatocellular carcinoma: Advances in systemic therapies.,10.12688/f1000research.145493.2,"Advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is traditionally associated with limited treatment options and a poor prognosis. Sorafenib, a multiple tyrosine kinase inhibitor, was introduced in 2007 as a first-in-class systemic agent for advanced HCC. After sorafenib, a range of targeted therapies and immunotherapies have demonstrated survival benefits in the past 5 years, revolutionizing the treatment landscape of advanced HCC. More recently, evidence of novel combinations of systemic agents with distinct mechanisms has emerged. In particular, combination trials on atezolizumab plus bevacizumab and durvalumab plus tremelimumab have shown encouraging efficacy. Hence, international societies have revamped their guidelines to incorporate new recommendations for these novel systemic agents. Aside from treatment in advanced HCC, the indications for systemic therapy are expanding. For example, the combination of systemic therapeutics with locoregional therapy (trans-arterial chemoembolization or stereotactic body radiation therapy) has demonstrated promising early results in downstaging HCC. Recent trials have also explored the role of systemic therapy as neoadjuvant treatment for borderline-resectable HCC or as adjuvant treatment to reduce recurrence risk after curative resection. Despite encouraging results from clinical trials, the real-world efficacy of systemic agents in specific patient subgroups (such as patients with advanced cirrhosis, high bleeding risk, renal impairment, or cardiometabolic diseases) remains uncertain. The effect of liver disease etiology on systemic treatment efficacy warrants further research. With an increased understanding of the pathophysiological pathways and accumulation of clinical data, personalized treatment decisions will be possible, and the field of systemic treatment for HCC will continue to evolve.",Wu TK; Hui RW; Mak LY; Fung J; Seto WK; Yuen MF,False,does not specify a direct comparison against ICIs or a randomized controlled trial design,patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma,various systemic therapies including immunotherapies,not specified,survival benefits,not specified,,,,,,,,,,
137,Immune Checkpoint Inhibitors as Therapy to Down-Stage Hepatocellular Carcinoma Prior to Liver Transplantation.,10.3390/cancers14092056,"Hepatocellular Carcinoma (HCC) is the most common liver malignancy and third leading cause of cancer death worldwide. For early- and intermediate-stage disease, liver-directed therapies for locoregional control, or down-staging prior to definitive surgical therapy with hepatic resection or liver transplantation, have been studied broadly, and are the mainstays of current treatment guidelines. As HCC incidence has continued to grow, and with more patients presenting with advanced disease, our current treatment modalities do not suffice, and better therapies are needed to improve disease-specific and overall survival. Until recently, sorafenib was the only systemic therapy utilized, and was associated with dismal results. The advent of immuno-oncology has been of significant interest, and has changed the paradigm of therapy for HCC. Lately, combination regimens including atezolizumab plus bevacizumab; durvalumab plus tremelimumab; and pembrolizumab plus Lenvatinib have shown impressive responses of between 25-35%; this is much higher than responses observed with single agents. Complete responses with checkpoint inhibitor therapy have been observed in advanced-stage HCC patients. These dramatic results have naturally led to several questions. Can or should checkpoint inhibitors, or other immunotherapy combinations, be used routinely before resection or transplant? Is there a synergistic effect of immunotherapy with locoregional therapy, and will pre-treatment increase disease-free survival after surgical intervention? Is it immunologically safe to use these therapies prior to transplantation? Much is still to be learned in terms of the dosing, timing, and overall utility of the use of immune checkpoint inhibitors for pre-transplant care and down-staging. More studies will be needed to understand the management of adverse events while maximizing the therapeutic window of these agents. In this review, we look at the current data on therapy with immune checkpoint inhibitors in advanced HCC, with a focus on pre-transplant treatment prior to liver transplant.",Katariya NN; Lizaola-Mayo BC; Chascsa DM; Giorgakis E; Aqel BA; Moss AA; Uson Junior PLS; Borad MJ; Mathur AK,False,does not provide comparison or describe a randomized controlled trial,patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma,immune checkpoint inhibitors,not specified,response rates,not specified,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: A systematic literature search was conducted on PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science, Scopus, and the Cochrane Library between 2007 and 2024 focusing on studies reporting conversion therapy for HCC. The treatment groups were divided into Tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI), TKI plus loco-regional therapy (LRT), TKI plus anti-PD-1 therapy (TKI + PD-1), TKI + PD-1 + LRT, immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) plus LRT, and Atezolizumab plus bevacizumab (A + T) groups. The conversion to surgery rate (CSR), objective response rate (ORR), grade ≥ 3 treatment-related adverse events (AEs), overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) were analyzed. RESULTS: 38 studies and 4,042 patients were included. The pooled CSR were 8% (95% CI, 5-12%) in TKI group, 13% (95% CI, 8-19%) in TKI + LRT group, 28% (95% CI, 19-37%) in TKI + PD-1 group, 33% (95% CI, 25-41%) in TKI + PD-1 + LRT group, 23% (95% CI, 1-46%) in ICI + LRT group, and 5% (95% CI, 3-8%) in A + T group, respectively. The pooled HR for OS (0.45, 95% CI, 0.35-0.60) and PFS (0.49, 95% CI, 0.35-0.70) favored survival benefit of conversion surgery. Subgroup analysis revealed that lenvatinib + PD-1 + LRT conferred higher CSR of 35% (95% CI, 26-44%) and increased ORR of 70% (95% CI, 56-83%). CONCLUSIONS: The current study indicates that TKI + PD-1 + LRT, especially lenvatinib + PD-1 + LRT, may be the superior conversion therapy with a manageable safety profile for patients with initially unresectable HCC. The successful conversion therapy favors the superior OS and PFS compared with systemic treatment alone.

139,,,"Primary liver cancer has the sixth-highest incidence of all cancers and is the fourth-largest cause of cancer-related mortality worldwide. Estimates for 2020 suggested that 3,100 Canadians would be diagnosed with primary liver cancer and that 1,450 Canadians would die from it. In particular, data from the Long Form Census in Canada suggest that members of First Nations have disproportionately high rates of primary liver cancer, emphasizing the importance of attention to this condition in Canadian settings. While the prevalence and cancer-related mortality of primary liver cancer are higher in males (accounting for 10.2% of all cancer-related deaths in males worldwide), primary liver cancer is still a significant cause of disease burden in females (5.6% of all cancer-related deaths in females worldwide). The most common type of primary liver cancer is hepatocellular carcinoma, which accounts for approximately 80% to 85% of primary liver cancers.(,) Risk factors for the development of hepatocellular carcinoma include chronic alcohol consumption, viral hepatitis (e.g., hepatitis B, hepatitis C), cirrhosis of any etiology, and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease.(,) Treatment options for hepatocellular carcinoma consist of surgical (e.g., resection and liver transplantation) and non-surgical techniques, including locoregional therapies (e.g., percutaneous ethanol injection, radiofrequency or microwave ablation, transarterial chemoembolization [TACE] or transarterial radioembolization [TARE]) and systemic therapies (e.g., sorafenib, lenvatinib, and atezolizumab-bevacizumab). The selection of appropriate treatment is typically informed by tumour stage, liver function, and patient performance status, all of which are important factors that may influence treatment outcomes,(,) and selection is best done by a multi-disciplinary team. Surgical resection is the treatment of choice for patients with single nodules, no underlying cirrhosis, and good liver function. While patients who undergo surgical resection have a reasonably good prognosis (a 5-year survival rate of approximately 70%), a majority of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma are diagnosed with advanced disease when patients become symptomatic and have some degree of liver impairment. In many of these cases, surgical resection may no longer be appropriate. As a form of radiation therapy for patients with advanced or inoperable hepatocellular carcinoma, TARE (also known as selective internal radiation therapy [SIRT]) has been used to downstage patients before surgery or to bridge patients to liver transplantation. As part of this procedure microspheres loaded with a radioactive isotope, most commonly yttirium-90 ((90)Y), are delivered into the hepatic artery via a catheter inserted into the femoral artery. The therapy delivers a high dose of targeted radiation directly to the cancer cells, while also blocking the supply of blood to the tumour. Conventional transarterial chemoembolization (cTACE) is administered using a procedure similar to TARE; however, instead of radiation the patient is given regional chemotherapy (usually doxorubicin or cisplatin) before an embolic agent. TACE can also be performed using drug-eluting beads that combine the chemotherapeutic agent with the embolic agent (i.e., drug-eluting bead transarterial chemoembolization [DEB-TACE]). The objective of this report is to evaluate the evidence regarding the clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of TARE using (90)Y microspheres to support decisions involving the use of this therapy to treat patients with intermediate- or advanced-stage hepatocellular carcinoma. This report complements previous CADTH evaluations of the evidence regarding the use of (90)Y microspheres for the treatment of other cancers, including uveal melanoma liver metastases, liver metastases from colorectal cancer, and primary or secondary liver cancer.",Young C; Subramonian A; Argáez C,False,"does not specify any intervention, comparison, or study design",patients with primary liver cancer including hepatocellular carcinoma,not specified,not specified,not specified,not specified,,,,,,,,,,

In this review, we identify reports and series, comprising a total of 43 patients who received immune checkpoint inhibitors as bridging or down-staging therapies prior to LT. Overall, treated patients registered an objective response rate of 21%, and 14 patients were reduced within the Milan criteria. Graft rejection was reported in seven patients, resulting in the death of four patients; in the remaining cases, LT was performed safely after immunotherapy. Further investigations are required to define the duration of immune checkpoint inhibitors, their minimum washout period and the LT long-term safety of this strategy.

The present study aims to evaluate the feasibility of TARE in combination with Atezo/Bev for the treatment of intermediate and advanced staged HCC. METHODS: A retrospective review at a single institution was performed between May 2021 and December 2022. Patients who received TARE using yttrium-90 (Y90) with concomitant or sequential Atezo/Bev systemic treatment were included. The following outcomes were retrieved: overall survival (OS), radiologic tumor response, progression-free survival, technical adverse events related to TARE, and toxicity based on the National Cancer Institute-Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 5.0. RESULTS: Ten consecutive patients with intermediate (n ​= ​4) and advanced stage HCC (n ​= ​6) were treated with TARE and sequential/concomitant Atezo/Bev. Tumor control was achieved in all TARE-treated target lesions (100%). Overall disease progression occurred in 4 patients with PFS of 78.8% and 66.7% at 6- and 12- months, respectively. Two patients died at follow-up, with 6-month and 12-month OS rates of 90.0% and 77.1%, respectively. Three (75%) patients with intermediate stage disease were downstaged into Milan criteria. One patient developed grade 3 transaminitis and hypoglobulinemia, while Atezo/Bev was switched to Lenvatinib in another patient due to immunotherapy related myositis.

However, the safety and long-term survival outcomes of subsequent liver resection after successful conversion still remain to be validated. From February 2019 to February 2023, 726 patients were enrolled in this retrospective study (75 patients received hepatectomy after conversion therapy [CLR group], and 651 patients underwent pure hepatectomy [LR group]). Propensity score matching (PSM) was used to balance the preoperative baseline characteristics. After PSM, 68 patients in the CLR group and 124 patients in the LR group were analyzed, and all the matching variables were well-balanced. Compared with the LR group, the CLR group experienced longer Pringle maneuver time, longer operation time, and longer hospital stays. In addition, the CLR group had significantly higher incidence rates of intra-abdominal bleeding, biliary leakage, post-hepatectomy liver failure (PHLF), and Clavien-Dindo grade IIIa complications than the LR group. There were no significant statistical differences in overall survival (OS) (hazard ratio [HR] 0.724; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.356-1.474; p = 0.374) and recurrence-free survival (RFS) (HR 1.249; 95% CI 0.807-1.934; p = 0.374) between the two groups.

In recent years, its role has been evolving to include patients with disease burden beyond the widely used Milan criteria. The integration of dynamic biomarkers such as alpha-fetoprotein together with downstaging approaches and tumor evolution after enlistment has allowed the selection of patients most likely to benefit, resulting in 5-year survival rates greater that 70%. With the increasing use of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) across all stages of disease, alone or in combination with locoregional therapies, there is now the potential to further expand the patient population with HCC who may benefit from LT. This brings challenges, given the global shortage of organs and the need to better understand the optimal use of ICIs before transplantation. Furthermore, the field of transplant oncology awaits additional biomarkers that can predict those likely to benefit from ICIs.

Safety and intention-to-treat (ITT) outcomes in the peri-transplant setting are currently based on small and heterogenous single-center reports. METHODS: This first multiregional US study (2016-2023) included 117 consecutive patients with HCC assessed for liver transplantation (LT) and treated preoperatively with ICIs. ITT and survival analyses were conducted with evaluation of post-LT rejection rates. RESULTS: In total, 86 (73.5%) patients exceeded Milan criteria (MC) and 65 (75.6%) were successfully downstaged within a median of 5.6 months; 43 (36.7%) underwent transplantation, including 18 (15.4%) within MC and 23 (19.7%) who were initially beyond but were downstaged. Overall, 94% of the cohort received concurrent ICIs and locoregional therapies. No grade 4-5 adverse events occurred on the waiting list. The 3-year cumulative probability of dropout was 28% for those within MC and 48% for those beyond. Independent predictors of dropout included being beyond MC (p <0.001), alpha-fetoprotein doubling from baseline (p = 0.014) and radiographic responses (p <0.001). The 3-year ITT survival rate was 71.1% (73.5% within MC vs. 69.7% beyond MC, p = 0.329), with a 3-year post-LT survival rate of 85%. Post-LT rejection occurred in seven patients, six received their last dose of ICI less than 3 months prior to LT, resulting in one graft loss. CONCLUSIONS: The first multicenter evaluation of patients with HCC receiving ICIs pre-LT demonstrates favorable survival and safety outcomes, justifying continued utilization and further evaluation of this strategy in clinical practice. High tumor burden, doubling of alpha-fetoprotein levels, and radiographic response were identified as predictors of unfavorable oncologic outcomes. IMPACT AND IMPLICATIONS: Herein, we report results from the first multicenter evaluation of pretransplant immune checkpoint inhibitors in hepatocellular carcinoma to show promising intention-to-treat survival, safety and rejection rates. Immune checkpoint inhibitors, either alone or combined with locoregional therapy, demonstrate reliable efficacy.

Using this treatment strategy to convert HCC patients with extrahepatic metastases from unresectable to resectable has not yet been reported. METHODS: Consecutive hepatocellular carcinoma patients with extrahepatic metastases who received first-line therapy with a combination of TKIs and anti-PD-1 antibodies and at least one local regional therapy were analysed. RESULTS: Nine patients with localized disease who received first-line systemic therapy were enrolled. At baseline, all of them had oligometastatic disease, namely, Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer stage C (or Chinese Liver Cancer stage IIIB). The most common treatment administered was lenvatinib plus anti-PD-1 antibody and transarterial chemoembolization, and the median time span from systemic therapy to surgery was 3.2 (IQR, 2.8-6.2) months. Three patients achieved a pathological complete response. Six patients underwent laparoscopic surgery, and the other 3 patients underwent open surgery. After a median follow-up of 10.2 (IQR, 8.6-20.0) months, 7 patients survived without disease recurrence, and 2 experienced tumour recurrence. All patients had any-grade AEs, and 55.6% of the patients experienced grade 3 AEs. Fatigue was the most common AE, followed by elevated aminotransferase levels and hypertension.

146,Liver transplantation for hepatocellular carcinoma in India: Are we ready for 2040?,10.5500/wjt.v14.i1.88833,"BACKGROUND: Liver transplantation (LT) for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) has been widely researched and is well established worldwide. The cornerstone of this treatment lies in the various criteria formulated by expert consensus and experience. The variations among the criteria are staggering, and the short- and long-term out comes are controversial. AIM: To study the differences in the current practices of LT for HCC at different centers in India and discuss their clinical implications in the future. METHODS: We conducted a survey of major centers in India that performed LT in December 2022. A total of 23 responses were received. The centers were classified as high- and low-volume, and the current trend of care for patients und ergoing LT for HCC was noted. RESULTS: Of the 23 centers, 35% were high volume center (> 500 Liver transplants) while 52% were high-volume centers that performed more than 50 transplants/year. Approximately 39% of centers had performed > 50 LT for HCC while the percent distribution for HCC in LT patients was 5%-15% in approximately 73% of the patients. Barring a few, most centers were divided equally between University of California, San Francisco (UCSF) and center-specific criteria when choosing patients with HCC for LT, and most (65%) did not have separate transplant criteria for deceased donor LT and living donor LT (LDLT). Most centers (56%) preferred surgical resection over LT for a Child A cirrhosis patient with a resectable 4 cm HCC lesion. Positron-emission tomography-computed tomography (CT) was the modality of choice for metastatic workup in the majority of centers (74%). Downstaging was the preferred option for over 90% of the centers and included transarterial chemoembolization, transarterial radioembolization, stereotactic body radiotherapy and atezolizumab/bevacizumab with varied indications. The alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) cut-off was used by 74% of centers to decide on transplantation as well as to downstage tumors, even if they met the criteria. The criteria for successful downstaging varied, but most centers conformed to the UCSF or their center-specific criteria for LT, along with the AFP cutoff values. The wait time for LT from down staging was at least 4-6 wk in all centers. Contrast-enhanced CT was the preferred imaging modality for post-LT surveillance in 52% of the centers. Approximately 65% of the centers preferred to start everolimus between 1 and 3 months post-LT. CONCLUSION: The current predicted 5-year survival rate of HCC patients in India is less than 15%. The aim of transplantation is to achieve at least a 60% 5-year disease free survival rate, which will provide relief to the prediction of an HCC surge over the next 20 years.

Locoregional therapy (LRT) is the standard approach to bridge and downstage unresectable HCC for liver transplantation (LT). Atezolizumab-bevacizumab (atezo-bev) can induce objective responses in nearly one-third of patients; however, the role and outcomes of downstaging using atezo-bev remains unknown. METHODS: In this retrospective single-center study, we included consecutive patients between November 2020 and August 2023, who received atezo-bev with or without LRT and were subsequently considered for resection/LT after downstaging. RESULTS: Of the 115 patients who received atezo-bev, 12 patients (10.4%) achieved complete or partial response and were willing to undergo LT; they (age, 58.5 years; women, 17%; Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer stage system B/C, 5/7) had received 3-12 cycles of atezo- bev, and four of them had received prior LRT. Three patients died before LT, while three were awaiting LT. Six patients underwent curative therapies: four underwent living donor LT after a median of 79.5 days (range, 54-114) following the last atezo-bev dose, one underwent deceased donor LT 38 days after the last dose, and one underwent resection. All but one patient had complete pathologic response with no viable HCC. Three patients experienced wound healing complications, and one required re-exploration and succumbed to sepsis.

This study aimed to assess the efficacy and safety of lenvatinib combined with anti-programmed cell death-1 antibodies and transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (triple therapy) in patients with HCC and PVTT. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This retrospective multicenter study included patients with HCC and PVTT who received triple therapy, were aged between 18 and 75 years, classified as Child-Pugh class A or B, and had at least one measurable lesion. The overall survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS), objective response rates, and disease control rates were analyzed to assess efficacy. Treatment-related adverse events were analyzed to assess safety profiles. RESULTS: During a median follow-up of 11.23 months (range, 3.07 to 34.37 months), the median OS was greater than 24 months, and median PFS was 12.53 months. The 2-year OS rate was 54.9%.

ABSTRACT: Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the sixth most common malignancy worldwide. The best treatment for HCC is radical surgical resection, but 70%-80% of patients are ineligible for surgery. Although conversion therapy is an established treatment strategy for various solid tumors, there is no uniform protocol for treating HCC. In this case, we present a 69-year-old male patient diagnosed with massive HCC with Barcelona clinical liver cancer (BCLC) stage B. Because of the insufficient volume of the future liver remnant, we believed radical surgical resection was temporarily impossible. Therefore, the patient received conversion therapy, including four cycles of transcatheter arterial embolization (TAE) and hepatic arterial infusion chemotherapy (HAIC-Folfox), lenvatinib (8 mg orally once a day), and tislelizumab (an anti-PD-1 antibody, 200 mg intravenously once every 3 weeks). Fortunately, the patient achieved a good treatment response (smaller lesions and improved liver function) and underwent radical surgery finally. There was no clinical evidence of recurrence at 6 months of follow-up. For potentially resectable HCC, this case reveals that a more aggressive conversion therapy strategy (high-intensity combined with multiple treatment modalities) can be used.",Zhou Z; Xu X; Sun M; Liu Y; Liu Q; Chen C; Yin Y,False,does not meet study design criteria,patient with hepatocellular carcinoma,tislelizumab (an anti-PD-1 antibody),not specified,good treatment response and no recurrence,not a randomized controlled trial,,,,,,,,,,

Although previously established criteria, such as Milan or UCSF, have been relaxed globally to accommodate more potential recipients with comparable 5-year outcomes, there is still a subset of the population that has advanced HCC with or without portal vein tumor thrombosis without detectable extrahepatic spread who do not qualify or are unable to be downstaged by conventional methods and do not qualify for liver transplantation. Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) such as atezolizumab, pembrolizumab, or nivolumab have given hope to this group of patients. We completed a comprehensive literature review using PubMed, Google Scholar, reference citation analysis, and CrossRef. The search utilized keywords such as 'liver transplant', 'HCC', 'hepatocellular carcinoma', 'immune checkpoint inhibitors', 'ICI', 'atezolizumab', and 'nivolumab'. Several case reports have documented successful downstaging of HCC using the atezolizumab/bevacizumab combination prior to LT, with acceptable early outcomes comparable to other criteria. Adverse effects of ICI have also been reported during the perioperative period. In such cases, a 1.5-month interval between ICI therapy and LT has been suggested. Overall, the results of downstaging using combination immunotherapy were encouraging and promising. Early reports suggested a potential ray of hope for patients with CLD and advanced HCC, especially those with multifocal HCC or branch portal venous tumor thrombosis.

Conversion therapy provides patients with unresectable HCC (uHCC) the opportunity to undergo radical treatment and achieve long-term survival. Despite accumulating evidence regarding the efficacy of conversion therapy, the optimal treatment approach for such therapy remains uncertain. Lenvatinib (LEN) has shown efficacy and tolerable rates of adverse events (AEs) when applied in combination with immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) or locoregional therapy (LRT) over the past decade. Therefore, the present meta-analysis was performed to systematically assess the safety and efficacy of LEN-based treatment regimens in conversion therapies for uHCC. Data on outcomes, including the conversion rate, objective response rate (ORR), disease control rate (DCR) and AE incidence in patients with uHCC, were collected. A systematic literature search was performed using MEDLINE, Embase, Web of Science and Cochrane Library databases, up to the date of September 1, 2023. In total, 16 studies, encompassing a total of 1,650 cases of uHCC, were included in the final meta-analysis. The pooled conversion rates for LEN alone, LEN + ICI, LEN + LRT and LEN + ICI + LRT were calculated to be 0.04 (95% CI, 0.00-0.07; I(2)=77%), 0.23 (95% CI, 0.16-0.30; I(2)=66%), 0.14 (95% CI, 0.10-0.18; I(2)=0%) and 0.35 (95% CI, 0.23-0.47; I(2)=88%), respectively.

This study compared the efficacy and safety of TACE alone or combined with immune checkpoint and tyrosine kinase inhibitors. APPROACH AND RESULTS: Data were retrospectively compared for patients with initially unresectable HCC who underwent conversion therapy consisting of TACE alone (n=459) or combined with immune checkpoint and tyrosine kinase inhibitors (n=343). Compared to the group that received TACE alone, the group that received triple conversion therapy showed significantly higher rates of overall survival (HR 0.43, 95%CI 0.35-0.53). In addition, triple therapy was associated with significantly longer median progression-free survival (15.9 vs. 8.0 mo, p<0.001). These results were confirmed in matched subsets of patients from each group.

In this case report, we present the case of a patient with portal and hepatic vein cancerous thrombosis who achieved pathologic complete response after conversion therapy. CASE SUMMARY: In our center, a patient with giant HCC combined with portal vein tumor thrombus and hepatic vein tumor thrombus was treated with transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (TACE), radiotherapy, targeted therapy and immunotherapy, and was continuously given icaritin soft capsules for oral regulation. After 7 months of conversion therapy, the patient's tumor shrank and the tumor thrombus subsided significantly. The pathology of surgical resection was in complete remission, and there was no progression in the postoperative follow-up for 7 months, which provided a basis for the future strategy of combined conversion therapy. CONCLUSION: In this case, atezolizumab, bevacizumab, icaritin soft capsules combined with radiotherapy and TACE had a good effect.

However, the 5-year survival rate after LT remains low for patients with advanced HCC. Recently, combining programmed cell death protein-1 (PD-1) inhibitors with hepatic arterial infusion chemotherapy (HAIC) has achieved promising outcomes in advanced HCC treatment. However, there is a lack of sufficient clinical data demonstrating its effectiveness as a pre-LT down-staging treatment. The current study presented a case of advanced HCC beyond the Milan criteria who underwent LT and achieved a favorable outcome following PD-1 inhibitor combined with FOLFOX-HAIC therapy. Of note, due to treatment-induced tumor necrosis, precise post-treatment tumor size evaluation became challenging. To address this, circulating tumor DNA (ct-DNA) clearance was used as the LT criterion. After three cycles of Pembrolizumab and FOLFOX-HAIC therapy, the patient's serum ctDNA became undetectable and serum α-fetoprotein levels returned to normal. Magnetic resonance imaging results also revealed a significant reduction in liver tumor size post down-staging treatment. Subsequent to LT, serum ctDNA was monitored every two months, consistently yielding diminished results. There were no clinical signs of recurrence 19 months post-LT. These findings suggest that Pembrolizumab in combination with FOLFOX-HAIC may serve as a potential down-staging strategy prior to LT.

Here, we report a case series of combined SBRT and anti-PD-1 therapy in patients with unresectable HCC of large tumors. Methods: This is a retrospective case series of five patients with unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma who were treated with SBRT followed by anti-PD1 antibodies. Four patients (80%) received a single dose of TACE prior to SBRT. All patients had advanced HCC ineligible of curative intervention.

The ORR and disease control rate (DCR) across all patients received TAT-Bev-ICIs were 38.8% and 89.4%, respectively. Additionally, the pathological complete response (pCR) rate and the major pathological response (MPR) rate were 22.8% and 48.1% in the Neo-surgery group. As for safety, neoadjuvant therapy did not increase the perioperative complications when compared to direct surgery, and demonstrated similar incidences and severity of AEs when compared to the standard systemic therapy. CONCLUSION: The triple therapy regimen comprising TAT-Bev-ICIs emerged as a promising therapeutic strategy for locally advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) as a neoadjuvant intervention.",Yang Z; Wang Q; Hu L; Sima X; Wang J; Hu D; Zhou Z; Chen M; Zhang Y; Fu Y,False,"Not clearly a randomized controlled trial, although it presents multiple groups",patients with locally advanced hepatocellular carcinoma,"combination of transarterial therapy, bevacizumab, and immune checkpoint inhibitors",direct surgery and standard systemic therapy,overall survival and progression free survival,not explicitly stated as randomized controlled trial,,,,,,,,,,
