0,"Camrelizumab plus rivoceranib versus sorafenib as first-line therapy for unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (CARES-310): a randomised, open-label, international phase 3 study.",10.1016/S0140-6736(23)00961-3,"BACKGROUND: Immunotherapy with immune checkpoint inhibitors combined with an anti-angiogenic tyrosine-kinase inhibitor (TKI) has been shown to improve overall survival versus anti-angiogenic therapy alone in advanced solid tumours, but not in hepatocellular carcinoma. Therefore, a clinical study was conducted to compare the efficacy and safety of the anti-PD-1 antibody camrelizumab plus the VEGFR2-targeted TKI rivoceranib (also known as apatinib) versus sorafenib as first-line treatment for unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma. METHODS: This randomised, open-label, international phase 3 trial (CARES-310) was done at 95 study sites across 13 countries and regions worldwide. Patients with unresectable or metastatic hepatocellular carcinoma who had not previously received any systemic treatment were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive either camrelizumab 200 mg intravenously every 2 weeks plus rivoceranib 250 mg orally once daily or sorafenib 400 mg orally twice daily. Randomisation was done via a centralised interactive response system. The primary endpoints were progression-free survival, as assessed by the blinded independent review committee per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumours version 1.1, and overall survival in the intention-to-treat population. Safety was assessed in all patients who received at least one dose of the study drugs. We report the findings from the prespecified primary analysis for progression-free survival and interim analysis for overall survival. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT03764293). FINDINGS: Between June 28, 2019, and March 24, 2021, 543 patients were randomly assigned to the camrelizumab-rivoceranib (n=272) or sorafenib (n=271) group. At the primary analysis for progression-free survival (May 10, 2021), median follow-up was 7·8 months (IQR 4·1-10·6). Median progression-free survival was significantly improved with camrelizumab-rivoceranib versus sorafenib (5·6 months [95% CI 5·5-6·3] vs 3·7 months [2·8-3·7]; hazard ratio [HR] 0·52 [95% CI 0·41-0·65]; one-sided p<0·0001). At the interim analysis for overall survival (Feb 8, 2022), median follow-up was 14·5 months (IQR 9·1-18·7). Median overall survival was significantly extended with camrelizumab-rivoceranib versus sorafenib (22·1 months [95% CI 19·1-27·2] vs 15·2 months [13·0-18·5]; HR 0·62 [95% CI 0·49-0·80]; one-sided p<0·0001). The most common grade 3 or 4 treatment-related adverse events were hypertension (102 [38%] of 272 patients in the camrelizumab-rivoceranib group vs 40 [15%] of 269 patients in the sorafenib group), palmar-plantar erythrodysaesthesia syndrome (33 [12%] vs 41 [15%]), increased aspartate aminotransferase (45 [17%] vs 14 [5%]), and increased alanine aminotransferase (35 [13%] vs eight [3%]). Treatment-related serious adverse events were reported in 66 (24%) patients in the camrelizumab-rivoceranib group and 16 (6%) in the sorafenib group. Treatment-related death occurred in two patients: one patient in the camrelizumab-rivoceranib group (ie, multiple organ dysfunction syndrome) and one patient in the sorafenib group (ie, respiratory failure and circulatory collapse). INTERPRETATION: Camrelizumab plus rivoceranib showed a statistically significant and clinically meaningful benefit in progression-free survival and overall survival compared with sorafenib for patients with unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma, presenting as a new and effective first-line treatment option for this population.

1,"Lenvatinib Combined With Transarterial Chemoembolization as First-Line Treatment for Advanced Hepatocellular Carcinoma: A Phase III, Randomized Clinical Trial (LAUNCH).",10.1200/JCO.22.00392,"PURPOSE: Lenvatinib (LEN) is a first-line therapy for patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC); however, it has shown modest survival benefits. Therefore, we aimed to compare clinical outcomes of LEN combined with transarterial chemoembolization (LEN-TACE) versus LEN monotherapy in patients with advanced HCC. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This was a multicenter, randomized, open-label, parallel group, phase III trial. Patients with primary treatment-naive or initial recurrent advanced HCC after surgery were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive LEN plus on-demand TACE (LEN-TACE) or LEN monotherapy. LEN was initiated within 3 days after random assignment (initial dose: 12 mg once daily for patients ≥ 60 kg; 8 mg once daily for patients < 60 kg). TACE was initiated one day after LEN initiation. The primary end point was overall survival (OS). RESULTS: Between June 2019 and July 2021, a total of 338 patients underwent random assignment at 12 centers in China: 170 to LEN-TACE and 168 to LEN. At a prespecified event-driven interim analysis after a median follow-up of 17.0 months, the median OS was significantly longer in the LEN-TACE group (17.8 v 11.5 months; hazard ratio, 0.45; P < .001). The median progression-free survival was 10.6 months in the LEN-TACE group and 6.4 months in the LEN group (hazard ratio, 0.43; P < .001). Patients in the LEN-TACE group had a higher objective response rate according to the modified RECIST (54.1% v 25.0%, P < .001). Multivariable analysis revealed that portal vein tumor thrombus and treatment allocation were independent risk factors for OS. CONCLUSION: The addition of TACE to LEN improves clinical outcomes and is a potential first-line treatment for patients with advanced HCC.",Peng Z; Fan W; Zhu B; Wang G; Sun J; Xiao C; Huang F; Tang R; Cheng Y; Huang Z; Liang Y; Fan H; Qiao L; Li F; Zhuang W; Peng B; Wang J; Li J; Kuang M
2,"Nivolumab versus sorafenib in advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (CheckMate 459): a randomised, multicentre, open-label, phase 3 trial.",10.1016/S1470-2045(21)00604-5,"BACKGROUND: Single-agent nivolumab showed durable responses, manageable safety, and promising survival in patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma in the phase 1-2 CheckMate 040 study. We aimed to investigate nivolumab monotherapy compared with sorafenib monotherapy in the first-line setting for patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma. METHODS: In this randomised, open-label, phase 3 trial done at medical centres across 22 countries and territories in Asia, Australasia, Europe, and North America, patients at least 18 years old with histologically confirmed advanced hepatocellular carcinoma not eligible for, or whose disease had progressed after, surgery or locoregional treatment; with no previous systemic therapy for hepatocellular carcinoma, with Child-Pugh class A and Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status score of 0 or 1, and regardless of viral hepatitis status were randomly assigned (1:1) via an interactive voice response system to receive nivolumab (240 mg intravenously every 2 weeks) or sorafenib (400 mg orally twice daily) until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. The primary endpoint was overall survival assessed in the intention-to-treat population. Safety was assessed in all patients who received at least one dose of study drug. This completed trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT02576509. FINDINGS: Between Jan 11, 2016, and May 24, 2017, 743 patients were randomly assigned to treatment (nivolumab, n=371; sorafenib, n=372). At the primary analysis, the median follow-up for overall survival was 15·2 months (IQR 5·7-28·0) for the nivolumab group and 13·4 months (5·7-25·9) in the sorafenib group. Median overall survival was 16·4 months (95% CI 13·9-18·4) with nivolumab and 14·7 months (11·9-17·2) with sorafenib (hazard ratio 0·85 [95% CI 0·72-1·02]; p=0·075; minimum follow-up 22·8 months); the protocol-defined significance level of p=0·0419 was not reached. The most common grade 3 or worse treatment-related adverse events were palmar-plantar erythrodysaesthesia (1 [<1%] of 367 patients in the nivolumab group vs 52 [14%] of patients in the sorafenib group), aspartate aminotransferase increase (22 [6%] vs 13 [4%]), and hypertension (0 vs 26 [7%]). Serious treatment-related adverse events were reported in 43 (12%) patients receiving nivolumab and 39 (11%) patients receiving sorafenib. Four deaths in the nivolumab group and one death in the sorafenib group were assessed as treatment related. INTERPRETATION: First-line nivolumab treatment did not significantly improve overall survival compared with sorafenib, but clinical activity and a favourable safety profile were observed in patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma. Thus, nivolumab might be considered a therapeutic option for patients in whom tyrosine kinase inhibitors and antiangiogenic drugs are contraindicated or have substantial risks.

We aimed to compare the overall survival of patients treated with FOLFOX-HAIC versus TACE as first-line treatment in this population. METHODS: In this randomized, multicenter, open-label trial, adults with unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (largest diameter ≥ 7 cm) without macrovascular invasion or extrahepatic spread were randomly assigned 1:1 to FOLFOX-HAIC (oxaliplatin 130 mg/m(2), leucovorin 400 mg/m(2), fluorouracil bolus 400 mg/m(2) on day 1, and fluorouracil infusion 2,400 mg/m(2) for 24 hours, once every 3 weeks) or TACE (epirubicin 50 mg, lobaplatin 50 mg, and lipiodol and polyvinyl alcohol particles). The primary end point was overall survival by intention-to-treat analysis. Safety was assessed in patients who received ≥ 1 cycle of study treatment. RESULTS: Between October 1, 2016, and November 23, 2018, 315 patients were randomly assigned to FOLFOX-HAIC (n = 159) or TACE (n = 156). The median overall survival in the FOLFOX-HAIC group was 23.1 months (95% CI, 18.5 to 27.7) versus 16.1 months (95% CI, 14.3 to 17.9) in the TACE group (hazard ratio, 0.58; 95% CI, 0.45 to 0.75; P < .001). The FOLFOX-HAIC group showed a higher response rate than the TACE group (73 [46%] v 28 [18%]; P < .001) and a longer median progression-free survival (9.6 [95% CI, 7.4 to 11.9] v 5.4 months [95% CI, 3.8 to 7.0], P < .001). The incidence of serious adverse events was higher in the TACE group than in the FOLFOX-HAIC group (30% v 19%, P = .03). Two deaths in the FOLFOX-HAIC group and two in the TACE group were deemed to be treatment-related. CONCLUSION: FOLFOX-HAIC significantly improved overall survival over TACE in patients with unresectable large hepatocellular carcinoma.",Li QJ; He MK; Chen HW; Fang WQ; Zhou YM; Xu L; Wei W; Zhang YJ; Guo Y; Guo RP; Chen MS; Shi M
4,Personalized neoantigen vaccine and pembrolizumab in advanced hepatocellular carcinoma: a phase 1/2 trial.,10.1038/s41591-024-02894-y,"Programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) inhibitors have modest efficacy as a monotherapy in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). A personalized therapeutic cancer vaccine (PTCV) may enhance responses to PD-1 inhibitors through the induction of tumor-specific immunity. We present results from a single-arm, open-label, phase 1/2 study of a DNA plasmid PTCV (GNOS-PV02) encoding up to 40 neoantigens coadministered with plasmid-encoded interleukin-12 plus pembrolizumab in patients with advanced HCC previously treated with a multityrosine kinase inhibitor. Safety and immunogenicity were assessed as primary endpoints, and treatment efficacy and feasibility were evaluated as secondary endpoints. The most common treatment-related adverse events were injection-site reactions, observed in 15 of 36 (41.6%) patients. No dose-limiting toxicities or treatment-related grade ≥3 events were observed. The objective response rate (modified intention-to-treat) per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors 1.1 was 30.6% (11 of 36 patients), with 8.3% (3 of 36) of patients achieving a complete response. Clinical responses were associated with the number of neoantigens encoded in the vaccine. Neoantigen-specific T cell responses were confirmed in 19 of 22 (86.4%) evaluable patients by enzyme-linked immunosorbent spot assays. Multiparametric cellular profiling revealed active, proliferative and cytolytic vaccine-specific CD4(+) and CD8(+) effector T cells. T cell receptor β-chain (TCRβ) bulk sequencing results demonstrated vaccination-enriched T cell clone expansion and tumor infiltration. Single-cell analysis revealed posttreatment T cell clonal expansion of cytotoxic T cell phenotypes. TCR complementarity-determining region cloning of expanded T cell clones in the tumors following vaccination confirmed reactivity against vaccine-encoded neoantigens. Our results support the PTCV's mechanism of action based on the induction of antitumor T cells and show that a PTCV plus pembrolizumab has clinical activity in advanced HCC.

5,"Sequential transarterial chemoembolisation and stereotactic body radiotherapy followed by immunotherapy as conversion therapy for patients with locally advanced, unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (START-FIT): a single-arm, phase 2 trial.",10.1016/S2468-1253(22)00339-9,"BACKGROUND: The synergy between locoregional therapies and immune checkpoint inhibitors has not been investigated as conversion therapy for unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma. We aimed to investigate the activity of sequential transarterial chemoembolisation (TACE) and stereotactic body radiotherapy followed by avelumab (an anti-PD-L1 drug) for locally advanced, unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma. METHODS: START-FIT was a single-arm, phase 2 trial in patients with locally advanced hepatocellular carcinoma who were not suitable for curative treatment, conducted in two hospitals in Hong Kong and one in Shenzhen, China. Eligible patients were those aged 18 years or older with an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status 0-1, Child-Pugh liver function score A5 to B7, tumour size of at least 5 cm, a maximum of three tumour lesions, and adequate hepatic, renal, and bone marrow function. Participants received TACE on day 1, followed by stereotactic body radiotherapy (27·5-40·0 Gy in five fractions) at day 28. Avelumab (10 mg/kg) was administered 14 days following stereotactic body radiotherapy and every 2 weeks thereafter. The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients deemed amenable to curative treatment, defined as those who had a sustained complete or partial treatment response for at least 2 months and if curative treatment could be performed (ie, resection, radiofrequency ablation, or transplantation), analysed by intention to treat. Safety was also analysed in the intention-to-treat population. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT03817736) and has been completed. FINDINGS: Between March 18, 2019, and Jan 27, 2021, 33 patients (32 [97%] men and one [3%] woman) were enrolled. The median sum of the largest diameters of lesions was 15·1 cm (IQR 8·3-14·9). 21 (64%) patients had macrovascular invasion (hepatic vein [n=13], branched portal vein [n=3], or both [n=5]). Median follow-up was 17·2 months (IQR 7·8-25·8). 18 (55%) patients were deemed amenable to curative treatment: four (12%) of 33 patients had curative treatment (resection [n=2] or radiofrequency ablation [n=2]), and 14 (42%) had a radiological complete response and opted for close surveillance. 11 (33%) of 33 patients had treatment-related adverse events that were grade 3 or worse. The most common treatment-related grade 3 or worse adverse event was transient increase in alanine aminotransferase or aspartate aminotransferase (five [15%]) after TACE. Five (15%) patients developed immune-related adverse events of grade 3 or worse (three had hepatitis, two had dermatitis). INTERPRETATION: To our knowledge, this is the first prospective trial using the combination of immunotherapy and locoregional treatment as conversion therapy for locally advanced unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma, with promising results. Future randomised trials with larger cohorts of patients are warranted.

6,Randomized Phase 3 LEAP-012 Study: Transarterial Chemoembolization With or Without Lenvatinib Plus Pembrolizumab for Intermediate-Stage Hepatocellular Carcinoma Not Amenable to Curative Treatment.,10.1007/s00270-021-03031-9,"PURPOSE: Transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) is the standard of care for patients with intermediate-stage hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Lenvatinib, a multikinase inhibitor, and pembrolizumab, a PD-1 inhibitor, have shown efficacy and tolerability in patients with HCC, and adding this combination to TACE may enhance clinical benefit. PROTOCOL: LEAP-012 is a prospective, double-blind randomized phase 3 study. Adults with confirmed HCC localized to the liver without portal vein thrombosis and not amenable to curative treatment, ≥ 1 measurable tumor per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors 1.1 (RECIST 1.1), Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status 0 or 1, Child-Pugh class A and no previous systemic treatment for HCC are eligible. Patients will be randomly assigned to lenvatinib once daily plus pembrolizumab every 6 weeks plus TACE or placebos plus TACE. Dual primary endpoints are overall survival and progression-free survival per RECIST 1.1 by blinded independent central review (BICR). Secondary endpoints are progression-free survival, objective response rate, disease control rate, duration of response and time to progression per modified RECIST by BICR; objective response rate, disease control rate, duration of response and time to progression per RECIST 1.1 by BICR; and safety. STATISTICS: The planned sample size, 950 patients, was calculated to permit accumulation of sufficient overall survival events in 5 years to achieve 90% power for the overall survival primary endpoint. DISCUSSION: LEAP-012 will evaluate the clinical benefit of adding lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab to TACE in patients with intermediate-stage HCC not amenable to curative treatment.

7,(90)Y Radioembolization versus Drug-eluting Bead Chemoembolization for Unresectable Hepatocellular Carcinoma: Results from the TRACE Phase II Randomized Controlled Trial.,10.1148/radiol.211806,"Background Transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) is the recommended treatment for intermediate hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) according to the Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer guidelines. Prospective uncontrolled studies suggest that yttrium 90 ((90)Y) transarterial radioembolization (TARE) is a safe and effective alternative. Purpose To compare the efficacy and safety of TARE with TACE for unresectable HCC. Materials and Methods In this single-center prospective randomized controlled trial (TRACE), (90)Y glass TARE was compared with doxorubicin drug-eluting bead (DEB) TACE in participants with intermediate-stage HCC, extended to Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status 1 and those with early-stage HCC not eligible for surgery or thermoablation. Participants were recruited between September 2011 and March 2018. The primary end point was time to overall tumor progression (TTP) (Kaplan-Meier analysis) in the intention-to-treat (ITT) and per-protocol (PP) groups. Results At interim analysis, 38 participants (median age, 67 years; IQR, 63-72 years; 33 men) were randomized to the TARE arm and 34 (median age, 68 years; IQR, 61-71 years; 30 men) to the DEB-TACE arm (ITT group). Median TTP was 17.1 months in the TARE arm versus 9.5 months in the DEB-TACE arm (ITT group hazard ratio [HR], 0.36; 95% CI: 0.18, 0.70; P = .002) (PP group, 32 and 34 participants, respectively, in each arm; HR, 0.29; 95% CI: 0.14, 0.60; P < .001). Median overall survival was 30.2 months after TARE and 15.6 months after DEB-TACE (ITT group HR, 0.48; 95% CI: 0.28, 0.82; P = .006). Serious adverse events grade 3 or higher (13 of 33 participants [39%] vs 19 of 36 [53%] after TARE and DEB-TACE, respectively; P = .47) and 30-day mortality (0 of 33 participants [0%] vs three of 36 [8.3%]; P = .24) were similar in the safety groups. At the interim, the HR for the primary end point, TTP, was less than 0.39, meeting the criteria to halt the study. Conclusion With similar safety profile, yttrium 90 radioembolization conferred superior tumor control and survival compared with chemoembolization using drug-eluting beads in selected participants with early or intermediate hepatocellular carcinoma.

8,Single-cell immune signature for detecting early-stage HCC and early assessing anti-PD-1 immunotherapy efficacy.,10.1136/jitc-2021-003133,"BACKGROUND: The early diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) can greatly improve patients' 5-year survival rate, and the early efficacy assessment is important for oncologists to harness the anti-programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) immunotherapy in patients with advanced HCC. The lack of effective predicting biomarkers not only leads to delayed detection of the disease but also results in ineffective immunotherapy and limited clinical survival benefit. METHODS: We exploited the single-cell approach (cytometry by time of flight (CyTOF)) to analyze peripheral blood mononuclear cells from multicohorts of human samples. Immune signatures for different stages of patients with HCC were systematically profiled and statistically compared. Furthermore, the dynamic changes of peripheral immune compositions for both first-line and second-line patients with HCC after anti-PD-1 monotherapy were also evaluated and systematically compared. RESULTS: We identified stage-specific immune signatures for HCC and constructed a logistic AdaBoost-SVM classifier based on these signatures. The classifier provided superior performance in predicting early-stage HCC over the commonly used serum alpha-fetoprotein level. We also revealed the treatment stage-specific immune signatures from peripheral blood and their dynamical changing patterns, all of which were integrated to achieve early discrimination of patients with non-durable benefit for both first-line and second-line anti-PD-1 monotherapies. CONCLUSIONS: Our newly identified single-cell peripheral immune signatures provide promising non-invasive biomarkers for early detection of HCC and early assessment for anti-PD-1 immunotherapy efficacy in patients with advanced HCC. These new findings can potentially facilitate early diagnosis and novel immunotherapy for patients with HCC in future practice and further guide the utility of CyTOF in clinical translation of cancer research.

9,Uncoupling immune trajectories of response and adverse events from anti-PD-1 immunotherapy in hepatocellular carcinoma.,10.1016/j.jhep.2022.03.039,"BACKGROUND & AIMS: While immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) has shown promise in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), it is associated with modest response rates and immune-related adverse events (irAEs) are common. In this study, we aimed to decipher immune trajectories and mechanisms of response and/or irAEs in patients with HCC receiving anti-programmed cell death 1 (anti-PD-1) therapy. METHODS: Pre- and on-treatment peripheral blood samples (n = 60) obtained from 32 patients with HCC (Singapore cohort) were analysed by cytometry by time-of-flight and single-cell RNA sequencing, with flow cytometric validation in an independent Korean cohort (n = 29). Mechanistic validation was conducted by bulk RNA sequencing of 20 pre- and on-treatment tumour biopsies and using a murine HCC model treated with different immunotherapeutic combinations. RESULTS: Single-cell analyses identified CXCR3(+)CD8(+) effector memory T (T(EM)) cells and CD11c(+) antigen-presenting cells (APC) as associated with response (p = 0.0004 and 0.0255, respectively), progression-free survival (p = 0.00079 and 0.0015, respectively), and irAEs (p = 0.0034 and 0.0125, respectively) in anti-PD-1-treated patients with HCC. Type-1 conventional dendritic cells were identified as the specific APC associated with response, while 2 immunosuppressive CD14(+) myeloid clusters were linked to reduced irAEs. Further analyses of CXCR3(+)CD8(+) T(EM) cells showed cell-cell interactions specific to response vs. irAEs, from which the anti-PD-1 and anti-TNFR2 combination was harnessed to uncouple these effects, resulting in enhanced response without increased irAEs in a murine HCC model. CONCLUSIONS: This study identifies early predictors of clinical response to anti-PD-1 ICB in patients with HCC and offers mechanistic insights into the immune trajectories of these immune subsets at the interface between response and toxicity. We also propose a new combination immunotherapy for HCC to enhance response without exacerbating irAEs. CLINICAL TRIAL NUMBER: NCT03695952. LAY SUMMARY: Response rates to immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) treatment in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remain modest and adverse events are common. Herein, we identified early predictors of response and gained an in-depth understanding of the immunological mechanisms behind response and adverse events in patients with HCC treated with ICB. We also proposed a new combination immunotherapy for HCC that enhances response without exacerbating adverse events.",Chuah S; Lee J; Song Y; Kim HD; Wasser M; Kaya NA; Bang K; Lee YJ; Jeon SH; Suthen S; A'Azman S; Gien G; Lim CJ; Chua C; Hazirah SN; Lee HK; Lim JQ; Lim TKH; Yeong J; Chen J; Shin EC; Albani S; Zhai W; Yoo C; Liu H; Choo SP; Tai D; Chew V
10,Immune signatures of checkpoint inhibitor-induced autoimmunity-A focus on neurotoxicity.,10.1093/neuonc/noad198,"BACKGROUND: Neurologic immune-related adverse events (irAE-n) are rare but severe toxicities of immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) treatment. To overcome diagnostic and therapeutic challenges, a better mechanistic understanding of irAE-n is paramount. METHODS: In this observational cohort study, we collected serum and peripheral blood samples from 34 consecutive cancer patients with irAE-n (during acute illness) and 49 cancer control patients without irAE-n (pre- and on-ICI treatment, n = 44 without high-grade irAEs, n = 5 with high-grade nonneurologic irAEs). Patients received either anti-programmed cell death protein (PD)-1 or anti-PD ligand-1 monotherapy or anti-PD-1/anti-cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated protein-4 combination therapy. Most common cancers were melanoma, lung cancer, and hepatocellular carcinoma. Peripheral blood immune profiling was performed using 48-marker single-cell mass cytometry and a multiplex cytokine assay. RESULTS: During acute illness, patients with irAE-n presented higher frequencies of cluster of differentiation (CD)8+ effector memory type (EM-)1 and central memory (CM) T cells compared to controls without irAEs. Multiorgan immunotoxicities (neurologic + nonneurologic) were associated with higher CD8+ EM1 T cell counts. While there were no B cell changes in the overall cohort, we detected a marked decrease of IgD- CD11c+ CD21low and IgD- CD24+ CD21high B cells in a subgroup of patients with autoantibody-positive irAE-n. We further identified signatures indicative of enhanced chemotaxis and inflammation in irAE-n patients and discovered C-X-C motif chemokine ligand (CXCL)10 as a promising marker to diagnose high-grade immunotoxicities such as irAE-n.

11,"Efficacy and safety of camrelizumab plus apatinib during the perioperative period in resectable hepatocellular carcinoma: a single-arm, open label, phase II clinical trial.",10.1136/jitc-2022-004656,"OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to assess the efficacy and safety of camrelizumab plus apatinib in patients with resectable hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) as neoadjuvant therapy. METHODS: Initially, 20 patients with HCC were screened and 18 patients with resectable HCC were enrolled in this open-label, single-arm, phase II clinical trial. Patients received three cycles of neoadjuvant therapy including three doses of camrelizumab concurrent with apatinib for 21 days followed by surgery. Four to 8 weeks after surgery, patients received eight cycles of adjuvant therapy with camrelizumab in combination with apatinib. Major pathological reactions (MPR), complete pathological reactions (pCR), objective response rate (ORR), relapse-free survival (RFS), and adverse events (AE) were assessed. In addition, cancer tissue and plasma samples were collected before and after treatment, and genetic differences between responding and non-responding lesions were compared by tumor immune microenvironment (TIME) analysis, circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) analysis and proteomics analysis. RESULTS: In 18 patients with HCC who completed neoadjuvant therapy, 3 (16.7%) and 6 (33.3%) patients with HCC reached ORR based on Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) V.1.1 and modified RECIST criteria, respectively. Of the 17 patients with HCC who received surgical resection, 3 (17.6%) patients with HCC reported MPR and 1 (5.9%) patient with HCC achieved pCR. The 1-year RFS rate of the enrolled patients was 53.85% (95% CI: 24.77% to 75.99%). Grade 3/4 AEs were reported in 3 (16.7%) of the 18 patients, with the most common AEs being rash (11.1%), hypertension (5.6%), drug-induced liver damage (5.6%), and neutropenia (5.6%) in the preoperative phase. The 289 NanoString panel RNA sequencing showed that TIME cell infiltration especially dendritic cells (DCs) infiltration was better in responding tumors than in non-responding tumors. Our results of ctDNA revealed a higher positive rate (100%) among patients with HCC with stage IIb-IIIa disease. When comparing patients with pCR/MPR and non-MPR, we observed more mutations in patients who achieved pCR/MPR at baseline (6 mutations vs 2.5 mutations, p=0.025). Patients who were ctDNA positive after adjuvant therapy presented a trend of shorter RFS than those who were ctDNA negative. Proteomic analysis suggested that abnormal glucose metabolism in patients with multifocal HCC might be related to different sensitivity of treatment in different lesions. CONCLUSION: Perioperative camrelizumab plus apatinib displays a promising efficacy and manageable toxicity in patients with resectable HCC. DCs infiltration might be a predictive marker of response to camrelizumab and apatinib as well as patients' recurrence. ctDNA as a compose biomarker can predict pathological response and relapse. Abnormal glucose metabolism in patients with multifocal HCC may be related to different sensitivity of treatment in different lesions.

12,"Neoadjuvant cemiplimab for resectable hepatocellular carcinoma: a single-arm, open-label, phase 2 trial.",10.1016/S2468-1253(21)00385-X,"BACKGROUND: Surgical resection of early stage hepatocellular carcinoma is standard clinical practice; however, most tumours recur despite surgery, and no perioperative intervention has shown a survival benefit. Neoadjuvant immunotherapy has induced pathological responses in multiple tumour types and might decrease the risk of postoperative recurrence in hepatocellular carcinoma. We aimed to evaluate the clinical activity of neoadjuvant cemiplimab (an anti-PD-1) in patients with resectable hepatocellular carcinoma. METHODS: For this single-arm, open-label, phase 2 trial, patients with resectable hepatocellular carcinoma (stage Ib, II, and IIIb) were enrolled and received two cycles of neoadjuvant cemiplimab 350 mg intravenously every 3 weeks followed by surgical resection. Eligible patients were aged 18 years or older, had confirmed resectable hepatocellular carcinoma, an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0 or 1, and adequate liver function. Patients were excluded if they had metastatic disease, if the surgery was not expected to be curative, if they had a known additional malignancy requiring active treatment, or if they required systemic steroid treatment or any other immunosuppressive therapy. After resection, patients received an additional eight cycles of cemiplimab 350 mg intravenously every 3 weeks in the adjuvant setting. The primary endpoint was significant tumour necrosis on pathological examination (defined as >70% necrosis of the resected tumour). Secondary endpoints included delay of surgery, the proportion of patients with an overall response, change in CD8(+) T-cell density, and adverse events. Tumour necrosis and response were analysed in all patients who received at least one dose of cemiplimab and completed surgical resection; safety and other endpoints were analysed in the intention-to-treat population. Patients underwent pre-treatment biopsies and blood collection throughout treatment. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT03916627, Cohort B) and is ongoing. FINDINGS: Between Aug 5, 2019, and Nov 25, 2020, 21 patients were enrolled. All patients received neoadjuvant cemiplimab, and 20 patients underwent successful resection. Of the 20 patients with resected tumours, four (20%) had significant tumour necrosis. Three (15%) of 20 patients had a partial response, and all other patients maintained stable disease. 20 (95%) patients had a treatment-emergent adverse event of any grade during the neoadjuvant treatment period. The most common adverse events of any grade were increased aspartate aminotransferase (in four patients), increased blood creatine phosphokinase (in three), constipation (in three), and fatigue (in three). Seven patients had grade 3 adverse events, including increased blood creatine phosphokinase (in two patients) and hypoalbuminaemia (in one). No grade 4 or 5 events were observed. One patient developed pneumonitis, which led to a delay in surgery by 2 weeks. INTERPRETATION: This report is, to our knowledge, the largest clinical trial of a neoadjuvant anti-PD-1 monotherapy reported to date in hepatocellular carcinoma. The observed pathological responses to cemiplimab in this cohort support the design of larger trials to identify the optimal treatment duration and definitively establish the clinical benefit of preoperative PD-1 blockade in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma.

13,"Lenvatinib plus anti-PD-1 antibodies as conversion therapy for patients with unresectable intermediate-advanced hepatocellular carcinoma: a single-arm, phase II trial.",10.1136/jitc-2023-007366,"BACKGROUND: Over 70% of the patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) are diagnosed at an advanced stage and lose the opportunity for radical surgery. Combination therapy of tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) and anti-programmed cell death protein-1 (PD-1) antibodies has achieved a high tumor response rate in both the first-line and second-line treatment of advanced HCC. However, few studies have prospectively evaluated whether TKIs plus anti-PD-1 antibodies could convert unresectable intermediate-advanced HCC into resectable disease. METHODS: This single-arm, phase II study enrolled systemic therapy-naïve adult patients with unresectable Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer stage B or C HCC. Patients received oral lenvatinib one time per day plus intravenous anti-PD-1 agents every 3 weeks (one cycle). Tumor response and resectability were evaluated before the fourth cycle, then every two cycles. The primary endpoint was conversion success rate by investigator assessment. Secondary endpoints included objective response rate (ORR) by independent imaging review (IIR) assessment per modified RECIST (mRECIST) and Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors, V.1.1 (RECIST 1.1), progression-free survival (PFS) and 12-month recurrence-free survival (RFS) rate by IIR per mRECIST, R0 resection rate, overall survival (OS), and safety. Biomarkers were assessed as exploratory objectives. RESULTS: Of the 56 eligible patients enrolled, 53 (94.6%) had macrovascular invasion, and 16 (28.6%) had extrahepatic metastasis. The median follow-up was 23.5 months. The primary endpoint showed a conversion success rate of 55.4% (31/56). ORR was 53.6% per mRECIST and 44.6% per RECIST 1.1. Median PFS was 8.9 months, and median OS was 23.9 months. Among the 31 successful conversion patients, 21 underwent surgery with an R0 resection rate of 85.7%, a pathological complete response rate of 38.1%, and a 12-month RFS rate of 47.6%. Grade ≥3 treatment-related adverse events were observed in 42.9% of patients. Tumor immune microenvironment analysis of pretreatment samples displayed significant enrichment of CD8(+) T cells (p=0.03) in responders versus non-responders. CONCLUSION: Lenvatinib plus anti-PD-1 antibodies demonstrate promising efficacy and tolerable safety as conversion therapy in unresectable HCC. Pre-existing CD8(+) cells are identified as a promising biomarker for response to this regimen. TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: Chinese Clinical Trial Registry, ChiCTR1900023914. commercial re-use.

14,Hepatocellular carcinoma patients with high circulating cytotoxic T cells and intra-tumoral immune signature benefit from pembrolizumab: results from a single-arm phase 2 trial.,10.1186/s13073-021-00995-8,"BACKGROUND: A limited number of studies have characterized genomic properties of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients in response to anti-PD-1 immunotherapy. METHODS: Herein, we performed comprehensive molecular characterization of immediate (D-42 to D-1) pre-treatment tumor biopsy specimens from 60 patients with sorafenib-failed HCC in a single-arm prospective phase II trial of pembrolizumab. Objective response rate was the primary efficacy endpoint. We used whole-exome sequencing, RNA sequencing, and correlative analysis. In addition, we performed single-cell RNA sequencing using peripheral blood mononuclear cells. RESULTS: The overall response rate of pembrolizumab in sorafenib-failed HCC patients was 10% ([6/60] 95% CI, 2.4-17.6). In a univariate analysis using clinicopathological features, female gender, PD-L1 positivity, and low neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) were identified as contributing factors to pembrolizumab response. Somatic mutations in CTNNB1 and genomic amplifications in MET were found only in non-responders. Transcriptional profiles through RNA sequencing identified that pembrolizumab responders demonstrated T cell receptor (TCR) signaling activation with expressions of MHC genes, indicating increased levels of T cell cytotoxicity. In single-cell sequencing from 10 pre- and post-treatment peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), patients who achieved a partial response or stable disease exhibited immunological shifts toward cytotoxic CD8+ T cells. Conversely, patients with progressive disease showed an increased number of both CD14+ and CD16+ monocytes and activation of neutrophil-associated pathways. CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, HCC patients with infiltration of cytotoxic T cells, along with increased active circulating CD8+ T cells during pembrolizumab treatment and down-regulation of neutrophil-associated markers, significantly benefited from pembrolizumab treatment.

The multicenter, single-arm, phase 2 RENOBATE trial tested regorafenib-nivolumab as front-line treatment for uHCC. Forty-two patients received nivolumab 480 mg every 4 weeks and regorafenib 80 mg daily (3-weeks-on/1-week-off schedule). The primary endpoint was the investigator-assessed objective response rate (ORR) per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) version 1.1. The secondary endpoints included safety, progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS). ORR per RECIST version 1.1 was 31.0%, meeting the primary endpoint. The most common adverse events were palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia syndrome (38.1%), alopecia (26.2%) and skin rash (23.8%). Median PFS was 7.38 months. The 1-year OS rate was 80.5%, and the median OS was not reached. Exploratory single-cell RNA sequencing analyses of peripheral blood mononuclear cells showed that long-term responders exhibited T cell receptor repertoire diversification, enrichment of genes representing immunotherapy responsiveness in MKI67(+) proliferating CD8(+) T cells and a higher probability of M1-directed monocyte polarization. Our data support further clinical development of the regorafenib-nivolumab combination as front-line treatment for uHCC and provide preliminary insights on immune biomarkers of response.

16,Nivolumab in sorafenib-naive and sorafenib-experienced patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma: 5-year follow-up from CheckMate 040.,10.1016/j.annonc.2023.12.008,"BACKGROUND: Patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (aHCC) have a poor prognosis and high mortality. Nivolumab monotherapy demonstrated clinical benefit with an acceptable safety profile in patients with aHCC in the CheckMate 040 study. Five-year follow-up of the sorafenib-naive and sorafenib-experienced groups of CheckMate 040 is presented here. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients received nivolumab monotherapy at dose levels of 0.1-10.0 mg/kg (dose-escalation phase) or 3 mg/kg (dose-expansion phase) every 2 weeks until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Primary endpoints were safety and tolerability (dose escalation), and objective response rate (ORR) by blinded independent central review (BICR) and by investigator as per RECIST version 1.1 (dose expansion). RESULTS: Eighty sorafenib-naive and 154 sorafenib-experienced patients were treated. Minimum follow-up in both groups was 60 months. ORR as per BICR was 20% [95% confidence interval (CI) 12% to 30%] and 14% (95% CI 9% to 21%) in the sorafenib-naive and sorafenib-experienced groups, respectively. Responses occurred regardless of HCC etiology or baseline tumor cell programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression levels. Median overall survival (OS) was 26.6 months (95% CI 16.6-30.6 months) and 15.1 months (95% CI 13.0-18.2 months) in sorafenib-naive and sorafenib-experienced patients, respectively. The 3-year OS rates were 28% in the sorafenib-naive and 20% in the sorafenib-experienced groups; 5-year OS rates were 14% and 12%, respectively. No new safety signals were identified; grade 3/4 treatment-related adverse events were observed in 33% and 21% of patients in the sorafenib-naive and sorafenib-experienced groups, respectively. Biomarker analyses showed that baseline PD-L1 expression ≥1% was associated with higher ORR and longer OS compared with PD-L1 <1%. In the sorafenib-naive group, patients with OS ≥3 years exhibited higher baseline CD8 T-cell density compared with those with OS <1 year. CONCLUSION: With 5 years of follow-up, nivolumab monotherapy continued to provide durable clinical benefit with manageable safety in sorafenib-naive and sorafenib-experienced patients with aHCC.",El-Khoueiry AB; Trojan J; Meyer T; Yau T; Melero I; Kudo M; Hsu C; Kim TY; Choo SP; Kang YK; Yeo W; Chopra A; Soleymani S; Yao J; Neely J; Tschaika M; Welling TH; Sangro B
17,"Perioperative nivolumab monotherapy versus nivolumab plus ipilimumab in resectable hepatocellular carcinoma: a randomised, open-label, phase 2 trial.",10.1016/S2468-1253(21)00427-1,"BACKGROUND: Hepatocellular carcinoma has high recurrence rates after surgery; however, there are no approved standard-of-care neoadjuvant or adjuvant therapies. Immunotherapy has been shown to improve survival in advanced hepatocellular carcinoma; we therefore aimed to evaluate the safety and tolerability of perioperative immunotherapy in resectable hepatocellular carcinoma. METHODS: In this single-centre, randomised, open-label, phase 2 trial, patients with resectable hepatocellular carcinoma were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive 240 mg of nivolumab intravenously every 2 weeks (for up to three doses before surgery at 6 weeks) followed in the adjuvant phase by 480 mg of nivolumab intravenously every 4 weeks for 2 years, or 240 mg of nivolumab intravenously every 2 weeks (for up to three doses before surgery) plus one dose of 1 mg/kg of ipilimumab intravenously concurrently with the first preoperative dose of nivolumab, followed in the adjuvant phase by 480 mg of nivolumab intravenously every 4 weeks for up to 2 years plus 1 mg/kg of ipilimumab intravenously every 6 weeks for up to four cycles. Patients were randomly assigned to the treatment groups by use of block randomisation with a random block size. The primary endpoint was the safety and tolerability of nivolumab with or without ipilimumab. Secondary endpoints were the proportion of patients with an overall response, time to progression, and progression-free survival. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT03222076) and is completed. FINDINGS: Between Oct 30, 2017, and Dec 3, 2019, 30 patients were enrolled and 27 were randomly assigned: 13 to nivolumab and 14 to nivolumab plus ipilimumab. Grade 3-4 adverse events were higher with nivolumab plus ipilimumab (six [43%] of 14 patients) than with nivolumab alone (three [23%] of 13). The most common treatment-related adverse events of any grade were increased alanine aminotransferase (three [23%] of 13 patients on nivolumab vs seven [50%] of 14 patients on nivolumab plus ipilimumab) and increased aspartate aminotransferase (three [23%] vs seven [50%]). No patients in either group had their surgery delayed due to grade 3 or worse adverse events. Seven of 27 patients had surgical cancellations, but none was due to treatment-related adverse events. Estimated median progression-free survival was 9·4 months (95% CI 1·47-not estimable [NE]) with nivolumab and 19·53 months (2·33-NE) with nivolumab plus ipilimumab (hazard ratio [HR] 0·99, 95% CI 0·31-2·54); median time to progression was 9·4 months (95% CI 1·47-NE) in the nivolumab group and 19·53 months (2·33-NE) in the nivolumab plus ipilimumab group (HR 0·89, 95% CI 0·31-2·54). In an exploratory analysis, three (23%) of 13 patients had an overall response with nivolumab monotherapy, versus none with nivolumab plus ipilimumab. Three (33%) of nine patients had a major pathological response (ie, ≥70% necrosis in the resected tumour area) with nivolumab monotherapy compared with three (27%) of 11 with nivolumab plus ipilimumab. INTERPRETATION: Perioperative nivolumab alone and nivolumab plus ipilimumab appears to be safe and feasible in patients with resectable hepatocellular carcinoma. Our findings support further studies of immunotherapy in the perioperative setting in hepatocellular carcinoma.

This study evaluated the pharmacokinetics, exposure-response, and exposure-pharmacodynamics relationships of tremelimumab in patients with unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (uHCC). PATIENTS AND METHODS: A previous tremelimumab population pharmacokinetic model was validated using data from parts 2 and 3 of Study 22. Exposure-response analyses explored relationships of tremelimumab exposure with efficacy and safety. Pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics relationships were evaluated using linear and nonlinear regression models. RESULTS: The observed pharmacokinetics of tremelimumab in uHCC were consistent with predictions; no significant covariates were identified. Tremelimumab exposure was not significantly associated with adverse events, objective response rate, or progression-free survival. Overall survival (OS) was longer for patients with tremelimumab exposure, minimum serum drug concentration (Cmin1) ≥ median versus Cmin1 < median (18.99 months vs. 10.97 months), but this exposure-survival analysis might be confounded with baseline characteristics of albumin level and neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio, which had a significant impact on OS (P = 0.0004 and 0.0001, respectively). The predicted Cmin1 of tremelimumab in STRIDE regimen (12.9 μg/mL) was greater than the estimated concentration of tremelimumab eliciting half-maximal increases (EC50 = 5.24 μg/mL) in CD8+Ki67+ T-cell counts. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings support novel insights into tremelimumab pharmacokinetics and exposure-response relationships in HCC and support the clinical utility of the STRIDE regimen in patients with uHCC.",Song X; Kelley RK; Khan AA; Standifer N; Zhou D; Lim K; Krishna R; Liu L; Wang K; McCoon P; Negro A; He P; Gibbs M; Kurland JF; Abou-Alfa GK

20,"Adjuvant sintilimab in resected high-risk hepatocellular carcinoma: a randomized, controlled, phase 2 trial.",10.1038/s41591-023-02786-7,"Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), particularly when accompanied by microvascular invasion (MVI), has a markedly high risk of recurrence after liver resection. Adjuvant immunotherapy is considered a promising avenue. This multicenter, open-label, randomized, controlled, phase 2 trial was conducted at six hospitals in China to assess the efficacy and safety of adjuvant sintilimab, a programmed cell death protein 1 inhibitor, in these patients. Eligible patients with HCC with MVI were randomized (1:1) into the sintilimab or active surveillance group. The sintilimab group received intravenous injections every 3 weeks for a total of eight cycles. The primary endpoint was recurrence-free survival (RFS) in the intention-to-treat population. Key secondary endpoints included overall survival (OS) and safety. From September 1, 2020, to April 23, 2022, a total of 198 eligible patients were randomly allocated to receive adjuvant sintilimab (n = 99) or undergo active surveillance (n = 99). After a median follow-up of 23.3 months, the trial met the prespecified endpoints. Sintilimab significantly prolonged RFS compared to active surveillance (median RFS, 27.7 versus 15.5 months; hazard ratio 0.534, 95% confidence interval 0.360-0.792; P = 0.002). Further follow-up is needed to confirm the difference in OS. In the sintilimab group, 12.4% of patients experienced grade 3 or 4 treatment-related adverse events, the most common of which were elevated alanine aminotransferase levels (5.2%) and anemia (4.1%).

21,A Phase I Study of Locoregional High-Dose Autologous Natural Killer Cell Therapy With Hepatic Arterial Infusion Chemotherapy in Patients With Locally Advanced Hepatocellular Carcinoma.,10.3389/fimmu.2022.879452,"BACKGROUND: To explore the feasibility and safety of natural killer (NK) cell therapy in HCC, we performed a prospective, open-label, phase I trial to evaluate the synergistic effect of locoregional high-dose autologous NK cell therapy in combination with hepatic arterial infusion chemotherapy (HAIC). METHODS: Patients with locally advanced HCC who were refractory to the standard treatment were eligible for this study. Patients received expanded and activated NK cells for 5 consecutive days in a dose-escalating manner (dose 2.5×10(8), 5×10(8), 10×10(8) NK cells/injection) through hepatic arterial infusion following 4 cycles of HAIC with 5-fluorouracil (750 mg/m(2)) and cisplatin (25 mg/m(2)). The primary endpoint was the safety of NK cell-based immunotherapy, and the secondary endpoints were objective response rate (ORR), progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), and immunologic responses. RESULTS: Of the 11 patients enrolled, the confirmed ORR was 63.6% (complete response [CR]: 36.4%, confirmed partial response [PR]: 27.3%). Stable disease (SD) and progressive disease (PD) were observed in two patients (18.2%) each, resulting in a disease control rate (DCR) of 81.8%. The median PFS and OS were 10.3 and 41.6 months, respectively. There were no incidences of decompensation or severe adverse events during HAIC, and no adverse events related to NK cell infusion were noted. CONCLUSION: The combination of HAIC and locoregional high-dose NK cell therapy is a safe and effective treatment for locally advanced HCC patients who were refractory to the standard treatment. This result warrants further development of this novel treatment to establish its efficacy in HCC.

Overall, 68.9% had Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer C-stage HCC with portal vein tumour thrombosis (PVTT, 35%) and extrahepatic spread (EHS, 51.7%). After a median follow-up of 10.0 months (95% confidence interval (CI): 9.4-10.4), median OS and PFS were 15.7 (95% CI: 14.5-NE) and 6.9 months (95% CI: 6.1-8.3), respectively. In the response-evaluable patients (n = 273), overall response rate was 30.8%. Overall, 221 patients (74.6%) developed TRAEs, with 70 (23.6%) reporting grade 3 or higher TRAEs; 25 (8.4%) patients had bleeding events. OS was independently associated with baseline Albumin-bilirubin (ALBI) grade and PVTT. Shorter PFS was associated with AFP≥ 400 ng/ml, worse ALBI and presence of EHS. CONCLUSION: This global observational study confirms the reproducible safety and efficacy of atezolizumab plus bevacizumab in routine clinical practice. Within Child-Pugh-A criteria, the presence of PVTT and higher ALBI grade identify patients with poorer survival.",Fulgenzi CAM; Cheon J; D'Alessio A; Nishida N; Ang C; Marron TU; Wu L; Saeed A; Wietharn B; Cammarota A; Pressiani T; Personeni N; Pinter M; Scheiner B; Balcar L; Napolitano A; Huang YH; Phen S; Naqash AR; Vivaldi C; Salani F; Masi G; Bettinger D; Vogel A; Schönlein M; von Felden J; Schulze K; Wege H; Galle PR; Kudo M; Rimassa L; Singal AG; Sharma R; Cortellini A; Gaillard VE; Chon HJ; Pinato DJ
23,A Phase I/IIa Trial of Yttrium-90 Radioembolization in Combination with Durvalumab for Locally Advanced Unresectable Hepatocellular Carcinoma.,10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-23-0581,"PURPOSE: Synergistic effect of radiotherapy and immunotherapy for the treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) has been reported. This phase I/IIa pilot trial evaluated preliminary efficacy and safety of combination of radioembolization with yttrium-90 microspheres (Y90-radioembolization) and durvalumab in patients with locally advanced unresectable HCC. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients with Child-Pugh score ≤ 7 and locally advanced HCC, defined as Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC) stage B HCC or BCLC-C disease without extrahepatic metastases, received Y90-radioembolization followed by intravenous durvalumab 1,500 mg 7 to 14 days after Y90-radioembolization and every 4 weeks thereafter. Primary endpoint was time to progression (TTP) assessed by modified RECIST (mRECIST). Secondary endpoints included overall survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS), objective response rate (ORR) determined by mRECIST, and safety. RESULTS: All 24 patients enrolled received Y90-radioembolization and 23 received at least one dose of durvalumab. Median follow-up duration was 19.0 months (range, 2.2-24.2). Median TTP was 15.2 months [95% confidence interval (CI), 6.1-not estimated]. Median OS was not reached and 18-month OS rate was 58.3% (95% CI, 36.4-75.0). Median PFS was 6.9 months (95% CI, 5.4-15.2). Seven (29.2%) patients had a complete response and 13 (54.2%) had a partial response; ORR was 83.3% (95% CI, 62.6-95.3). Eleven (47.8%) patients experienced any-grade treatment-related adverse events. Two (8.7%) patients had grade 3 treatment-related adverse events (neutropenia and fever). None experienced any treatment-related serious adverse events. CONCLUSIONS: In patients with locally advanced unresectable HCC, the combination of Y90-radioembolization and durvalumab demonstrated promising efficacy and safety, warranting further evaluation in large-scale controlled trials.",Lee YB; Nam JY; Cho EJ; Lee JH; Yu SJ; Kim HC; Paeng JC; Yoon JH; Kim YJ
24,Survival in Patients With Recurrent Intermediate-Stage Hepatocellular Carcinoma: Sorafenib Plus TACE vs TACE Alone Randomized Clinical Trial.,10.1001/jamaoncol.2024.1831,"IMPORTANCE: Transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) is commonly used to treat patients with recurrent intermediate-stage hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and positive microvascular invasion (MVI); however, TACE alone has demonstrated unsatisfactory survival benefits. A previous retrospective study suggested that TACE plus sorafenib (SOR-TACE) may be a better therapeutic option compared with TACE alone. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the clinical outcomes of SOR-TACE vs TACE alone for patients with recurrent intermediate-stage HCC after R0 hepatectomy with positive MVI. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: In this phase 3, open-label, multicenter randomized clinical trial, patients with recurrent intermediate-stage HCC and positive MVI were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio via a computerized minimization technique to either SOR-TACE treatment or TACE alone. This trial was conducted at 5 hospitals in China, and enrolled patients from October 2019 to December 2021, with a follow-up period of 24 months. Data were analyzed from June 2023 to September 2023. INTERVENTIONS: Randomization to on-demand TACE (conventional TACE: doxorubicin, 50 mg, mixed with lipiodol and gelatin sponge particles [diameter: 150-350 μm]; drug-eluting bead TACE: doxorubicin, 75 mg, mixed with drug-eluting particles [diameter: 100-300 μm or 300-500 μm]) (TACE group) or sorafenib, 400 mg, twice daily plus on-demand TACE (SOR-TACE group) (conventional TACE: doxorubicin, 50 mg, mixed with lipiodol and gelatin sponge particles [diameter, 150-350 μm]; drug-eluting bead TACE: doxorubicin, 75 mg, mixed with drug-eluting particles [diameter: 100-300 μm or 300-500 μm]). MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary end point was overall survival by intention-to-treat analysis. Safety was assessed in patients who received at least 1 dose of study treatment. RESULTS: A total of 162 patients (median [range] age, 55 [28-75] years; 151 males [93.2%]), were randomly assigned to be treated with either SOR-TACE (n = 81) or TACE alone (n = 81). The median overall survival was significantly longer in the SOR-TACE group than in the TACE group (22.2 months vs 15.1 months; hazard ratio [HR], 0.55; P < .001). SOR-TACE also prolonged progression-free survival (16.2 months vs 11.8 months; HR, 0.54; P < .001), and improved the objective response rate when compared with TACE alone based on the modified Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors criteria (80.2% vs 58.0%; P = .002). Any grade adverse events were more common in the SOR-TACE group, but all adverse events responded well to treatment. No unexpected adverse events or treatment-related deaths occurred in this study. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: The results of this randomized clinical trial demonstrated that SOR-TACE achieved better clinical outcomes than TACE alone. These findings suggest that combined treatment should be used for patients with recurrent intermediate-stage HCC after R0 hepatectomy with positive MVI.

25,Treatment of localized hepatocellular carcinoma: resection vs. ablation vs. radiation.,10.21037/apm-23-486,"Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a common malignancy with many patients presenting with local disease. As of date, the use of radiation is not included in the commonly utilized Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC) classification but is in the National Comprehensive Cancer Network guidelines. Radiation can volumetrically cover the entire tumor and with novel technologic advances can be administered non-invasively with excellent clinical outcomes with few adverse events. The gold standard for localized early HCC (such as BCLC-A) is resection or transplantation. In patients who are not candidates for surgical treatment, locoregional therapy should be considered as an optimal therapy for these patients. Tumor ablation techniques such as microwave ablation (MWA) and radiofrequency ablation (RFA) are excellent tools to control local disease or bridge to transplantation. Should these not be possible though then ablation with external beam radiation is also capable of yielding comparable local control and serve as a bridge to transplant without worse rates of adverse events. For tumors that meet Milan criteria for transplantation, in comparison to transarterial chemoembolization (TACE), there is considerable randomized evidence demonstrating better local control, less adverse events, better progression-free survival (PFS), and less costly. It can be utilized as a bridge in Barcelona liver class B. For larger localized tumors though (extrahepatic disease or vascular invasion like BCLC-C), stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) is shown via a randomized clinical trial to have a survival benefit, local control benefit, and no worse adverse events compared to systemic therapy. In this setting, it should be considered the local consolidation standard of care.",Anderson C; Chin HM; Hoverson J; Court C; Wagner T; Newman NB
26,"CD8-Targeted PET Imaging of Tumor-Infiltrating T Cells in Patients with Cancer: A Phase I First-in-Humans Study of (89)Zr-Df-IAB22M2C, a Radiolabeled Anti-CD8 Minibody.",10.2967/jnumed.121.262485,"There is a need for in vivo diagnostic imaging probes that can noninvasively measure tumor-infiltrating CD8+ leukocytes. Such imaging probes could be used to predict early response to cancer immunotherapy, help select effective single or combination immunotherapies, and facilitate the development of new immunotherapies or immunotherapy combinations. This study was designed to optimize conditions for performing CD8 PET imaging with (89)Zr-Df-IAB22M2C and determine whether CD8 PET imaging could provide a safe and effective noninvasive method of visualizing the whole-body biodistribution of CD8+ leukocytes. Methods: We conducted a phase 1 first-in-humans PET imaging study using an anti-CD8 radiolabeled minibody, (89)Zr-Df-IAB22M2C, to detect whole-body and tumor CD8+ leukocyte distribution in patients with metastatic solid tumors. Patients received 111 MBq of (89)Zr-Df-IAB22M2C followed by serial PET scanning over 5-7 d. A 2-stage design included a dose-escalation phase and a dose-expansion phase. Biodistribution, radiation dosimetry, and semiquantitative evaluation of (89)Zr-Df-IAB22M2C uptake were performed in all patients. Results: Fifteen subjects with metastatic melanoma, non-small cell lung cancer, and hepatocellular carcinoma were enrolled. No drug-related adverse events or abnormal laboratory results were noted except for a transient increase in antidrug antibodies in 1 subject. (89)Zr-Df-IAB22M2C accumulated in tumors and CD8-rich tissues (e.g., spleen, bone marrow, nodes), with maximum uptake at 24-48 h after injection and low background activity in CD8-poor tissues (e.g., muscle and lung). Radiotracer uptake in tumors was noted in 10 of 15 subjects, including 7 of 8 subjects on immunotherapy, 1 of 2 subjects on targeted therapy, and 2 of 5 treatment-naïve subjects. In 3 patients with advanced melanoma or hepatocellular carcinoma on immunotherapy, posttreatment CD8 PET/CT scans demonstrated increased (89)Zr-Df-IAB22M2C uptake in tumor lesions, which correlated with response. Conclusion: CD8 PET imaging with (89)Zr-Df-IAB22M2C is safe and has the potential to visualize the whole-body biodistribution of CD8+ leukocytes in tumors and reference tissues, and may predict early response to immunotherapy.",Farwell MD; Gamache RF; Babazada H; Hellmann MD; Harding JJ; Korn R; Mascioni A; Le W; Wilson I; Gordon MS; Wu AM; Ulaner GA; Wolchok JD; Postow MA; Pandit-Taskar N
27,Laparoscopic liver resection versus radiofrequency ablation for small hepatocellular carcinoma: randomized clinical trial.,10.1093/bjs/znae099,"BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to compare the efficacy of laparoscopic liver resection versus radiofrequency ablation for treatment of small hepatocellular carcinoma. METHODS: This single-centre RCT was conducted at a tertiary referral centre in China. Patients with small hepatocellular carcinoma who had a single nodule no larger than 5 cm, or up to three nodules of 3 cm or smaller, were eligible. Patients were assigned randomly in a 1 : 1 ratio to either laparoscopic liver resection or radiofrequency ablation. Blinding was not attempted. Sample size calculations led to 75 patients per group. The primary outcome was overall survival, and the secondary outcome was recurrence-free survival. RESULTS: Seventy-five patients were included in each group. Overall survival (HR 1.26, 95% c.i. 0.69 to 2.30; P = 0.451) and recurrence-free survival (HR 1.34, 0.86 to 2.08; P = 0.189) did not differ between the resection and ablation groups. The 1-, 3- and 5-year overall survival rates were 94.7, 80.0, and 74.7% respectively after laparoscopic liver resection versus 93.3, 78.7, and 67.9% after radiofrequency ablation. Corresponding recurrence-free survival rates were 78.7, 61.3, and 51.6%, and 69.3, 53.3, and 41.0%, respectively. CONCLUSION: For small hepatocellular carcinoma, percutaneous radiofrequency ablation provides therapeutic effects similar to those of laparoscopic liver resection.

28,Nivolumab plus ipilimumab combination therapy in patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma previously treated with sorafenib: 5-year results from CheckMate 040.,10.1016/j.annonc.2024.03.005,"BACKGROUND: Nivolumab plus ipilimumab demonstrated promising clinical activity and durable responses in sorafenib-treated patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in the CheckMate 040 study at 30.7-month median follow-up. Here, we present 5-year results from this cohort. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients were randomized 1 : 1 : 1 to arm A [nivolumab 1 mg/kg plus ipilimumab 3 mg/kg Q3W (four doses)] or arm B [nivolumab 3 mg/kg plus ipilimumab 1 mg/kg Q3W (four doses)], each followed by nivolumab 240 mg Q2W, or arm C (nivolumab 3 mg/kg Q2W plus ipilimumab 1 mg/kg Q6W). The primary objectives were safety, tolerability, investigator-assessed objective response rate (ORR), and duration of response (DOR) per RECIST version 1.1. RESULTS: A total of 148 patients were randomized across treatment arms. At 60-month minimum follow-up (62.6-month median follow-up), the ORR was 34% (n = 17), 27% (n = 13), and 29% (n = 14) in arms A, B, and C, respectively. The median DOR was 51.2 months [95% confidence interval (CI) 12.6 months-not estimable (NE)], 15.2 months (95% CI 7.1 months-NE), and 21.7 months (95% CI 4.2 months-NE), respectively. The median overall survival (OS) was 22.2 months (34/50; 95% CI 9.4-54.8 months) in arm A, 12.5 months (38/49; 95% CI 7.6-16.4 months) in arm B, and 12.7 months (40/49; 95% CI 7.4-30.5 months) in arm C; 60-month OS rates were 29%, 19%, and 21%, respectively. In an exploratory analysis of OS by response (6-month landmark), the median OS was meaningfully longer for responders versus nonresponders for all arms. No new safety signals were identified with longer follow-up. There were no new discontinuations due to immune-mediated adverse events since the primary analysis. CONCLUSIONS: Consistent with the primary analysis, the arm A regimen of nivolumab plus ipilimumab continued to demonstrate clinically meaningful responses and long-term survival benefit, with no new safety signals in patients with advanced HCC following sorafenib treatment, further supporting its use as a second-line treatment in these patients.",Melero I; Yau T; Kang YK; Kim TY; Santoro A; Sangro B; Kudo M; Hou MM; Matilla A; Tovoli F; Knox J; He AR; El-Rayes B; Acosta-Rivera M; Lim HY; Soleymani S; Yao J; Neely J; Tschaika M; Hsu C; El-Khoueiry AB
29,Stereotactic Body Radiotherapy and Liver Transplant for Liver Cancer: A Nonrandomized Controlled Trial.,10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2024.15998,"IMPORTANCE: Whether stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) as a bridge to liver transplant for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is effective and safe is still unknown. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the feasibility of SBRT before deceased donor liver transplant (DDLT) for previously untreated unresectable HCC. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: In this phase 2 nonrandomized controlled trial conducted between June 1, 2015, and October 18, 2019, 32 eligible patients within UCSF (University of California, San Francisco) criteria underwent dual-tracer (18F-fluorodeoxyglucose and 11C-acetate [ACC]) positron emission tomography with computed tomography (PET-CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with gadoxetate followed by SBRT of 35 to 50 Gy in 5 fractions, and the same imaging afterward while awaiting DDLT. Statistical analysis was performed on an intention-to-treat basis between October 1 and 31, 2023. INTERVENTION: Patients received SBRT followed by DDLT when matched deceased donor grafts were available. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Coprimary end points were progression-free survival (PFS) and objective response rates (ORRs) by the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors, version 1.1 (RECIST 1.1), modified RECIST (mRECIST), and PET Response Criteria in Solid Tumors (PERCIST). Secondary end points were local control rate, overall survival (OS), and safety. RESULTS: A total of 32 patients (median age, 59 years [IQR, 54-63 years]; 22 men [68.8%]) with 56 lesions received SBRT. After a median follow-up of 74.6 months (IQR, 40.1-102.9 months), the median PFS was 17.6 months (95% CI, 6.6-28.6 months), and the median OS was 60.5 months (95% CI, 29.7-91.2 months). The 5-year PFS was 39.9% (95% CI, 19.9%-59.9%), and the 5-year OS was 51.3% (95% CI, 31.7%-70.9%). In terms of number of patients, ORRs were 62.5% ([n = 20] 95% CI, 54.2%-68.7%) by RECIST 1.1, 71.9% ([n = 23] 95% CI, 63.7%-79.0%) by mRECIST, and 78.1% ([n = 25] 95% CI, 73.2%-86.7%) by PERCIST. In terms of number of lesions, ORRs were 75.0% ([n = 42] 95% CI, 61.6%-80.8%) by RECIST 1.1, 83.9% ([n = 47] 95% CI, 74.7%-90.6%) by mRECIST, and 87.5% ([n = 49] 95% CI, 81.3%-98.6%) by PERCIST. Twenty patients with 36 lesions received DDLT, of whom 15 patients (75.0%) with 21 lesions (58.3%) exhibited pathologic complete response. Multivariable analyses revealed that pretreatment metabolic tumor volume (MTV) based on ACC (hazard ratio [HR], 1.06 [95% CI, 1.01-1.10]; P = .01) and complete metabolic response (CMR) by PERCIST (HR, 0.31 [95% CI, 0.10-0.96]; P = .04) were associated with PFS, while pretreatment MTV based on ACC (HR, 1.07 [95% CI, 1.03-1.16]; P = .01), total lesion activity based on ACC (HR, 1.01 [95% CI, 1.00-1.02]; P = .02), and CMR by PERCIST (HR, 0.21 [95% CI, 0.07-0.73]; P = .01) were associated with OS. Toxic effects associated with SBRT were reported for 9 patients (28.1%), with 1 grade 3 event. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: This phase 2 nonrandomized controlled trial demonstrated promising survival and safety outcomes of SBRT before DDLT for unresectable HCC.

30,Dissecting Intra-Tumoral Changes Following Immune Checkpoint Blockades in Intrahepatic Cholangiocarcinoma via Single-Cell Analysis.,10.3389/fimmu.2022.871769,"PURPOSE: To dissect the tumor ecosystem following immune checkpoint blockades (ICBs) in intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC) at a single-cell level. METHODS: Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data of 10 ICC patients for the ICB clinical trial were extracted from GSE125449 and systematically reanalyzed. Bulk RNA-seq data of 255 ICC patients were analyzed. Infiltration levels of SPP1(+)CD68(+) tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) were examined by dual immunofluorescence (IF) staining in 264 resected ICC samples. The correlation between SPP1(+) TAMs and clinicopathological features as well as their prognostic significance was evaluated. RESULTS: Among the 10 patients, five received biopsy at baseline, and others were biopsied at different timings following ICBs. Single-cell transcriptomes for 5,931 cells were obtained. A tighter cellular communication network was observed in ICB-treated ICC. We found a newly emerging VEGF signaling mediated by PGF-VEGFR1 between cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) and endothelial cells in ICC following ICBs. SPP1 expression was dramatically upregulated, and SPP1(+) TAM gene signatures were enriched in TAMs receiving ICB therapy. We also identified SPP1(+) TAMs as an independent adverse prognostic indicator for survival in ICC. CONCLUSION: Our analyses provide an overview of the altered tumor ecosystem in ICC treated with ICBs and highlight the potential role of targeting CAFs and SPP1(+)TAMs in developing a more rational checkpoint blockade-based therapy for ICC.",Sun BY; Zhou C; Guan RY; Liu G; Yang ZF; Wang ZT; Gan W; Zhou J; Fan J; Yi Y; Qiu SJ
31,"Lenvatinib, sintilimab plus transarterial chemoembolization for advanced stage hepatocellular carcinoma: A phase II study.",10.1111/liv.15831,"BACKGROUND & AIMS: Our retrospective study has suggested encouraging outcomes of lenvatinib combined with PD-1 inhibitor and transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) on advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). This phase II trial was conducted to prospectively investigate the efficacy and safety of lenvatinib, sintilimab (a PD-1 inhibitor) plus TACE (Len-Sin-TACE) in patients with advanced stage HCC. METHODS: This was a single-arm phase II trial. Patients with BCLC stage C HCC were recruited. They received lenvatinib (bodyweight ≥60 kg, 12 mg; bodyweight <60 kg, 8 mg) orally once daily, sintilimab (200 mg) intravenously once every 3 weeks, and on demand TACE. The primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS) per mRECIST. RESULTS: Thirty patients were enrolled. The primary endpoint was met with a median PFS of 8.0 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 6.1-9.8) months per mRECIST, which was the same as that per RECIST 1.1. The objective response rate was 60.0% per mRECIST and 30.0% per RECIST 1.1. The disease control rate was 86.7% per mRECIST/RECIST 1.1. The median duration of response was 7.4 (95% CI: 6.6-8.2) months per mRECIST (n = 18) and 4.3 (95% CI: 4.0-4.6) months per RECIST 1.1 (n = 9). The median overall survival was 18.4 (95% CI: 14.5-22.3) months. Treatment-related adverse events (TRAEs) occurred in 28 patients (93.3%) and grade 3 TRAEs were observed in 12 patients (40.0%). There were no grade 4/5 TRAEs. CONCLUSIONS: Len-Sin-TACE showed promising antitumour activities with a manageable safety profile in patients with advanced stage HCC. The preliminary results need to be further evaluated with phase III randomized trials.",Cai M; Huang W; Liang W; Guo Y; Liang L; Lin L; Xie L; Zhou J; Chen Y; Cao B; Wu J; Zhu K
32,Patient-Reported Outcomes From the Phase III HIMALAYA Study of Tremelimumab Plus Durvalumab in Unresectable Hepatocellular Carcinoma.,10.1200/JCO.23.01462,"PURPOSE: In the phase III HIMALAYA study (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT03298451) in unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (uHCC), the Single Tremelimumab Regular Interval Durvalumab (STRIDE) regimen significantly improved overall survival versus sorafenib, and durvalumab monotherapy was noninferior to sorafenib. Patient-reported outcomes (PROs), a secondary outcome from HIMALAYA, are reported here. METHODS: Participants were randomly assigned to receive STRIDE, durvalumab, or sorafenib. PROs were assessed (preplanned secondary outcome) using the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer 30-item Quality of Life Questionnaire and the 18-item HCC module. Time to deterioration (TTD), change from baseline and improvement rate in global health status/quality of life (GHS/QoL), functioning, and disease-related symptoms were analyzed. RESULTS: In total, 1,171 participants were randomly assigned to STRIDE (n = 393), durvalumab (n = 389), or sorafenib (n = 389) and were evaluable for PRO assessments. Across treatment arms, compliance rates for PROs were >77% at baseline and >70% overall. Baseline scores were comparable across treatment arms. TTD in GHS/QoL, physical functioning, fatigue, appetite loss, and abdominal pain was numerically longer for both STRIDE and durvalumab versus sorafenib. Clinically meaningful deterioration in PROs was not observed in any treatment arm. However, TTD in nausea and abdominal swelling was numerically longer for STRIDE versus sorafenib, and the likelihood of clinically meaningful improvement in GHS/QoL, role, emotional and social functioning, and disease-related symptoms was greater with STRIDE and durvalumab versus sorafenib. PROs with STRIDE and durvalumab were generally similar. CONCLUSION: Compared with sorafenib, STRIDE and durvalumab were associated with clinically meaningful, patient-centered GHS/QoL, functioning, and symptom benefits in people with uHCC. These findings support the benefits of the STRIDE regimen compared with sorafenib for a diverse population reflective of the global uHCC population.",Sangro B; Galle PR; Kelley RK; Charoentum C; De Toni EN; Ostapenko Y; Heo J; Cheng AL; Wilson Woods A; Gupta C; Abraham J; McCoy CL; Patel N; Negro A; Vogel A; Abou-Alfa GK
33,Contrast-enhanced US Evaluation of Hepatocellular Carcinoma Response to Chemoembolization: A Prospective Multicenter Trial.,10.1148/radiol.230727,"Background Contrast-enhanced (CE) US has been studied for use in the detection of residual viable hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) after locoregional therapy, but multicenter data are lacking. Purpose To compare two-dimensional (2D) and three-dimensional (3D) CE US diagnostic performance with that of CE MRI or CT, the current clinical standard, in the detection of residual viable HCC after transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) in a prospective multicenter trial. Materials and Methods Participants aged at least 21 years with US-visible HCC scheduled for TACE were consecutively enrolled at one of three participating academic medical centers from May 2016 to March 2022. Each underwent baseline 2D and 3D CE US before TACE, 2D and 3D CE US 1-2 weeks and/or 4-6 weeks after TACE, and CE MRI or CT 4-6 weeks after TACE. CE US and CE MRI or CT were evaluated by three fellowship-trained radiologists for the presence or absence of viable tumors and were compared with reference standards of pathology (18%), angiography on re-treatment after identification of residual disease at 1-2-month follow-up imaging (31%), 4-8-month CE MRI or CT (42%), or short-term (approximately 1-2 months) CE MRI or CT if clinically decompensated and estimated viability was greater than 50% at imaging (9%). Diagnostic performance criteria, including sensitivity and specificity, were obtained for each modality and time point with generalized estimating equation analysis. Results A total of 132 participants were included (mean age, 64 years ± 7 [SD], 87 male). Sensitivity of 2D CE US 4-6 weeks after TACE was 91% (95% CI: 84, 95), which was higher than that of CE MRI or CT (68%; 95% CI: 58, 76; P < .001). Sensitivity of 3D CE US 4-6 weeks after TACE was 89% (95% CI: 81, 94), which was higher than that of CE MRI or CT (P < .001), with no evidence of a difference from 2D CE US (P = .22). CE MRI or CT had 85% (95% CI: 76, 91) specificity, higher than that of 4-6-week 2D and 3D CE US (70% [95% CI: 56, 80] and 67% [95% CI: 53, 78], respectively; P = .046 and P = .023, respectively). No evidence of differences in any diagnostic criteria were observed between 1-2-week and 4-6-week 2D CE US (P > .21).

34,Adjuvant Transarterial Chemoembolization With Sorafenib for Portal Vein Tumor Thrombus: A Randomized Clinical Trial.,10.1001/jamasurg.2024.0506,"IMPORTANCE: Certain patients with hepatocellular carcinoma with portal vein tumor thrombus could benefit from surgical resection, and postoperative adjuvant therapy may lower the incidence of tumor recurrence. OBJECTIVE: To compare the efficacy and safety of sorafenib plus transarterial chemoembolization vs sorafenib alone as postoperative adjuvant therapy for patients with hepatocellular carcinoma with portal vein tumor thrombus. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This was a phase 3, multicenter, randomized clinical trial conducted in 5 hospitals in China. A total of 158 patients were enrolled and randomized from October 2019 to March 2022, with a median follow-up of 28.4 months. Portal vein tumor thrombus was graded by the Cheng classification. Eligible patients with hepatocellular carcinoma with Cheng grade I to III portal vein tumor thrombus (ie, involving segmental or sectoral branches, right- or left-side branch, or main trunk of portal vein) were included. INTERVENTIONS: Patients were randomly assigned 1:1 to receive transarterial chemoembolization with sorafenib or sorafenib alone as postoperative adjuvant therapy. Sorafenib treatment was started within 3 days after randomization, with an initial dose of 400 mg orally twice a day. In the transarterial chemoembolization with sorafenib group, transarterial chemoembolization was performed 1 day after the first administration of sorafenib. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary end point was recurrence-free survival. Efficacy was assessed in the intention-to-treat population and safety was assessed in patients who received at least 1 dose of study treatment. RESULTS: Of 158 patients included, the median (IQR) age was 54 (43-61) years, and 140 (88.6%) patients were male. The median (IQR) recurrence-free survival was significantly longer in the transarterial chemoembolization with sorafenib group (16.8 [12.0-NA] vs 12.6 [7.8-18.1] months; hazard ratio [HR], 0.57; 95% CI, 0.39-0.83; P = .002). The median (IQR) overall survival was also significantly longer with transarterial chemoembolization with sorafenib than with sorafenib alone (30.4 [20.6-NA] vs 22.5 [15.4-NA] months; HR, 0.57; 95% CI, 0.36-0.91; P = .02). The most common grade 3/4 adverse event was hand-foot syndrome (23 of 79 patients in the transarterial chemoembolization with sorafenib group [29.1%] vs 24 of 79 patients in the sorafenib alone group [30.4%]). There were no treatment-related deaths in either group. The transarterial chemoembolization with sorafenib group did not show additional toxicity compared with the sorafenib monotherapy group. CONCLUSION AND RELEVANCE: In this study, the combination of sorafenib and transarterial chemoembolization as postoperative adjuvant therapy in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma with portal vein tumor thrombus resulted in longer recurrence-free survival and overall survival than sorafenib alone and was well tolerated.

35,Proton beam radiotherapy versus transarterial chemoembolization for hepatocellular carcinoma: Results of a randomized clinical trial.,10.1002/cncr.34965,"BACKGROUND: This study compares survival rates, recurrence patterns, toxicity, and treatment cost in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) treated with either transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) or proton beam radiotherapy (PBT). METHODS: Subjects with untreated HCC meeting Milan or San Francisco transplant criteria were recruited. Subjects were randomized to receive PBT (n = 36) or TACE (n = 40). Proton therapy was administered in 15 fractions over 3 weeks to a total dose of 70.2 Gy. TACE was repeated until complete or maximal response. The primary outcome measure was overall survival (OS). Secondary end points were progression-free survival (PFS), local control (LC), toxicity, and cost. RESULTS: Of the 76 randomized patients, 74 were assessed for outcome measures. The 2-year OS for PBT versus TACE was similar at 68%, 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.54-0.86, and 65%, 95% CI, 0.52-0.83 (p = .80), however, median PFS was improved for PBT versus TACE (not reached vs. 12 months, p = .002). LC was improved with PBT versus TACE (hazard ratio, 5.64; 95% CI, 1.78-17.9, p = .003). Days of posttreatment hospitalization were 24 for PBT and 166 for TACE (p < .001). Total mean cost per patient for treatment and posttreatment care revealed a 28% cost savings for PBT. CONCLUSIONS: PBT and TACE yielded similar OS for treatment of HCC, but PFS and LC were improved with PBT compared to TACE. Patients treated with PBT required fewer courses of treatment, fewer posttreatment hospitalization days, and reduced cost of treatment compared to TACE. These data support the use of PBT as a viable treatment alternative to TACE for patients with HCC within transplant criteria.

This trial evaluated the effectiveness and safety of DEB-TACE using small-size (≤ 100 μm) microspheres loaded with epirubicin. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This prospective, single-arm, multicenter study enrolled patients diagnosed with HCC who underwent DEB-TACE using 40 (range, 30-50), 75 (range, 60-90), or 100 (range, 75-125) μm epirubicin-loaded microspheres (TANDEM microspheres, Varian Medical). Bead size was at the discretion of treating physicians and based on tumor size and/or vascular structure. The primary outcome measure was 6-month objective response rate (ORR). Secondary outcome measures were 30-day and 3-month ORR, time to tumor progression and extrahepatic spread, proportion of progression-free survival and overall survival (OS) at one year, and incidence of treatment-associated adverse events. RESULTS: Data from 108 patients from ten centers was analyzed. Six-month ORR was 73.3 and 71.3% based on European association for the study of the liver (EASL) and modified response evaluation criteria in solid tumors (mRECIST) criteria, respectively. Thirty-day ORR was 79.6% for both EASL and mRECIST criteria with 3-month ORR being 80.0 and 81.0%, respectively, for each criteria. One-year PPF and OS rate were 60.3 and 94.3%. There was a total of 30 SAEs reported to be likely to definitely associated with microsphere (n = 9), epirubicin (n = 9), or procedure (n = 12) with none resulting in death. CONCLUSION: DEB-TACE using epirubicin-loaded small-sized (≤ 100 μm) microspheres demonstrates promising local tumor control and acceptable safety in patients with HCC.

37,Safety and Preliminary Efficacy of Pembrolizumab Following Transarterial Chemoembolization for Hepatocellular Carcinoma: The PETAL Phase Ib Study.,10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-24-0177,"PURPOSE: Transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) may prime adaptive immunity and enhance immunotherapy efficacy. PETAL evaluated safety, preliminary activity of TACE plus pembrolizumab and explored mechanisms of efficacy. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients with liver-confined hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) were planned to receive up to two rounds of TACE followed by pembrolizumab 200 mg every 21 days commencing 30 days post-TACE until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity for up to 1 year. Primary endpoint was safety, with assessment window of 21 days from pembrolizumab initiation. Secondary endpoints included progression-free survival (PFS) and evaluation of tumor and host determinants of response. RESULTS: Fifteen patients were included in the safety and efficacy population: 73% had nonviral cirrhosis; median age was 72 years. Child-Pugh class was A in 14 patients. Median tumor size was 4 cm. Ten patients (67%) received pembrolizumab after one TACE; 5 patients after two (33%). Pembrolizumab yielded no synergistic toxicity nor dose-limiting toxicities post-TACE. Treatment-related adverse events occurred in 93% of patients, most commonly skin rash (40%), fatigue, and diarrhea (27%). After a median follow-up of 38.5 months, objective response rate 12 weeks post-TACE was 53%. PFS rate at 12 weeks was 93% and median PFS was 8.95 months [95% confidence interval (CI): 7.30-NE (not estimable)]. Median duration of response was 7.3 months (95% CI: 6.3-8.3). Median overall survival was 33.5 months (95% CI: 11.6-NE). Dynamic changes in peripheral T-cell subsets, circulating tumor DNA, serum metabolites, and in stool bacterial profiles highlight potential mechanisms of action of multimodal therapy.

38,"Phase I/II Multicenter Trial of a Novel Therapeutic Cancer Vaccine, HepaVac-101, for Hepatocellular Carcinoma.",10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-21-4424,"PURPOSE: Immunotherapy for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) shows considerable promise in improving clinical outcomes. HepaVac-101 represents a single-arm, first-in-human phase I/II multicenter cancer vaccine trial for HCC (NCT03203005). It combines multipeptide antigens (IMA970A) with the TLR7/8/RIG I agonist CV8102. IMA970A includes 5 HLA-A*24 and 7 HLA-A*02 as well as 4 HLA-DR restricted peptides selected after mass spectrometric identification in human HCC tissues or cell lines. CV8102 is an RNA-based immunostimulator inducing a balanced Th1/Th2 immune response. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 82 patients with very early- to intermediate-stage HCCs were enrolled and screened for suitable HLA haplotypes and 22 put on study treatment. This consisted in a single infusion of low-dose cyclophosphamide followed by nine intradermal coadministrations of IMA970A and CV8102. Only patients with no disease relapse after standard-of-care treatments were vaccinated. The primary endpoints of the HepaVac-101 clinical trial were safety, tolerability, and antigen-specific T-cell responses. Secondary or exploratory endpoints included additional immunologic parameters and survival endpoints. RESULTS: The vaccination showed a good safety profile. Transient mild-to-moderate injection-site reactions were the most frequent IMA970A/CV8102-related side effects. Immune responses against ≥1 vaccinated HLA class I tumor-associated peptide (TAA) and ≥1 vaccinated HLA class II TAA were respectively induced in 37% and 53% of the vaccinees. CONCLUSIONS: Immunotherapy may provide a great improvement in treatment options for HCC. HepaVac-101 is a first-in-human clinical vaccine trial with multiple novel HLA class I- and class II-restricted TAAs against HCC. The results are initial evidence for the safety and immunogenicity of the vaccine.

39,A multimodal atlas of hepatocellular carcinoma reveals convergent evolutionary paths and 'bad apple' effect on clinical trajectory.,10.1016/j.jhep.2024.05.017,"BACKGROUND & AIMS: Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a highly fatal cancer characterized by high intra-tumor heterogeneity (ITH). A panoramic understanding of its tumor evolution, in relation to its clinical trajectory, may provide novel prognostic and treatment strategies. METHODS: Through the Asia-Pacific Hepatocellular Carcinoma trials group (NCT03267641), we recruited one of the largest prospective cohorts of patients with HCC, with over 600 whole genome and transcriptome samples from 123 treatment-naïve patients. RESULTS: Using a multi-region sampling approach, we revealed seven convergent genetic evolutionary paths governed by the early driver mutations, late copy number variations and viral integrations, which stratify patient clinical trajectories after surgical resection. Furthermore, such evolutionary paths shaped the molecular profiles, leading to distinct transcriptomic subtypes. Most significantly, although we found the coexistence of multiple transcriptomic subtypes within certain tumors, patient prognosis was best predicted by the most aggressive cell fraction of the tumor, rather than by overall degree of transcriptomic ITH level - a phenomenon we termed the 'bad apple' effect. Finally, we found that characteristics throughout early and late tumor evolution provide significant and complementary prognostic power in predicting patient survival. CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, our study generated a comprehensive landscape of evolutionary history for HCC and provides a rich multi-omics resource for understanding tumor heterogeneity and clinical trajectories. IMPACT AND IMPLICATIONS: This prospective study, utilizing comprehensive multi-sector, multi-omics sequencing and clinical data from surgically resected hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), reveals critical insights into the role of tumor evolution and intra-tumor heterogeneity (ITH) in determining the prognosis of HCC. These findings are invaluable for oncology researchers and clinicians, as they underscore the influence of distinct evolutionary paths and the 'bad apple' effect, where the most aggressive tumor fraction dictates disease progression. These insights not only enhance prognostic accuracy post-surgical resection but also pave the way for personalized treatment strategies tailored to specific tumor evolutionary and transcriptomic profiles. The coexistence of multiple subtypes within the same tumor prompts a re-appraisal of the utilities of depending on single samples to represent the entire tumor and suggests the need for clinical molecular imaging. This research thus marks a significant step forward in the clinical understanding and management of HCC, underscoring the importance of integrating tumor evolutionary dynamics and multi-omics biomarkers into therapeutic decision-making.

40,Comparison of Microwave and Radiofrequency Ablation for the Treatment of Small- and Medium-Sized Hepatocellular Carcinomas in a Prospective Randomized Trial.,10.1055/a-2203-2733,"PURPOSE: To compare the therapeutic response and clinical outcome of CT-guided percutaneous microwave (MWA) and radiofrequency ablation (RFA) for the treatment of small- and medium-sized HCC. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this prospective trial, 50 patients with HCC were randomly assigned to MWA or RFA treatment. MRI was performed 24 h before and after ablation and subsequently in 3-month intervals. Ablation volumes, ablation durations, adverse events (AE), technique efficacy, technical success, local tumor progression (LTP), disease-free survival (DFS), intrahepatic distant recurrence (IDR), and overall survival (OS) rates were evaluated. RESULTS: The mean ablation volume was 66.5 cm³ for MWA and 29.2  cm³ for RFA (p < 0.01). The mean ablation durations for MWA and RFA were 11.2 ± 4.0 min and 16.3 ± 4.7 min, respectively (p < 0.01). Six mild AEs were documented (p > 0.05). All treatments had a technical success rate and a technique efficacy rate of 100 % (50/50, p = 1.00). LTP within 2 years occurred in 1/25 (4 %) in the MWA group and in 4/25 (16 %) in the RFA group (p = 0.06). IDR within 2 years was 8/25 (32 %) for MWA and 14/25 (56 %) for RFA (p < 0.05). The median DFS was 24.5 months and 13.4 months for MWA and RFA, respectively (p = 0.02). The 1-, 2-, 3-year OS rates were 100 %, 80 %, 72 % in the MWA group and 72 %, 64 %, 60 % in the RFA group, respectively (p ≥ 0.14). CONCLUSION: The clinical outcome after MWA or RFA for HCC treatment was very similar with no significant differences in LTP or OS. However, MWA shows a trend toward better DFS with fewer IDRs than RFA. KEY POINTS: · MWA allows for larger ablation volumes and a shorter treatment duration compared to RFA in patients with HCC.. · MWA shows a trend toward better disease-free survival and fewer intrahepatic distant recurrences compared to RFA.. · The three-year survival rates show no significant difference between the two methods..",Vogl TJ; Martin SS; Gruber-Rouh T; Booz C; Koch V; Nour-Eldin NA; Hussainy Said MN
41,The phosphatidylserine targeting antibody bavituximab plus pembrolizumab in unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma: a phase 2 trial.,10.1038/s41467-024-46542-y,"Immune checkpoint inhibitors targeting PD-1/L1 have modest efficacy in hepatocellular carcinoma as single agents. Targeting membranous phosphatidylserine may induce pro-inflammatory and -immune stimulating effects that enhance immunotherapy activity. This hypothesis was tested in a single-arm phase 2 trial evaluating frontline bavituximab, a phosphatidylserine targeting antibody, plus pembrolizumab (anti-PD-1) in patients with unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (NCT03519997). The primary endpoint was investigator-assessed objective response rate among evaluable patients, and secondary end points included progression-free survival, incidence of adverse events, overall survival, and duration of response. Among 28 evaluable patients, the confirmed response rate was 32.1%, which met the pre-specified endpoint, and the median progression-free survival was 6.3 months (95% CI, 1.3-11.3 months). Treatment related-adverse events of any grade occurred in 45.7% of patients, with grade 3 or greater adverse events in 14.3% of patients. Adverse events of any cause were observed in 33 patients (94.3%), with grade 3 or greater adverse events in 11 patients (31.4%). Prespecified exploratory analyses of baseline tumor specimens showed that a depletion of B cells, and the presence of fibrotic tissue and expression of immune checkpoints in stroma was associated with tumor response. These results suggest that targeting phosphatidylserine may lead to synergistic effects with PD-1 blockade without increasing toxicity rates, and future studies on this therapeutic strategy may be guided by biomarkers characterizing the pre-treatment tumor microenvironment.",Hsiehchen D; Beg MS; Kainthla R; Lohrey J; Kazmi SM; Khosama L; Maxwell MC; Kline H; Katz C; Hassan A; Kubota N; Siglinsky E; Pillai AK; Youssoufian H; Mockbee C; Culm K; Uhlik M; Benjamin L; Brekken RA; Ahn C; Singal AG; Zhu H; Hoshida Y; Yopp AC

The aim of this study was to report the results of acquired experience in a tertiary center for all unresectable HCCs. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective, observational study using data collected from consecutive patients undergoing SIRT between October 2013 and June 2020. DS was considered achieved when a curative treatment could be proposed 6 months after SIRT. RESULTS: One hundred twenty-seven patients were included (male = 90%, 64 ± 11 y), of whom 112 (n = 88%) had cirrhosis. HCC was classified as BCLC stage C in 64 patients (50%), with a median diameter of 61 mm, an infiltrative pattern in 51 patients (40%), and portal vein invasion in 62 (49%) patients. Fifty patients (39%) achieved DS 6 months following SIRT, with 29 of them (23%) undergoing curative treatment in a median time of 4.3 months: 17 (13%) were transplanted, 11 (85%) had liver resection, and 1 patient had a radiofrequency ablation. The median overall survival of patients with or without DS was 51 versus 10 months, respectively (p < 0.001). In patients who achieved DS, progression-free survival was higher in patients who underwent surgery: 47 versus 11 months (p < 0.001). Four variables were independently associated with DS: age (OR: 0.96, 95% CI: [0.92, 0.99]; p = 0.032), baseline α-fetoprotein (OR: 1.00, 95% CI: [1.00, 1.00]; p = 0.034), HCC distribution (OR: 0.3, 95% CI: [0.11, 0.75]; p = 0.012), and ALBI grade (OR: 0.34. 95% CI: [0.14, 0.80]; p = 0.014). CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that SIRT in patients with unresectable HCC could be an effective treatment: DS was achieved for around 39% of the patients and more than half of these then underwent curative treatment. behalf of the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases.",Regnault H; Chalaye J; Galetto-Pregliasco A; Perrin C; Derbel H; Amaddeo G; Mulé S; Lequoy M; Kobeiter H; Reizine E; Itti E; Duvoux C; Laurent A; Leroy V; Sommacale D; Rasolonirina D; Luciani A; Calderaro J; Tacher V; Brustia R

METHODS AND MATERIALS: Patients were included if they were eligible for TACE. They could also be recruited if they required treatment prior to liver transplantation. A maximum of four TACE-DEB procedures and ablation after incomplete TACE-DEB were both allowed. SBRT was delivered in six fractions of 8-9Gy. Primary end point was time to progression (TTP). Secondary endpoints were local control (LC), overall survival (OS), response rate (RR), toxicity, and quality of life (QoL). The calculated sample size was 100 patients. RESULTS: Between May 2015 and April 2020, 30 patients were randomized to the study. Due to slow accrual the trial was closed prematurely. Two patients in the SBRT arm were considered ineligible leaving 16 patients in the TACE-DEB arm and 12 in the SBRT arm. Median follow-up was 28.1 months. Median TTP was 12 months for TACEDEB and 19 months for SBRT (p=0.15). Median LC was 12 months for TACE-DEB and >40 months (not reached) for SBRT (p=0.075). Median OS was 36.8 months for TACEDEB and 44.1 months for SBRT (p=0.36). A post-hoc analysis showed 100% for SBRT 1- and 2-year LC, and 54.4% and 43.6% for TACE-DEB (p=0.019). Both treatments resulted in RR>80%. Three episodes of possibly related toxicity grade ≥3 were observed after TACE-DEB. No episodes were observed after SBRT. QoL remained stable after both treatment arms. CONCLUSIONS: In this trial, TTP after TACE-DEB was not significantly improved by SBRT, while SBRT showed higher local antitumoral activity than TACE-DEB, without detrimental effects on OS, toxicity and QoL.

This study aimed to investigate the efficacy and safety of TACE combined with envafolimab and lenvatinib for uHCC. Eligible patients with uHCC received envafolimab and lenvatinib after TACE until disease progression, conversion to surgery, intolerable toxicities, or death. The primary endpoint was the objective response rate (ORR) assessed according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1 criteria. Between March 2022 and July 2022, 38 patients were included for safety analysis, and 36 patients were included for efficacy analysis. As of the data cutoff (13 December 2023), the median follow-up was 16.9 months. The ORR was 50%, and disease control rate (DCR) was 83.3% per RECIST 1.1 (ORR and DCR of both 83.3% per modified RECIST (mRECIST)). The median progression-free survival (PFS) was 7.58 months.

45,Adjuvant immunotherapy improves recurrence-free and overall survival following surgical resection for intermediate/advanced hepatocellular carcinoma a multicenter propensity matching analysis.,10.3389/fimmu.2023.1322233,"BACKGROUND & AIMS: The effectiveness of adjuvant immunotherapy to diminish recurrence and improve long-term prognosis following curative-intent surgical resection for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is of increased interest, especially among individuals at high risk of recurrence. The objective of the current study was to investigate the impact of adjuvant immunotherapy on long-term recurrence and survival after curative resection among patients with intermediate/advanced HCC. METHODS: Using a prospectively-collected multicenter database, patients who underwent curative-intent resection for Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC) stage B/C HCC were identified. Propensity score matching (PSM) analysis was used to compare recurrence-free survival (RFS) and overall survival (OS) between patients treated with and without adjuvant immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs). Multivariate Cox-regression analysis further identified independent factors of RFS and OS. RESULTS: Among the 627 enrolled patients, 109 patients (23.3%) received adjuvant immunotherapy. Most ICI-related adverse reactions were grading I-II. PSM analysis created 99 matched pairs of patients with comparable baseline characteristics between patients treated with and without adjuvant immunotherapy. In the PSM cohort, the median RFS (29.6 vs. 19.3 months, P=0.031) and OS (35.1 vs. 27.8 months, P=0.036) were better among patients who received adjuvant immunotherapy versus patients who did not. After adjustment for other confounding factors on multivariable analyzes, adjuvant immunotherapy remained independently associated with favorable RFS (HR: 0.630; 95% CI: 0.435-0.914; P=0.015) and OS (HR: 0.601; 95% CI: 0.401-0.898; P=0.013). Subgroup analyzes identified potentially prognostic benefits of adjuvant immunotherapy among patients with intermediate-stage and advanced-stage HCC. CONCLUSION: This real-world observational study demonstrated that adjuvant immunotherapy was associated with improved RFS and OS following curative-intent resection of intermediate/advanced HCC. Future randomized controlled trials are warranted to establish definitive evidence for this specific population at high risks of recurrence.

46,"Nivolumab after selective internal radiation therapy for the treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma: a phase 2, single-arm study.",10.1136/jitc-2022-005457,"PURPOSE: To evaluate the safety and efficacy of selective internal radiation therapy (SIRT) in combination with a PD-1 inhibitor in patients with unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (uHCC) and liver-only disease ineligible for chemoembolization. PATIENTS AND METHODS: NASIR-HCC is a single-arm, multicenter, open-label, phase 2 trial that recruited from 2017 to 2019 patients who were naïve to immunotherapy and had tumors in the BCLC B2 substage (single or multiple tumors beyond the up-to-7 rule), or unilobar tumors with segmental or lobar portal vein invasion (PVI); no extrahepatic spread; and preserved liver function. Patients received SIRT followed 3 weeks later by nivolumab (240 mg every 2 weeks) for up to 24 doses or until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Safety was the primary endpoint. Secondary objectives included objective response rate (ORR), time to progression (TTP), and overall survival (OS). RESULTS: 42 patients received SIRT (31 BCLC-B2, 11 with PVI) and were followed for a median of 22.2 months. 27 patients discontinued and 1 never received Nivolumab. 41 patients had any-grade adverse events (AE) and 21 had serious AEs (SAE). Treatment-related AEs and SAEs grade 3-4 occurred in 8 and 5 patients, respectively. Using RECIST 1.1 criteria, ORR reported by investigators was 41.5% (95% CI 26.3% to 57.9%). Four patients were downstaged to partial hepatectomy. Median TTP was 8.8 months (95% CI 7.0 to 10.5) and median OS was 20.9 months (95% CI 17.7 to 24.1). CONCLUSIONS: The combination of SIRT and nivolumab has shown an acceptable safety profile and signs of antitumor activity in the treatment of patients with uHCC that were fit for SIRT.

47,A randomised controlled trial of Standard Of Care versus RadioAblaTion in Early Stage HepatoCellular Carcinoma (SOCRATES HCC).,10.1186/s12885-024-12504-2,"BACKGROUND: Therapeutic options for early-stage hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in individual patients can be limited by tumor and location, liver dysfunction and comorbidities. Many patients with early-stage HCC do not receive curative-intent therapies. Stereotactic ablative body radiotherapy (SABR) has emerged as an effective, non-invasive HCC treatment option, however, randomized evidence for SABR in the first line setting is lacking. METHODS: Trans-Tasman Radiation Oncology Group (TROG) 21.07 SOCRATES-HCC is a phase II, prospective, randomised trial comparing SABR to other current standard of care therapies for patients with a solitary HCC ≤ 8 cm, ineligible for surgical resection or transplantation. The study is divided into 2 cohorts. Cohort 1 will compromise 118 patients with tumors ≤ 3 cm eligible for thermal ablation randomly assigned (1:1 ratio) to thermal ablation or SABR. Cohort 2 will comprise 100 patients with tumors > 3 cm up to 8 cm in size, or tumors ≤ 3 cm ineligible for thermal ablation, randomly assigned (1:1 ratio) to SABR or best other standard of care therapy including transarterial therapies. The primary objective is to determine whether SABR results in superior freedom from local progression (FFLP) at 2 years compared to thermal ablation in cohort 1 and compared to best standard of care therapy in cohort 2. Secondary endpoints include progression free survival, overall survival, adverse events, patient reported outcomes and health economic analyses. DISCUSSION: The SOCRATES-HCC study will provide the first randomized, multicentre evaluation of the efficacy, safety and cost effectiveness of SABR versus other standard of care therapies in the first line treatment of unresectable, early-stage HCC. It is a broad, multicentre collaboration between hepatology, interventional radiology and radiation oncology groups around Australia, coordinated by TROG Cancer Research.

48,The utility of P-I-R classification in predicting the on-treatment histological and clinical outcomes of patients with hepatitis B and advanced liver fibrosis.,10.1097/HEP.0000000000000563,"BACKGROUND AND AIMS: The predominantly progressive, indeterminate, and predominantly regressive (P-I-R) classification extends beyond staging and provides information on dynamic changes of liver fibrosis. However, the prognostic implication of P-I-R classification is not elucidated. Therefore, in the present research, we investigated the utility of P-I-R classification in predicting the on-treatment clinical outcomes. APPROACH AND RESULTS: In an extension study on a randomized controlled trial, we originally enrolled 1000 patients with chronic hepatitis B and biopsy-proven histological significant fibrosis, and treated them for more than 7 years with entecavir-based therapy. Among the 727 patients with a second biopsy at treatment week 72, we compared P-I-R classification and Ishak score changes in 646 patients with adequate liver sections for the histological evaluation. Progressive, indeterminate, and regressive cases were observed in 70%, 17%, and 13% of patients before treatments and 20%, 14%, and 64% after 72-week treatment, respectively, which could further differentiate the histological outcomes of patients with stable Ishak scores. The 7-year cumulative incidence of HCC was 1.5% for the regressive cases, 4.3% for the indeterminate cases, and 22.8% for the progressive cases ( p <0.001). After adjusting for age, treatment regimen, platelet counts, cirrhosis, Ishak fibrosis score changes, and Laennec staging, the posttreatment progressive had a HR of 17.77 (vs. posttreatment regressive; 95% CI: 5.55-56.88) for the incidence of liver-related events (decompensation, HCC, and death/liver transplantation). CONCLUSIONS: The P-I-R classification can be a meaningful complement to the Ishak fibrosis score not only in evaluating the histological changes but also in predicting the clinical outcomes.",Chang X; Lv C; Wang B; Wang J; Song Z; An L; Chen S; Chen Y; Shang Q; Yu Z; Tan L; Li Q; Liu H; Jiang L; Xiao G; Chen L; Lu W; Hu X; Dong Z; Chen Y; Sun Y; Wang X; Li Z; Chen D; You H; Jia J; Yang Y

We aimed to assess the efficacy of irradiation stent placement with 125 I plus transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (TACE) (ISP-TACE) compared to sorafenib plus TACE (Sora-TACE) in these patients. METHODS: In this multicenter randomized controlled trial, participants with HCC and Vp4 PVTT without extrahepatic metastases were enrolled from November 2018 to July 2021 at 16 medical centers. The primary endpoint was overall survival (OS). The secondary endpoints were hepatic function, time to symptomatic progression, patency of portal vein, disease control rate, and treatment safety. RESULTS: Of 105 randomized participants, 51 were assigned to the ISP-TACE group, and 54 were assigned to the Sora-TACE group. The median OS was 9.9 months versus 6.3 months (95% CI: 0.27-0.82; P =0.01). Incidence of acute hepatic decompensation was 16% (8 of 51) versus 33% (18 of 54) ( P =0.036). The time to symptomatic progression was 6.6 months versus 4.2 months (95% CI: 0.38-0.93; P =0.037). The median stent patency was 7.2 months (interquartile range, 4.7-9.3) in the ISP-TACE group. The disease control rate was 86% (44 of 51) versus 67% (36 of 54) ( P =0.018). Incidences of adverse events at least grade 3 were comparable between the safety populations of the two groups: 16 of 49 (33%) versus 18 of 50 (36%) ( P =0.73).

AIM: To evaluate the efficacy of combining SBRT with sintilimab for patients with recurrent or oligometastatic HCC. METHODS: This trial involved patients with recurrent or oligometastatic HCC intravenously treated with SBRT plus sintilimab every 3 wk for 12 mo or until disease progression. The primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS). RESULTS: Twenty-five patients were enrolled from August 14, 2019, to August 23, 2021. The median treatment duration was 10.2 (range, 0.7-14.6) months. SBRT was delivered at a median dose of 54 (range, 48-60) Gy in 6 (range, 6-10) fractions. The median follow-up time was 21.9 (range, 10.3-39.7) mo, and 32 targeted lesions among 25 patients were evaluated for treatment response according to the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors version 1.1. The median PFS was 19.7 mo [95% confidence interval (CI): 16.9-NA], with PFS rates of 68% (95%CI: 52-89) and 45.3% (95%CI: 28-73.4) at 12 and 24 mo, respectively. The median overall survival (OS) was not reached, with OS rates of 91.5% (95%CI: 80.8-100.0) and 83.2% (95%CI: 66.5-100.0) at 12 and 24 mo, respectively. The 1- and 2-year local control rate were 100% and 90.9% (95%CI: 75.4%-100.0%), respectively. The confirmed objective response rate and disease control rate was 96%, and 96%, respectively. Most adverse events were graded as 1 or 2, and grade 3 adverse events were observed in three patients.

51,Serum MYCN as a predictive biomarker of prognosis and therapeutic response in the prevention of hepatocellular carcinoma recurrence.,10.1002/ijc.34893,"The proto-oncogene MYCN expression marked a cancer stem-like cell population in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and served as a therapeutic target of acyclic retinoid (ACR), an orally administered vitamin A derivative that has demonstrated promising efficacy and safety in reducing HCC recurrence. This study investigated the role of MYCN as a predictive biomarker for therapeutic response to ACR and prognosis of HCC. MYCN gene expression in HCC was analyzed in the Cancer Genome Atlas and a Taiwanese cohort (N = 118). Serum MYCN protein levels were assessed in healthy controls (N = 15), patients with HCC (N = 116), pre- and post-surgical patients with HCC (N = 20), and a subset of patients from a phase 3 clinical trial of ACR (N = 68, NCT01640808). The results showed increased MYCN gene expression in HCC tumors, which positively correlated with HCC recurrence in non-cirrhotic or single-tumor patients. Serum MYCN protein levels were higher in patients with HCC, decreased after surgical resection of HCC, and were associated with liver functional reserve and fibrosis markers, as well as long-term HCC prognosis (>4 years). Subgroup analysis of a phase 3 clinical trial of ACR identified serum MYCN as the risk factor most strongly associated with HCC recurrence. Patients with HCC with higher serum MYCN levels after a 4-week treatment of ACR exhibited a significantly higher risk of recurrence (hazard ratio 3.27; p = .022). In conclusion, serum MYCN holds promise for biomarker-based precision medicine for the prevention of HCC, long-term prognosis of early-stage HCC, and identification of high-response subgroups for ACR-based treatment.

SAFFRON-104 (NCT03941873) was a multicohort phase Ib/II study investigating sitravatinib with/without tislelizumab, an anti-programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) antibody, in patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) or gastric cancer/gastroesophageal junction cancer (GC/GEJC). METHODS: Eligible patients had histologically/cytologically confirmed advanced HCC or GC/GEJC. Phase I determined the recommended phase II dose (RP2D) of sitravatinib with/without tislelizumab. Phase II evaluated sitravatinib monotherapy in patients with pretreated HCC, and sitravatinib plus tislelizumab in anti-PD-(L)1-naïve or -treated HCC and anti-PD-(L)1-naïve GC/GEJC. Primary endpoints were safety/tolerability (phase I) and objective response rate (ORR) (phase II). RESULTS: At data cutoff (March 31, 2023), 111 patients were enrolled; 102 were efficacy-evaluable (median study follow-up 9.1 months [range: 0.7-36.9]). The RP2D of sitravatinib was determined as 120 mg orally once daily. In patients receiving sitravatinib monotherapy and sitravatinib in combination with tislelizumab, grade ≥ 3 treatment-related adverse events occurred in 14 (51.9%) and 42 (50.0%) patients, respectively. The ORR was 25% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 8.7-49.1) in patients with pretreated HCC receiving sitravatinib monotherapy. In patients receiving sitravatinib with tislelizumab, the ORR was 11.5% (95% CI 2.4-30.2) with anti-PD-(L)1-naïve HCC, 9.5% (95% CI 1.2-30.4) with anti-PD-(L)1-treated HCC, and 16.1% (95% CI 5.5-33.7) in patients with anti-PD-(L)1-naïve GC/GEJC.

53,Efficacy and outcome of molecular targeted therapies in elderly patients with hepatocellular carcinoma: Relative dose intensity associated with overall survival.,10.1002/cam4.6783,"AIM: Indications of drug therapies to elderly patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) should be carefully determined. The current study assessed the safety and efficacy of molecular targeted agents (MTAs) in the elderly patients with HCC, and identified factors associated with prognosis in a real-world clinical setting. METHODS: In a retrospective observational study, clinical data of patients with unresectable HCC treated with sorafenib or lenvatinib as first-line treatment at our hospital between 2011 and 2022, were investigated. Clinical parameters, therapeutic effects, adverse events (AEs), and prognosis were evaluated separately for the non-elderly (<75 years old) and elderly patients (≥75 years old). RESULTS: Overall, 111 patients were enrolled, including 59 non-elderly and 52 elderly patients. Compared to the non-elderly patients, the elderly patients had significantly lower skeletal muscle mass and a significantly lower percentage of patients in poor general condition with performance status 2 or higher, but there were no differences in parameters related to liver function or nutritional status. There were no significant differences in the incidence of severe AEs and therapeutic effects between the groups. No significant difference in progression-free survival was observed in the elderly and non-elderly patients; however, overall survival (OS) for sorafenib treatment was shorter in the elderly patients than in the non-elderly patients. Elderly patients consumed lower doses of both the drugs, and relative dose intensity (RDI) 4 weeks after treatment (4W-RDI) was associated with OS. Further, OS in the elderly patients was significantly longer in the subgroup with high 4W-RDI as compared to that in the subgroup with low 4W-RDI. CONCLUSIONS: MTAs can be safely administered to elderly patients with HCC. Furthermore, 4W-RDI is associated with longer OS. Maintaining RDI in the early phase is crucial in predicting the success of treatment with MTAs, especially in the elderly patients.",Oura K; Morishita A; Takuma K; Nakahara M; Tadokoro T; Fujita K; Mimura S; Tani J; Ono M; Himoto T; Masaki T

This study evaluated the efficacy and safety of tislelizumab plus lenvatinib in systemic treatment-naïve patients with uHCC. METHODS: In this multicenter, single-arm, phase 2 study, systemic treatment-naïve patients with uHCC received tislelizumab 200 mg every three weeks plus lenvatinib (bodyweight ≥ 60 kg: 12 mg; < 60 kg: 8 mg; once daily). Dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) were evaluated in safety run-in phase to determine whether to enter the expansion phase. The primary endpoint was objective response rate (ORR) assessed by independent review committee (IRC) per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors, version 1.1 (RECIST v1.1). Based on Simon's two-stage design, > 6 responders were needed in stage 1 (n = 30) to continue the study, and ≥ 18 responders were needed by the end of stage 2 (n = 60) to demonstrate statistical superiority to a historical control of lenvatinib monotherapy. RESULTS: Sixty-four patients were enrolled. No DLTs were reported. The study achieved statistical superiority (p = 0.0003) with 23 responders assessed by IRC per RECIST v1.1 in the first 60 patients of the efficacy evaluable analysis set (n = 62).

55,Conversion surgery for initially unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma using lenvatinib combined with TACE plus PD-1 inhibitor: A real-world observational study.,10.1016/j.dld.2023.11.027,"BACKGROUND: Conversion therapy for initially unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (iuHCC) using lenvatinib combined with transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (TACE) plus a PD-1 inhibitor (LTP) has achieved promising results. However, further comparative research is necessary to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of conversion surgery (CS) for iuHCC. METHODS: Data for 32 consecutive patients with iuHCC receiving CS and 419 consecutive patients with resectable HCC receiving initial surgery (IS) between November 2019 and September 2022 were collected retrospectively. After propensity score matching (PSM), 65 patients were selected. RESULTS: Before matching, the CS group had longer EFS (not reached vs. 12.9 months, P < 0.001) and similar OS (not reached vs. not reached, P = 0.510) compared with the IS group. Similar results for EFS (P = 0.001) and OS (P = 0.190) were obtained after matching. The multivariable Cox model (HR = 0.231, 95% CI: 0.105-0.504; P < 0.001) and subgroup analyses confirmed that CS could improve EFS. The CS group had significantly lower incidence of microvascular invasion (MVI) than the IS group (3.1% vs. 50.4%, P < 0.001). Moreover, the two groups had similar safety profiles. CONCLUSIONS: CS is effective and safe for patients with iuHCC receiving LTP. LTP has the potential to reduce risk factors for postoperative recurrence, especially MVI, which may influence surgical decision-making. Elsevier Ltd.

This phase 2 trial (ChiCTR2000036385) aimed to investigate the activity and safety of perioperative tislelizumab plus intensity modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) for resectable HCC with MVI. Thirty treatment-naïve patients with MVI received 3 cycles of tislelizumab intravenously (200 mg, every three weeks) and concurrent IMRT (45 Gray in 15 fractions). Primary endpoints were the overall response rate (ORR) and overall survival (OS). Secondary endpoints were the proportion of patients with a complete or major pathological response (pCR or MPR), recurrence-free survival (RFS) and safety. Of patients enrolled, 15 (50%) underwent curative surgery followed by adjuvant tislelizumab. The ORR was 30.0% (90% CI 16.6%-46.5%) and the median OS was 18.7 months. Of the 15 patients underwent surgical resection, 10 (66.7%) achieved pCR or MPR and 8 (53.3%) remained recurrence-free. The median RFS were not reached with a median follow-up of 21.77 months (95% CI 12.50-31.03) post-surgery. 4 (13.3%) patients experienced grade 3 treatment-related adverse events.

57,"Neoadjuvant therapy of sequential TACE, camrelizumab, and apatinib for single huge hepatocellular carcinoma (NEO-START): study protocol for a randomized controlled trial.",10.1186/s13063-024-08340-1,"BACKGROUND: The high recurrence rate after liver resection emphasizes the urgent need for neoadjuvant therapy in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) to enhance the overall prognosis for patients. Immune checkpoint inhibitors, camrelizumab combined with an anti-angiogenic tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) apatinib, have emerged as a first-line treatment option for patients with unresectable HCC, yet its neoadjuvant application in combination with transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) in HCC remains unexplored. Therefore, this study aims to investigate the efficacy and safety of sequential TACE, camrelizumab, and apatinib as a neoadjuvant therapy for single, huge HCC. METHODS: This multi-center, open-label randomized phase 3 trial will be conducted at 7 tertiary hospitals. Patients with single huge (≥ 10 cm in diameter), resectable HCC will be randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to arm of surgery alone or arm of neoadjuvant therapy followed by surgery. In the neoadjuvant therapy group, patients will receive TACE within 1 week after randomization, followed by camrelizumab (200 mg q2w, 4 cycles), along with apatinib (250 mg qd, 2 months). Patients will receive liver resection after neoadjuvant therapy unless the disease is assessed as progressive. The primary outcome is recurrence-free survival (RFS) at 1 year. The planned sample size of 60 patients will be calculated to permit the accumulation of sufficient RFS events in 1 year to achieve 80% power for the RFS primary endpoint. DISCUSSION: Synergistic effects provided by multimodality therapy of locoregional treatment, TKI, and anti-programmed cell death 1 inhibitor significantly improved overall survival for patients with unresectable HCC.

METHODS: This single-center prospective randomized study was conducted in the Cancer Hospital, Guang Xi Medical University, Nanning. A total of 72 patients who received treatment in this hospital between August 2017 and July 2019 were included and randomly allocated to TACE group (n = 48) and RT group (n = 24). Next, overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) rates, recurrence patterns, financial burden, and safety were evaluated. RESULTS: The difference between the RT and TACE groups was not significant in one-, three-, and five-year OS (87.5%, 79.0%, and 62.5% vs. 93.8%, 75.9%, and 63.4%, respectively, P = 0.071) and PFS rates (79.0%, 54.2%, and 22.6% vs. 75.0%, 47.9%, and 32.6%, respectively, P = 0.071). Compared to the TACE group, the RT group had significantly lower intrahepatic recurrence rate (20.8% vs. 52.1%, P = 0.011), higher extrahepatic recurrence rate (37.5% vs. 14.6%, P = 0.034), and no marginal and diffuse recurrences (0% vs. 16.7%, P < 0.05). The mean overall treatment cost was higher (¥62,550.59 ± 4397.27 vs. ¥40,732.56 ± 9210.54, P < 0.01), the hospital stay (15.1 ± 3.7 vs. 11.8 ± 4.1 days, P < 0.01) was longer, and the overall treatment stay (13.3 ± 5.3 vs. 41.29 ± 12.4 days, P < 0.01) was shorter in the TACE group than in the RT group. Besides, both groups did not exhibit significant differences in the frequency and severity of adverse events. CONCLUSION: Both adjuvant TACE and RT can better the OS and PFS of patients with HCC. However, RT has a significantly better performance than TACE in terms of improving intrahepatic recurrence rate, treatment cost and hospital stay. part of Springer Nature.",Bai T; Tang ZH; Wang XB; Chen J; Ye JZ; Lu SL; Wei M; Wu FX; Li LQ
59,Microwave versus radiofrequency ablation for the treatment of liver malignancies: a randomized controlled phase 2 trial.,10.1038/s41598-021-03802-x,"Microwave (MWA) and radiofrequency ablation (RFA) are main ablative techniques for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and colorectal liver metastasis (MT). This randomized phase 2 clinical trial compares the effectiveness of MWA and RFA as well as morphology of corresponding ablation zones. HCC and MT patients with 1.5-4 cm tumors, suitable for ablation, were randomized into MWA or RFA Groups. The primary endpoint was short-to-long diameter ratio of ablation zone (SLR). Primary technical success (TS) and a cumulative local tumor progression (LTP) after a median 2-year follow-up were compared. Between June 2015 and April 2020, 82 patients were randomly assigned (41 patients per group). For the per-protocol analysis, five patients were excluded. MWA created larger ablation zones than RFA (p = 0.036) although without differences in SLR (0.5 for both groups, p = 0.229). The TS was achieved in 98% (46/47) and 90% (45/50) (p = 0.108), and LTP was observed in 21% (10/47) vs. 12% (6/50) (OR 1.9 [95% CI 0.66-5.3], p = 0.238) of tumors in MWA vs. RFA Group, respectively.

60,Radiofrequency ablation combined with toripalimab for recurrent hepatocellular carcinoma: A prospective controlled trial.,10.1002/cam4.6602,"OBJECTIVE: The effectiveness and security of radiofrequency ablation (RFA) in combination with toripalimab (anti-PD-1) for the treatment of recurrent hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) was studied in this article. METHODS: Total of 40 patients were enrolled in the study between September 2019 and November 2021. Data follow-up ends in April 2022. The study's main focus is on recurrence free survival (RFS), while the secondary objectives was safety. Chi-square tests, Kaplan-Meier, and Cox proportional hazards models were utilized to analyze the data. RESULTS: The median follow-up period was 21.40 months, and the median RFS was 15.40 months in the group that received combination therapy, which was statistically significantly different (HR: 0.44, p = 0.04) compared with the RFA group (8.2 months). RFS rates (RFSr) at 6, 12 and 18 months in the combination therapy groups and RFA groups were 80% vs 65%, 62.7% vs 35% and 48.7% vs 18.8%, respectively. Between the two groups, significant difference of RFSr was found at 18 months (p = 0.04). No statistical differences were observed between the two groups in terms of safeness (p > 0.05). The subgroup analysis indicated that the combination of RFA and anti-PD-1 led to better RFS than RFA alone. Moreover, patients benefited more from combination therapy in the groups younger than 60 years (HR: 0.26, p = 0.018), male (HR: 0.32, p = 0.028) and Child-Pugh grade A (HR: 0.38, p = 0.032). CONCLUSIONS: Combining RFA with anti-PD-1 showed improved RFS and was deemed safe for patients with recurrent HCC who had previously undergone RFA treatment alone.",Wen Z; Wang J; Tu B; Liu Y; Yang Y; Hou L; Yang X; Liu X; Xie H
61,Preoperative sintilimab plus transarterial chemoembolization for hepatocellular carcinoma exceeding the Milan criteria: A phase II trial.,10.1097/HC9.0000000000000054,"BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Many patients with HCC of Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC) stage A exceeding the Milan criteria, or of BCLC stage B, can undergo resection after successful preoperative therapy, but an optimal approach has not been identified. We investigated preoperative drug-eluting bead transarterial chemoembolization (DEB-TACE) plus sintilimab, in this setting. APPROACH AND RESULTS: In this prospective, phase II study (NCT04174781), adults with HCC of BCLC stage A exceeding the Milan criteria, or BCLC stage B, and ineligible for surgical resection, received sintilimab 200 mg and DEB-TACE. The primary endpoint was progression-free survival by modified RECIST. Secondary endpoints included objective response rate, pathologic response rate, and safety. At the data cutoff (July 2022), among 60 patients, the objective response rate was 62% (37/60) and 51 patients had undergone surgery. After a median follow-up of 26.0 months (range, 3.4-31.8), the median progression-free survival was 30.5 months (95% CI: 16.1-not reached). Among patients undergoing surgery, median progression-free survival was not reached and the 12-month progression-free survival rate was 76% (95% CI: 67-91). A pathologic complete response was achieved in 14% (7/51) of these patients. All patients experienced at least one adverse event, but these were generally manageable. Exploratory analyses showed an association between cytokeratin, V-domain Ig-containing Suppressor of T-cell Activation, CD68, CD169, and cluster 13 fibroblasts and recurrence after surgery. CONCLUSIONS: Sintilimab plus DEB-TACE before surgery showed good efficacy and safety in patients with HCC of BCLC stage A exceeding the Milan criteria or BCLC stage B. behalf of the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases.",Guo C; Zhang J; Huang X; Chen Y; Sheng J; Huang X; Sun J; Xiao W; Sun K; Gao S; Que R; Shen Y; Zhang M; Wu J; Bai X; Liang T

The liver function indexes and pre-treatment levels of cytokines in 47 patients were measured by chemical method and flow cytometry. The median follow-up was 23.1 months. The objective response and the disease control rates were 46.8% and 68.1%, while overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) were 12.6 and 11.4 months, respectively. Adverse events (2.1%) were grade 3-4. In addition to stage, intrahepatic metastasis and Child-Pugh score, pre-treatment interleukin-6 (IL-6) was the main cytokine affecting OS and PFS (p < 0.05). The OS (14.63 pg/mL as cutoff value) and PFS (9.85 pg/mL as cutoff value) of patients with low IL-6 levels exceeded those with high levels (21.0 and 6.9, 15.8 and 10.0 months, respectively). The risks of death and disease progression were reduced by 63.0% (HR = 0.37, 95% CI: 0.19-0.72) and 43.0% (HR = 0.57, 95% CI: 0.22-1.47), respectively.

63,A Phase II Study of Optimized Individualized Adaptive Radiotherapy for Hepatocellular Carcinoma.,10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-23-1044,"PURPOSE: We hypothesized that optimizing the utility of stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) based on the individual patient's probability for tumor control and risk of liver injury would decrease toxicity without sacrificing local control in patients with impaired liver function or tumors not amenable to thermal ablation. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients with Child-Pugh (CP) A to B7 liver function with aggregate tumor size >3.5 cm, or CP ≥ B8 with any size tumor were prospectively enrolled on an Institutional Review Board-approved phase II clinical trial to undergo SBRT with baseline and midtreatment dose optimization using a quantitative, individualized utility-based analysis. Primary endpoints were change in CP score of ≥2 points within 6 months and local control. Protocol-treated patients were compared with patients receiving conventional SBRT at another cancer center using overlap weighting. RESULTS: A total of 56 patients with 80 treated tumors were analyzed with a median follow-up of 11.2 months. Two-year cumulative incidence of local progression was 6.4% [95% confidence interval (CI, 2.4-13.4)]. Twenty-one percent of patients experienced treatment-related toxicity within 6 months, which is similar to the rate for SBRT in patients with CP A liver function. An analysis using overlap weighting revealed similar local control [HR, 0.69; 95% CI (0.25-1.91); P = 0.48] and decreased toxicity [OR, 0.26; 95% CI (0.07-0.99); P = 0.048] compared with conventional SBRT.

64,Development and validation of nomograms to evaluate the survival outcome of HCC patients undergoing selective postoperative adjuvant TACE.,10.1007/s11547-024-01792-0,"PURPOSE: The objective of this study was to develop and validate a novel prognostic nomogram to evaluate the survival benefit of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients receiving postoperative adjuvant transarterial chemoembolization (PA-TACE). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Clinical data of HCC patients who underwent hepatectomy at four medical centers were retrospectively analyzed, including those who received PA-TACE and those who did not. These two categories of patients were randomly allocated to the development and validation cohorts in a 7:3 ratio. RESULTS: A total of 1505 HCC patients who underwent hepatectomy were included in this study, comprising 723 patients who did not receive PA-TACE and 782 patients who received PA-TACE. Among them, patients who received PA-TACE experienced more adverse events, although these events were mild and manageable (Grade 1-2, all p < 0.05). Nomograms were constructed and validated for patients with and without PA-TACE using independent predictors that influenced disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS). These two nomograms had C-indices greater than 0.800 in the development cohort and exhibited good calibration and discrimination ability compared to six conventional HCC staging systems. Patients in the intermediate-to-high-risk group in the nomogram who received PA-TACE had higher DFS and OS (all p < 0.05). In addition, tumor recurrence was significantly controlled in the intermediate-to-high-risk group of patients who received PA-TACE, while there was no significant difference in the low-risk group of patients who received PA-TACE. CONCLUSION: The nomograms were developed and validated based on large-scale clinical data and can serve as online decision-making tools to predict survival benefits from PA-TACE in different subgroups of patients.",He Y; Qian J; Zhu G; Wu Z; Cui L; Tu S; Luo L; Shan R; Liu L; Shen W; Li Y; He K
65,Machine learning methods for accurately predicting survival and guiding treatment in stage I and II hepatocellular carcinoma.,10.1097/MD.0000000000035892,"Accurately predicting survival in patients with early hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is essential for making informed decisions about treatment and prognosis. Herein, we have developed a machine learning (ML) model that can predict patient survival and guide treatment decisions. We obtained patient demographic information, tumor characteristics, and treatment details from the SEER database. To analyze the data, we employed a Cox proportional hazards (CoxPH) model as well as 3 ML algorithms: neural network multitask logistic regression (N-MLTR), DeepSurv, and random survival forest (RSF). Our evaluation relied on the concordance index (C-index) and Integrated Brier Score (IBS). Additionally, we provided personalized treatment recommendations regarding surgery and chemotherapy choices and validated models' efficacy. A total of 1136 patients with early-stage (I, II) hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) who underwent liver resection or transplantation were randomly divided into training and validation cohorts at a ratio of 3:7. Feature selection was conducted using Cox regression analyses. The ML models (NMLTR: C-index = 0.6793; DeepSurv: C-index = 0.7028; RSF: C-index = 0.6890) showed better discrimination in predicting survival than the standard CoxPH model (C-index = 0.6696). Patients who received recommended treatments had higher survival rates than those who received unrecommended treatments. ML-based surgery treatment recommendations yielded higher hazard ratios (HRs): NMTLR HR = 0.36 (95% CI: 0.25-0.51, P < .001), DeepSurv HR = 0.34 (95% CI: 0.24-0.49, P < .001), and RSF HR = 0.37 (95% CI: 0.26-0.52, P = <.001). Chemotherapy treatment recommendations were associated with significantly improved survival for DeepSurv (HR: 0.57; 95% CI: 0.4-0.82, P = .002) and RSF (HR: 0.66; 95% CI: 0.46-0.94, P = .020). The ML survival model has the potential to benefit prognostic evaluation and treatment of HCC. This novel analytical approach could provide reliable information on individual survival and treatment recommendations.",Li X; Bao H; Shi Y; Zhu W; Peng Z; Yan L; Chen J; Shu X

This study evaluates the potential of CEUS-CT/MRI fusion imaging (FI) to improve tumor visibility and the associated RFA outcomes for small (≤ 3 cm) malignant liver tumors that were inconspicuous on US. METHODS: Between January 2019 and April 2021, a prospective study enrolled 248 patients with liver malignancies (≤ 3 cm) that were poorly visible on B-mode US. Tumor visibility and ablation feasibility were assessed using B-mode US, US-CT/MRI FI, and CEUS-CT/MRI FI, and graded on a 4-point scale. CEUS was employed post-registration of US and CT/MRI images, utilizing either SonoVue or Sonazoid. Comparisons between US-based and CEUS-based fusion visibility and feasibility scores were undertaken using the Friedman test. Moreover, rates of technical success, technique efficacy, local tumor progression (LTP), and major complications were assessed. RESULTS: The cohort included 223 hepatocellular carcinomas (HCCs) (89.9%) and 23 metastases (9.3%), with an average tumor size of 1.6 cm. CEUS-CT/MRI FI demonstrated a significant advantage in tumor visibility (3.4 ± 0.7 vs. 1.9 ± 0.6, P < 0.001) and technical feasibility (3.6 ± 0.6 vs. 2.9 ± 0.8, P < 0.001) compared to US-FI. In 85.5% of patients, CEUS addition to US-FI ameliorated tumor visibility. Technical success was achieved in 99.6% of cases. No severe complications were reported. One and two-year post CEUS-CT/MRI FI-guided RFA estimates for LTP were 9.3% and 10.9%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: CEUS-CT/MRI FI significantly improves the visualization of tumors not discernible on B-mode US, thus augmenting percutaneous RFA success and delivering improved therapeutic outcomes.

67,Adjuvant holmium-166 radioembolization after radiofrequency ablation in early-stage hepatocellular carcinoma patients: a dose-finding study (HORA EST HCC trial).,10.1007/s00259-024-06630-z,"PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to investigate the biodistribution of (super-)selective trans-arterial radioembolization (TARE) with holmium-166 microspheres ((166)Ho-MS), when administered as adjuvant therapy after RFA of HCC 2-5 cm. The objective was to establish a treatment volume absorbed dose that results in an absorbed dose of ≥ 120 Gy on the hyperemic zone around the ablation necrosis (i.e., target volume). METHODS: In this multicenter, prospective dose-escalation study in BCLC early stage HCC patients with lesions 2-5 cm, RFA was followed by (super-)selective infusion of (166)Ho-MS on day 5-10 after RFA. Dose distribution within the treatment volume was based on SPECT-CT. Cohorts of up to 10 patients were treated with an incremental dose (60 Gy, 90 Gy, 120 Gy) of (166)Ho-MS to the treatment volume. The primary endpoint was to obtain a target volume dose of ≥ 120 Gy in 9/10 patients within a cohort. RESULTS: Twelve patients were treated (male 10; median age, 66.5 years (IQR, [64.3-71.7])) with a median tumor diameter of 2.7 cm (IQR, [2.1-4.0]). At a treatment volume absorbed dose of 90 Gy, the primary endpoint was met with a median absorbed target volume dose of 138 Gy (IQR, [127-145]). No local recurrences were found within 1-year follow-up. CONCLUSION: Adjuvant (super-)selective infusion of (166)Ho-MS after RFA for the treatment of HCC can be administered safely at a dose of 90 Gy to the treatment volume while reaching a dose of ≥ 120 Gy to the target volume and may be a favorable adjuvant therapy for HCC lesions 2-5 cm.

68,"Efficacy and safety of atezolizumab/bevacizumab in patients with HCC after prior systemic therapy: A global, observational study.",10.1097/HC9.0000000000000302,"BACKGROUND: Since the introduction of the combination treatment of anti-programmed death-ligand 1 antibody atezolizumab and anti-VEGF antibody bevacizumab (AB), median overall survival in HCC has drastically improved. However, evidence on the efficacy and safety of the novel treatment standard in patients with prior exposure to systemic treatment is scarce. The aim of this global, multicenter, observational study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of AB in patients after previous systemic therapy. METHODS: We screened our global, multicenter, prospectively maintained registry database for patients who received any systemic therapy before AB. The primary end point was overall survival; secondary end points were time-to-progression, progression-free survival, objective response rate, and safety (rate and severity of adverse events). RESULTS: Among 493 patients who received AB for unresectable HCC, 61 patients received prior systemic therapy and were included in this analysis. The median age of the study population was 66 years, with 91.8% males. Predominant risk factors for HCC were viral hepatitis (59%) and alcohol (23%). Overall survival for AB was 16.2 (95% CI, 14.5-17.9) months, time-to-progression and progression-free survival were 4.1 (95% CI, 1.5-6.6) and 3.1 (95% CI, 1.1-5.1) months, respectively. The objective response rate was 38.2% (7.3% with complete and 30.9% with partial response). Overall survival was not influenced by treatment line (2nd vs. >2nd) or previous systemic treatment modality (tyrosine kinase inhibitors vs. immune checkpoint inhibitors). Treatment-related adverse events of all grades according to Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events were documented in 42.6% of patients, with only 13.1% of grade ≥3, including one death.

HCRN GI15-225 is an open-label, single-arm multicenter, pilot study (NCT03099564). METHODS: Eligible patients had poor prognosis, localized HCC defined as having portal vein thrombus, multifocal disease, and/or diffuse disease that were not eligible for liver transplant or surgical resection. Patients received pembrolizumab 200 mg intravenously every 3 weeks in conjunction with glass yttrium-90 (Y90) radioembolization TheraSphere. Primary endpoint was 6-month progression-free survival (PFS6) per RECIST 1.1. Secondary endpoints included time to progression (TTP), objective response rate (ORR), overall survival (OS), and safety/tolerability. RESULTS: Between October 23, 2017 and November 24, 2020, 29 patients were enrolled: 2 were excluded per protocol. Fifteen of the remaining 27 patients were free of progression at 6 months (55.6%; 95% CI, 35.3-74.5) with median PFS 9.95 months (95% CI, 4.14-15.24) and OS 27.30 months (95% CI, 10.15-39.52).

71,Evaluation of the interest to combine a CD4 Th1-inducer cancer vaccine derived from telomerase and atezolizumab plus bevacizumab in unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma: a randomized non-comparative phase II study (TERTIO - PRODIGE 82).,10.1186/s12885-023-11065-0,"BACKGROUND: Several cancer immunotherapies that target the PD-L1/PD-1 pathway show promising clinical activity in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). However, the standard of care in first-line treatment with atezolizumab (anti-PD-L1 therapy) in combination with bevacizumab is associated with a limited objective response rate. Telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT) activation meets the criteria of oncogenic addiction in HCC and could be actionable therapeutic target and a relevant tumor antigen. Therefore we hypothesized that combining anti-PD-1/PD-L1 therapy with an anti-telomerase vaccine might be an attractive therapy in HCC. UCPVax is a therapeutic cancer vaccine composed of two separate peptides derived from telomerase (human TERT). UCPVax has been evaluated in a multicenter phase I/II study in non-small cell lung cancers and has demonstrated to be safe and immunogenic, and is under evaluation in combination with atezolizumab in a phase II clinical trial in tumors where telomerase reactivation contributes to an oncogene addiction (HPV(+) cancers). The aim of the TERTIO study is to determine the clinical interest and immunological efficacy of a treatment combining the CD4 helper T-inducer cancer anti-telomerase vaccine (UCPVax) with atezolizumab and bevacizumab in unresectable HCC in a multicenter randomized phase II study. METHODS: Patients with locally advanced, metastatic or unresectable HCC who have not previously received systemic anti-cancer treatment are eligible. The primary end point is the objective response rate at 6 months. Patients will be allocated to a treatment arm with a randomization 2:1. In both arms, patients will receive atezolizumab at fixed dose of 1200 mg IV infusion and bevacizumab at fixed dose of 15 mg/kg IV infusion, every 3 weeks, according to the standard of care. In the experimental arm, these treatments will be combined with the UCPVax vaccine at 0.5 mg subcutaneously. DISCUSSION: Combining anti-PD-1/PD-L1 therapy with an anti-telomerase vaccine gains serious consideration in HCC, in order to extend the clinical efficacy of anti-PD-1/PD-L1. Indeed, anti-cancer vaccines can induce tumor-specific T cell expansion and activation and therefore restore the cancer-immunity cycle in patients lacking pre-existing anti-tumor responses. Thus, there is a strong rational to combine immune checkpoint blockade therapy and anticancer vaccine (UCPVax) in order to activate antitumor T cell immunity and bypass the immunosuppression in the tumor microenvironment in HCC. This pivotal proof of concept study will evaluate the efficacy and safety of the combination of a CD4 Th1-inducer cancer vaccine derived from telomerase (UCPVax) and atezolizumab plus bevacizumab in unresectable HCC, as well as confirming their synergic mechanism, and settling the basis for a new combination for future clinical trials.

However, TACE efficacy is controversial in the presence of portal vein thrombosis (PVT). Although transarterial radioembolization (TARE) benefit was previously documented in PVT, neither the objective tumor response (OTR) after TARE with Iodine-131-lipiodol ((131)I-lipiodol) nor the PVT effect on the results of locoregional therapies was accurately measured in prospective clinical trials. The aim of this study was to compare OTR and survival obtained by TARE with (131)I-lipiodol versus TACE in patients with cirrhosis and HCC, as well as between those with and without PVT. MATERIALS AND METHODS: 33 patients were included, from whom 38 tumors were assessed. OTR was quantified by a special algorithm to measure hypervascular HCC tissue. RESULTS: 19 tumors received each therapy. Nine subjects (27%) had PVT, most of them in the TARE group (p = 0.026). Mean OTR according to the tumor volumes was 24.2% ± 56% after TARE and 32.8% ± 48.9% after TACE, with no difference between the treatments (p = 0.616). Similar values were also observed between those with and without PVT (p = 0.704). Mean survival was 340 days and did not differ between the two treatments (p = 0.596), but was 194 days in PVT cases (p = 0.007). CONCLUSIONS: This is the first study in which OTR obtained by TARE with (131)I-lipiodol is accurately measured. Additionally, PVT impact on survival after TARE and TACE was precisely documented. Although the TARE group had more PVT subjects (who had shorter survival), TARE and TACE achieved similar OTR and OS rates. Elsevier Inc.

73,Combining stereotactic body radiotherapy with camrelizumab for unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma: a single-arm trial.,10.1007/s12072-022-10396-7,"PURPOSE: Stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) may have significant immunomodulatory effects that enhance tumor response to immune checkpoint inhibitors. This phase 2 clinical trial was conducted to evaluate the safety and efficacy of combining palliative SBRT with camrelizumab (an anti-PD1 monoclonal antibody) in patients with unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (uHCC). METHODS: Patients with uHCC, Child-Pugh A/B liver function, and at least one measurable lesion were enrolled between April 2020 and August 2022. Patients were administered 200 mg camrelizumab intravenously from the first day of palliative SBRT and then every 3 weeks. Palliative SBRT was delivered daily over five fractions per week, with a dose range of 30-50 Gy. The primary endpoints were objective response rate (ORR) and safety. This trial was registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT04193696). RESULTS: Twenty-one patients were enrolled; the median radiation dose was 40 Gy, and the median number of cycles of camrelizumab was five. The ORR was 52.4%. After a median follow-up of 19.7 months, the median progression-free and overall survival were 5.8 and 14.2 months, respectively. The overall survival probability was 85.7% at 6 months, 76.2% at 9 months, and 59.9% at 12 months. All grade 3 treatment-related adverse events (TRAEs) occurred in five patients (23.8%) and were manageable. No grade 4/5 TRAEs were observed. CONCLUSION: Palliative SBRT plus camrelizumab showed promising antitumor activity against uHCC. Toxicities were manageable with no unexpected safety issues. This study provides evidence of a new therapeutic method for the treatment of uHCC.",Li JX; Su TS; Gong WF; Zhong JH; Yan LY; Zhang J; Li LQ; He ML; Zhang RJ; Du YQ; Wang XT; Liang SX; Xiang BD
74,Evaluation of the Contrast-Enhanced Ultrasound Nonradiation Treatment Response Assessment LI-RADS v2024 Using Data From a Multi-Center Transarterial Chemoembolization Study.,10.1016/j.acra.2024.06.005,"RATIONALE AND OBJECTIVE: Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) locoregional treatment response is commonly evaluated using the Modified Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors and the American College of Radiology (ACR) Liver Reporting and Data System (LI-RADS) Treatment Response Assessment (TRA) for MRI/CT. This study aims to evaluate the diagnostic performance of the new ACR contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) Nonradiation TRA LI-RADS v2024 in HCC treated with transarterial chemoembolization (TACE). MATERIALS AND METHODS: This retrospective observational study included 87 patients treated with TACE from a previously reported cohort. At 15- and 30-days post-treatment, 68 and 72 HCC lesions were evaluated. Three blinded radiologists with different levels of CEUS experience interpreted the images independently. According to CEUS Nonradiation TRA LI-RADSv2024, both intralesional and perilesional tumor viability were evaluated and final TRA categories were as follows: TR-Nonviable, TR-Equivocal, and TR-Viable. The reference standard used was a composite of histology and imaging. RESULTS: 140 HCC lesions were analyzed. At 15 days post-treatment, the sensitivity (SN), specificity (SP), positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV), and accuracy of TR-Viable classification ranged from 72.5-94.3%, 72.2-86.4%, 86.8-91.4%, 65.6-86.7%, 76.9-86.8%, respectively. At 30 days post-treatment, the SN, PPV, and NPV of TR-Viable classification decreased, ranging from 65.9-84.2%, 85.7-90.6%, and 59.5-73.9%, respectively, while the SP increased, ranging from 80.0-88.0%. Kappa values ranged from 0.557-0.730, indicating moderate to substantial agreement. CONCLUSION: CEUS Nonradiation TRA LI-RADS is a reliable tool for the detection of viable tumors in lesions treated with TACE and demonstrates reproducibility across readers. Elsevier Inc.

75,Effect of camrelizumab plus transarterial chemoembolization on massive hepatocellular carcinoma.,10.1016/j.clinre.2021.101851,"OBJECTIVE: To investigate the efficacy of camrelizumab plus transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) on massive hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients. METHODS: A total of 92 cases with massive HCC from October 2019 to January 2021 were prospectively enrolled and randomly divided into the study group (n = 46) and the control group (n = 46). The control group received TACE while the study group were treated with camrelizumab plus TACE. The primary end points were clinical efficacy and adverse events. And the secondary end points were liver function, and alpha fetoprotein (AFP), carcino-embryonic antigen (CEA), carbohydrate antigen 19-9 (CA19-9) levels before and after treatment. RESULTS: All participants were followed-up for 7 to 24 months, with a median of 12 months. Patients in the study group received TACE for 1-3 times, with an average of (2.01 ± 0.09) times, while patients in the control group receive TACE for 2-4 times, with an average of (3.78 ± 0.12) times, and the control group received significantly more TACEs (χ(2) = 5.518, P = 0.019). During the follow-up, the response rate and disease control rate of the study group were significantly higher than those of the control group (χ(2) = 5.518, P = 0.019; χ(2) = 4.467, P = 0.041). Before treatment, the levels of total bilirubin (TBIL), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alpha-fetoprotein (AFP), CEA, and CA19-9 were comparable between the groups (P > 0.05). After treatment, the levels of TBIL, ALT, AST, AFP, CEA, and CA19-9 decreased, and the above indicators in the study group were significantly lower than those in the control group (P < 0.05). All patients showed transient liver damage, vomiting, nausea, fever and abdominal pain after surgery, and their symptoms were relieved after symptomatic treatment. Adverse events occurred in 9 cases in the study group, and 3 cases in the control group (χ(2) = 3.419, P = 0.064). CONCLUSION: Compared with TACE alone, camrelizumab plus TACE treatment can significantly improve the liver function of patients with massive HCC and enhance the treatment effect, which is worthy of clinical promotion.",Zhang S; Zhao Y; He L; Bo C; An Y; Li N; Ma W; Guo Y; Guo Y; Zhang C
76,Adjuvant stereotactic body radiotherapy after marginal resection for hepatocellular carcinoma with microvascular invasion: A randomised controlled trial.,10.1016/j.ejca.2022.02.012,"BACKGROUND: Marginal resection frequently occurred in hepatectomy for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), leading to increased local recurrence, especially among patients with microvascular invasion (MVI). Stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) showed effectiveness in controlling tumour and tumour thrombosis. This study aimed to investigate the efficacy of SBRT, targeting on suboptimal resection margin, as adjuvant setting in MVI-positive HCC. METHODS: This was a single-centre randomised controlled trial conducted in Eastern Hepatobiliary Surgery Hospital, Shanghai, China. Participants with MVI-positive HCC receiving marginal resection were randomly assigned to the postoperative adjuvant SBRT or surgery alone (SA) group. SBRT was delivered by the CyberKnife® system with marker tracking devices, targeting on resection margin one month after surgery. The disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS) were compared between the groups, and the adverse events (AEs) were monitored. This trial was registered on ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04891874. FINDINGS: A total of 76 participants were enrolled, with 38 in each group. The one-, three-, and five-year DFS rates were 92.1%, 65.8%, and 56.1% in SBRT group versus 76.3%, 36.8%, and 26.3% in SA group, respectively (p = 0.005). The one-, three-, and five-year OS rates were 100%, 89.5%, and 75.0% in SBRT group versus 100.0%, 68.4%, and 53.7% in SA group, respectively (p = 0.053). The total dose of SBRT for single participant was 35 Gy, and the biological effective dose (BED) was 59.5 Gy. The overall incidence of radiotherapy-related AE was 31.6% (12/38), and no grade 3 or higher grade AE was developed. INTERPRETATION: SBRT on the resection margin provides a safe therapeutic modality of adjuvant setting in MVI-positive HCC with suboptimal resection margin. It prevents local recurrence and improves DFS. TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: NCT04891874.",Shi C; Li Y; Geng L; Shen W; Sui C; Dai B; Lu J; Pan M; Yang J
77,Sequential Therapy with Ropeginterferon Alfa-2b and Anti-Programmed Cell Death 1 Antibody for Inhibiting the Recurrence of Hepatitis B-Related Hepatocellular Carcinoma: From Animal Modeling to Phase I Clinical Results.,10.3390/ijms25010433,"Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) usually recurs after curative surgical resection. Currently, no approved adjuvant therapy has been shown to reduce HCC recurrence rates. In this study, the in vivo effect of sequential combination treatment with recombinant mouse interferon-alpha (rmIFN-α) and an anti-mouse-PD1 antibody on hepatitis B virus (HBV) clearance in mice was evaluated. A Phase I clinical trial was then conducted to assess the safety, tolerability, and inhibitory activity of sequential therapy with ropeginterferon alfa-2b and nivolumab in patients with HCC recurrence who underwent curative surgery for HBV-related HCC. The animal modeling study showed that HBV suppression was significantly greater with the rmIFN-α and anti-PD1 sequential combination treatment in comparison with sole treatment with rmIFN-α or anti-PD1. In the Phase I study, eleven patients completed the sequential therapy with ropeginterferon alfa-2b every two weeks for six doses at 450 µg, followed by three doses of nivolumab every two weeks up to 0.75 mg/kg. A notable decrease in or clearance of HBV surface antigen was observed in two patients. The dose-limiting toxicity of grade 3 alanine transaminase and aspartate aminotransferase increases was observed in one patient. The maximum tolerated dose was then determined. To date, no HCC recurrence has been observed. The treatment modality was well tolerated. These data support the further clinical development of sequential combination therapy as a post-surgery prophylactic measure against the recurrence of HBV-related HCC.",Qin A; Wu CR; Ho MC; Tsai CY; Chen PJ
78,Nonadherence to oral cancer chemotherapy in hepatocellular carcinoma: prevalence and predictive factors in Vietnam.,10.1186/s12885-024-12601-2,"PURPOSE: Standard oral cancer chemotherapy (OCT) or targeted therapy (OTT) has expanded the treatment methods for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). However, its principal nonadherence causes a reduction in efficacy. We aimed to evaluate the status of nonadherence and influencing factors among outpatient patients with HCC. PATIENTS AND METHODS: In 2021, a prospective observational study was conducted on 384 patients with either old or newly diagnosed HCC treated with OTT. Nonadherence to OCT was determined using the eight-item Morisky Medication Adherence Scale, with a score < 6 points. The patients were finished with a six-month follow-up investigation by questionnaires. RESULTS: 54,8% of HCC outpatients were nonadherent to OCT, with a mean Morisky score of 5.19. They dropped out of the treatment mainly because of drug side effects, such as fatigue (72.4%), hand-foot syndrome (42.7%), diarrhea (38.3%), nausea (25%), insomnia (24.7%), abdominal pain (12%), and anxiety about these adverse events (65.9%). Additionally, financial difficulties and low relative copayments were significantly correlated with the noncompliant treatment of patients (OR = 2.29, 95% CI = 1.32-3.98, P = 0.003; OR = 4.36, 95% CI = 0.95-19.93, P = 0.039, respectively). Moreover, inadequate individual information about the clinical course, the art of treatment, and medication usage instructions were suggestive barriers to adherence to treatment (OR = 1.96, 95% CI = 1.08-3.55, P = 0.024; OR = 1.86, 95% CI = 1.1-3.14, P = 0.02; OR = 2.34, 95% CI = 1.29-4.26, P = 0.004, respectively). Finally, a low level of trust in doctors was an essential factor in nonadherence (Mean of the Anderson Trust in Physician Scale scores counted 38.12 vs. 43.97, respectively for non-adherence vs. adherence, P = 0.00001). CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests a high rate of primary nonadherence to standard oral targeted therapy among HCC outpatient patients because of drug side effects, patient awareness of treatment, and lack of confidence in healthcare providers. Close supervision, proper medication instructions, appropriate dosage reductions, and comprehensive patient counseling might be necessary to control nonadherence.",Ky TD; Loan NT; Thinh NT; Binh MT
79,Efficacy and safety of SBRT combined with sintilimab and IBI305 in patients with advanced HCC and previously failed immunotherapy: study protocol of a phase 2 clinical trial.,10.1136/bmjopen-2023-077903,"INTRODUCTION: Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a leading cause of cancer-related death in China. The combination of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) and antiangiogenic drugs, such as bevacizumab and tyrosine kinase inhibitors, has been recommended as first-line treatment for advanced HCC. However, two-thirds of patients did not benefit from this form of immunotherapy. Currently, data on the subsequent regimen for patients previously treated with ICIs are lacking. Studies have shown that the combination of radiotherapy (RT) and ICIs is a potentially effective second-line therapy for HCC. This study aims to assess the efficacy and safety of combined therapy with stereotactic body RT (SBRT), sintilimab and IBI305 (a biosimilar of bevacizumab) in patients with HCC following the progression of first-line ICI therapy. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: This study is an open-label, single-arm, single-centre, phase 2 trial of 21 patients with advanced HCC in whom previous ICI therapy has failed. Participants will receive approximately 30-40 Gy/5-8F SBRT, followed by 200 mg sintilimab and 15 mg/kg IBI305 intravenously every 3 weeks. Treatment will continue until the development of unacceptable toxicity or disease progression. We will use Simon's two-stage design, with the objective response rate (ORR) as the primary endpoint. Secondary endpoints include ORR of lesions without RT, disease control rate, progression-free survival, overall survival and safety.

80,GALNT14 genotype-guided chemoembolization plus sorafenib therapy in hepatocellular carcinoma: a randomized trial.,10.1007/s12072-021-10283-7,"BACKGROUND: GALNT14-rs9679162 ""TT"" genotype is associated with favorable clinical outcomes in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) treated by transarterial chemoembolization (TACE). We investigated whether patients with GALNT14-rs9679162 ""non-TT"" unfavorable genotype benefited from chemoembolization plus sorafenib combination therapy. METHODS: Intermediate stage HCC patients were recruited for GALNT14-rs9679162 genotyping before TACE. Patients with ""TT"" genotype received only TACE, labeled as TT (TACE) group. Patients with ""non-TT"" genotype (""GG"" or ""GT"") were randomized to receive either TACE alone, labeled as Non-TT (TACE) group, or TACE plus sorafenib, labeled as Non-TT (TACE + Sora) group. The latter group received sorafenib 400 mg daily plus TACE. RESULTS: From October 2015 to April 2019, 103 HCC patients scheduled to receive chemoembolization were screened. Of them, 84 met inclusion criteria and were assigned to TT (TACE) (n = 25), Non-TT (TACE) (n = 30) and Non-TT (TACE + Sora) (n = 29) groups according to their GALNT14 genotypes. Repeated TACE sessions were performed on-demand and patients were followed until November 2020. It was found that TT (TACE) and Non-TT (TACE + Sora) patients had shorter time-to-complete response compared with that in Non-TT (TACE) patients (p < 0.001 and 0.009, respectively). These two groups also had longer time-to-TACE progression (p < 0.001 and 0.006, respectively) and longer progression-free survival (p = 0.001 and 0.021, respectively). However, TT (TACE) patients harbored longer overall survival compared with those in non-TT (TACE + Sora) and non-TT (TACE) patients (p = 0.028, < 0.001, respectively). CONCLUSION: Combination of sorafenib and TACE for ""non-TT"" patients partially overcame the genetic disadvantage on treatment outcomes in terms of time-to-complete response, time-to-TACE progression and progression-free survival.

81,Phase 1 Randomized Trial of Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy Followed by Nivolumab plus Ipilimumab or Nivolumab Alone in Advanced/Unresectable Hepatocellular Carcinoma.,10.1016/j.ijrobp.2022.09.052,"PURPOSE: Immunotherapy has emerged as a promising therapeutic option for advanced or unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). However, survival remains poor with only a subset of patients deriving benefit. This trial investigated the safety and efficacy of stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) with immunotherapy in HCC. METHODS AND MATERIALS: In this multicenter phase 1 randomized trial, patients with advanced or unresectable HCC received liver SBRT (40 Gy in 5 fractions) followed by either nivolumab alone or nivolumab plus ipilimumab. The primary endpoint was dose-limiting toxicity occurring within 6 months of SBRT. Secondary endpoints included overall response rate, progression-free survival, overall survival (OS), distant disease control, and local control of the irradiated tumor. Disease status and response endpoints were assessed radiographically every 8 weeks until progression or initiation of nonprotocol therapy. Response was determined using both RECIST (Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors) 1.1 and iRECIST. RESULTS: Fourteen patients were enrolled across 3 centers. Thirteen patients were evaluated for study endpoints. The study was closed early because of slow accrual. The median follow-up time was 42.7 months. Dose-limiting toxicities within 6 months occurred in 2 (15.4%) of 13 patients: 1 of 6 patients in the nivolumab arm (16.7%; 90% confidence interval [CI], 0.9%-58.2%) and 1 of 7 patients in the nivolumab plus ipilimumab arm (14.3%; 90% CI, 0.7%-52.1%). Grade 3 adverse events occurred in 8 (61.6%), 5 (71.4%), and 3 (50.0%) patients in the overall nivolumab plus ipilimumab and nivolumab cohorts. Grade 3 hepatotoxicity occurred in 4 (30.8%), 3 (42.9%), and 1 (16.7%) patients in the respective cohorts. Clinical outcomes favored the nivolumab plus ipilimumab arm compared with nivolumab alone, including an overall response rate of 57% (4 of 7 patients; 90% CI, 23%-87%) versus 0% (0 of 6 patients; 90% CI, 0%-39%), median progression-free survival of 11.6 months (90% CI, 4.5 months to not reached) versus 2.7 months (90% CI, 1.3-4.7 months), and median OS of 41.6 months (90% CI, 4.5 months to not reached) versus 4.7 months (90% CI, 2.0-16.2 months) (all P < .05). With combination immunotherapy, 3-year OS was 57% (90% CI, 23%-81%), with 2 patients alive after 42.7 months without progression and negative PET. CONCLUSIONS: In this first prospective trial investigating the combination of SBRT and immunotherapy for HCC, multimodal therapy demonstrated acceptable safety. SBRT with nivolumab plus ipilimumab compared favorably to outcomes of immunotherapy alone and warrants further investigation.",Juloori A; Katipally RR; Lemons JM; Singh AK; Iyer R; Robbins JR; George B; Hall WA; Pitroda SP; Arif F; Fung J; Pillai A; Liao CY; Sharma M; Liauw SL
82,Partial hepatectomy versus interventional treatment in patients with hepatitis B virus-related hepatocellular carcinoma and clinically significant portal hypertension: a randomized comparative clinical trial.,10.1002/cac2.12614,"BACKGROUND: The widely accepted view that portal hypertension (PHT) is a contraindication to hepatectomy for patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is being increasingly challenged. The long-term survival outcomes and safety of partial hepatectomy versus interventional treatment using ablation with or without pre-ablation transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) in patients with HBV-related HCC within the Milan criteria and with clinically significant PHT were compared in this study. METHODS: This open-label randomized clinical trial was conducted on consecutive patients with clinically PHT and hepatitis B virus (HBV)-related HCC with tumors which were within the Milan criteria. These patients were randomized 1:1 to receive either partial hepatectomy or interventional treatment between December 2012 and June 2018. The primary endpoint was overall survival (OS); secondary endpoints included recurrence-free survival (RFS) and therapeutic safety. RESULTS: Each of the 2 groups had 80 patients. The 1-, 3- and 5-year OS rates in the partial hepatectomy group and the interventional treatment group were 95.0%, 86.2%, 69.5% versus 93.8%, 77.5%, 64.9%, respectively (P = 0.325). The corresponding RFS rates were 78.8%, 55.0%, 46.2% versus 71.3%, 52.5%, 45.0%, respectively (P = 0.783). The partial hepatectomy group had a higher complication rate compared to the interventional group (67.5% vs. 20%, P < 0.001). However, the differences were mainly in Clavien-Dindo Grade I complications (P < 0.001), while not significant in Grade II/III/IV/V (All P > 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: This study shows that partial hepatectomy treatment did not meet prespecified significance for improved OS and RFS compared to interventional treatment for patients with HBV-related HCC within the Milan criteria and with clinically significant PHT. However, partial hepatectomy is still a safe procedure and should be considered as a treatment option rather than a contraindication.

BMS-986,205 is a novel oral drug that potently and selectively inhibits IDO. This Phase I/II study evaluated the safety and tolerability of BMS-986,205 in combination with nivolumab as first-line therapy in advanced HCC. METHODS: Adults with untreated, unresectable/metastatic HCC received BMS-986,205 at two dose levels (50-100 mg orally daily) in combination with fixed dose nivolumab (240mg/m(2) IV on Day 1 of each 14-day cycle). The primary objective was to determine the safety and tolerability of this combination; secondary objectives were to obtain preliminary efficacy. RESULTS: Eight patients received a total of 91 treatment cycles in the dose escalation phase. All patients were Child Pugh A and 6 patients had underlying viral hepatitis. In the 6 evaluable patients, no dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) were observed. The most common treatment-related adverse events (TRAEs) were aspartate transaminase (AST) and alanine transaminase (ALT) elevation (3 patients) and diarrhea, maculopapular rash and increased alkaline phosphatase (2 patients each). Grade 3 events were diarrhea and AST elevation (1 patient), and hyperglycemia and pancreatitis requiring treatment discontinuation (1 patient). No grade 4-5 events occurred. Partial response was observed in 1 patient (12.5%) and stable disease in 3 patients (37.5%), yielding a disease control rate of 50%. Median PFS was 8.5 weeks; median OS was not reached.

85,Comparison of drug-eluting bead with conventional transcatheter arterial chemoembolization for hepatocellular carcinoma with portal vein tumor thrombus: a randomized clinical trial.,10.1097/JS9.0000000000001691,"BACKGROUND: Drug-eluting bead transarterial chemoembolization (DEB-TACE) has shown efficacy for treating hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) with portal vein tumor thrombus (PVTT). However, whether DEB-TACE is superior to conventional TACE (cTACE) remains unclear. OBJECTIVE: This randomized controlled trial aimed to compare the efficacy and safety of DEB-TACE versus cTACE in treating HCC with PVTT. METHODS: The study was conducted at a tertiary care center in Southeast China. HCC patients with PVTT were randomized at a 1:1 ratio into the DEB-TACE or cTACE groups. The primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS), and the secondary endpoints were overall survival (OS) and the incidence of adverse events (AEs). An independent review committee assessed the radiologic response according to the modified Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (mRECIST). AEs were assessed by the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 4.0. Systemic therapies were not restricted. RESULTS: Between September 2018 and July 2020, 163 patients were randomized to undergo DEB-TACE ( n =82) or cTACE ( n =81). Nine patients were excluded, and 154 patients were included in the final analysis; the median age was 55 years (range, 24-78 years), and 140 (90.9%) were male. The median PFS in the DEB-TACE group was 6.0 months (95% CI, 5.0-10.0) versus 4.0 months (95% CI, 3.0-5.0) in the cTACE group (hazard ratio, 0.63; 95% CI, 0.42-0.95; P =0.027). The DEB-TACE group showed a higher response rate [51 (66.2%) vs. 36 (46.8%); P =0.0015] and a longer median OS [12.0 months (95% CI, 9.0-16.0) vs. 8.0 months (95% CI, 7.0-11.0), P =0.039] than the cTACE group. Multivariate analysis showed that the treatment group, ALBI score, distant metastasis and additional TKIs were the four independent prognostic factors correlated with PFS. In addition, the treatment group, PVTT group and combination with surgery were independently associated with OS. AEs were similar in the two groups, and postembolization syndrome was the most frequent AE. CONCLUSION: DEB-TACE is superior to cTACE in treating HCC patients with PVTT, demonstrating improved PFS and OS with an acceptable safety profile, and may thus emerge as a promising treatment strategy for HCC patients with PVTT.

86,Improving Adjuvant Liver-Directed Treatment Recommendations for Unresectable Hepatocellular Carcinoma: An Artificial Intelligence-Based Decision-Making Tool.,10.1200/CCI.22.00024,"PURPOSE: Liver-directed therapy after transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) can lead to improvement in survival for selected patients with unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). However, there is uncertainty in the appropriate application and modality of therapy in current clinical practice guidelines. The aim of this study was to develop a proof-of-concept, machine learning (ML) model for treatment recommendation in patients previously treated with TACE and select patients who might benefit from additional treatment with combination stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) or radiofrequency ablation (RFA). METHODS: This retrospective observational study was based on data from an urban, academic hospital system selecting for patients diagnosed with stage I-III HCC from January 1, 2008, to December 31, 2018, treated with TACE, followed by adjuvant RFA, SBRT, or no additional liver-directed modality. A feedforward, ML ensemble model provided a treatment recommendation on the basis of pairwise assessments evaluating each potential treatment option and estimated benefit in survival. RESULTS: Two hundred thirty-seven patients met inclusion criteria, of whom 54 (23%) and 49 (21%) received combination of TACE and SBRT or TACE and RFA, respectively. The ML model suggested a different consolidative modality in 32.7% of cases among patients who had previously received combination treatment. Patients treated in concordance with model recommendations had significant improvement in progression-free survival (hazard ratio 0.5; P = .007). The most important features for model prediction were cause of cirrhosis, stage of disease, and albumin-bilirubin grade (a measure of liver function). CONCLUSION: In this proof-of-concept study, an ensemble ML model was able to provide treatment recommendations for HCC who had undergone prior TACE. Additional treatment in line with model recommendations was associated with significant improvement in progression-free survival, suggesting a potential benefit for ML-guided medical decision making.",Mo A; Velten C; Jiang JM; Tang J; Ohri N; Kalnicki S; Mirhaji P; Nemoto K; Aasman B; Garg M; Guha C; Brodin NP; Kabarriti R

This phase Ib study aims to explore the safety and clinical efficacy of intraperitoneal anti-programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) antibody in these patients. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients received sintilimab 100 mg intraperitoneally plus best supportive care on days 1, 8, and 15 in three cycles of 4 weeks. The course was repeated every 28 days until intolerable toxicity had developed or disease progression. The primary endpoint was safety, while the secondary endpoints were objective response rate (ORR), ascites control rate (ACR), and overall survival (OS). RESULTS: From February 2021 through November 2022, a total of 21 patients (14 hepatocellular carcinoma and 7 cholangiocarcinoma) were enrolled to receive intraperitoneal sintilimab. Twelve patients had adverse events (AEs). The most common grade 3 AEs were fatigue, rash, and abdominal pain. No grade ≥4 AEs occurred in any patients. ORR was only evaluated in 13 patients, including partial response in 4, stable disease in 7, and progressive disease in 2. A reduction in the median maximum diameter of the tumor after treatment was observed; however, there was no statistical significance among patients. The objective remission rate of ascites was 43.75%, and the median OS for all 21 patients was 17.6 weeks. CONCLUSIONS: This exploratory study represents the first trial to demonstrate the safety and clinical efficacy of intraperitoneal anti-PD-1 antibody administration. No unexpected safety concerns were identified. A large, multicenter, prospective study is needed to confirm the promising clinical efficacy.",Chen C; Li Z; Xiong X; Yao A; Wang S; Liu X; Liu X; Wang J

The role of neoadjuvant radiotherapy (RT) in treating patients with an early-stage HCC predicted to have high risks of MVI remains to be explored. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Consecutive patients with a resectable single and small (≤5 cm) hepatitis B virus-related HCC predicted to have high risks of MVI were randomized 1:1 to receive either neoadjuvant intensity modulated radiation therapy (18 Gy with fractionated doses of 3 Gy) followed by surgery 4 weeks later or upfront surgery. The primary endpoint was disease-free survival (DFS). The secondary outcomes included overall survival (OS), objective response rate, RT-related toxicity and surgical complications. RESULTS: There were 30 patients randomized to each of the two groups. In the neoadjuvant RT group, three patients violated the study protocol, with two having upfront hepatectomy and one radiofrequency ablation after RT. The objective response rate after RT was 25.0% (7/28), but 2 patients suffered from grade 3 liver toxicity. The median follow-up was 68 months (interquartile range, 58-70 months) in the neoadjuvant RT group, and 68 months (interquartile range, 62-75 months) in the upfront surgery group. On intention-to-treat analysis, the median DFS and median OS were not reached in both the 2 arms. The 1-year, 2-year, 3-year and 5-year DFS rates for the neoadjuvant RT group were 86.7%, 76.7%, 60.0% and 56.3%, versus 90.0%, 66.7%, 52.8% and 45.7% in the upfront surgery group ( P =0.448), respectively. The corresponding OS rates were 96.7%, 86.7%, 83.3% and 72.7%, versus 100.0%, 93.3%, 79.6% and 60.7% ( P = 0.399). CONCLUSION AND RELEVANCE: For patients with a resectable single and small hepatitis B virus-related HCC predicted to have high risks of MVI, neoadjuvant RT gave a promising response rate with a mild toxicity. Nevertheless, the neoadjuvant RT yielded similar long-term DFS and OS rates compared with patients who underwent upfront surgery.",Wei X; Jiang Y; Feng S; Lu C; Huo L; Zhou B; Meng Y; Lau WY; Zheng Y; Cheng S
89,Combination Transarterial Chemoembolization and Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy for Unresectable Single Large Hepatocellular Carcinoma: Results From a Prospective Phase 2 Trial.,10.1016/j.ijrobp.2022.05.021,"PURPOSE: Patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) at Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC) early-stage A (BCLC A) not suitable for surgery are first considered for ablation. Nonetheless, objective responses and long-term results for ablation in tumors larger than 3 to 4 cm are suboptimal, creating an unmet clinical need. This phase 2 trial studied combination of transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) and stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) for BCLC A patients with a solitary HCC from 4 to 7 cm. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Eligible patients were BCLC A, Child-Pugh score ≤7, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status 0 presenting with a single HCC from 4 to 7 cm not suitable for resection or liver transplantation. Treatment consisted of 2 sessions of drug-eluting bead-TACE within 1 month followed by immediate SBRT. SBRT delivered 35 to 50 Gy in 5 fractions. The primary endpoint was best objective response rate (ORR) by modified Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumours (mRECIST). Secondary endpoints were overall survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS), and toxic effects. RESULTS: From 2014 to 2020, 32 were enrolled in a single institution with median follow-up of 37 months. Thirty patients had at least 1 posttreatment scan to assess response. ORR in the target lesion was 91%: 63% complete response (CR; n = 20), 28% partial response (n = 9), and 3% progression of disease (n = 1). Median time to CR was 10.1 months. Median OS was not yet reached and median PFS was 35 months. Patients achieving CR had a trend toward improved PFS (P = .09). Toxic effects were low. CONCLUSIONS: This phase 2 trial showed very promising ORR when combining TACE + SBRT in large, unresectable HCC, which translates into excellent OS and PFS. These results provide the rationale for exploring this combination in larger phase 2 and 3 clinical trials and a space where SBRT might offer unique clinical advantage.",Buckstein M; Kim E; Özbek U; Tabrizian P; Gunasekaran G; Facciuto M; Rosenzweig K; Llovet JM; Schwartz M

Theoretically, a combination of tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) with ICIs may restore immunotherapy sensitivity. METHODS: In this phase 1b study, patients received AL2846, an antiangiogenic TKI with multiple targets (c-MET, VEGFR1, c-KIT, Axl, RET, KDR, and VEGFR3), in combination with an anti-PD-L1 antibody (TQB2450) until disease progression, intolerable toxicity, death, or discontinuation for any cause. The primary end points included overall response rate (ORR) and safety, with secondary end points encompassing progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), disease control rate (DCR), and duration of response. RESULTS: Between November 2021 and September 2022, 18 patients with ESCC and 15 patients with HCC, whose ORR was 11.1% (95% confidence interval [CI], 3.1%-32.8%) and 0%, respectively, were enrolled. Adverse events (AEs) of any grade and treatment-related AEs were documented in 32 patients (97.0%) and 31 patients (93.9%), respectively. Grade 3 or higher AEs were observed in 10 patients (30.3%), with vomiting (6.1%) and infectious pneumonia (9.1%) being the most prevalent. Median PFS and OS values were 3.22 months (95% CI, 1.35-5.68 months) and 5.98 months (95% CI, 3.71-8.87 months), respectively, in patients with ESCC, and 5.55 months (95% CI, 2.66 months to not evaluable [NE]) and 16.72 months (95% CI, 4.86 months to NE), respectively, in patients with HCC. The DCRs were 66.7% (95% CI, 43.75%-83.72%) in patients with ESCC and 73.3% (95% CI, 48.05%-89.10%) in patients with HCC.

91,Incremental high power radiofrequency ablation with multi-electrodes for small hepatocellular carcinoma: a prospective study.,10.1186/s12876-024-03358-w,"Radiofrequency ablation (RFA) offers a minimally invasive treatment for small hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), but it faces challenges such as high local recurrence rates. This prospective study, conducted from January 2020 to July 2022, evaluated a novel approach using a three-channel, dual radiofrequency (RF) generator with separable clustered electrodes to improve RFA's efficacy and safety. The study employed a high-power, gradual, stepwise RFA method on HCCs (≤ 4 cm), utilizing real-time ultrasound-computed tomography (CT)/magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) fusion imaging. Involving 110 participants with 116 HCCs, the study reported no major complications. Local tumor progression (LTP) and intrahepatic remote recurrence (IRR) rates were low, with promising cumulative incidences at 1, 2, and 3 years for LTP (0.9%, 3.6%, 7.0%) and IRR (13.9%, 20.5%, 31.4%). Recurrence-free survival (RFS) rates were similarly encouraging: LTP (99.1%, 96.4%, 93.0%) and IRR (86.1%, 79.5%, 68.6%). This innovative gradual, incremental high-power RFA technique, featuring a dual switching monopolar mode and three electrodes, represents an effective and safer management option for small HCCs.

92,Role of stereotactic body radiotherapy for inferior vena cava tumour thrombus in hepatocellular carcinoma.,10.1111/1754-9485.13527,"INTRODUCTION: To evaluate the role of stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients with inferior vena cava tumour thrombus (IVCTT) who are not suitable for other loco-regional therapies. METHODS: This is an observational retrospective study done between May 2020 and April 2022. The data of 17 patients who underwent SBRT were collected. Patients of Child-Pugh score (CPS) A5-B7 and along with a liver reserve of ≥700 cc were included. Local control (LC), overall survival (OS) and adverse events including hepatic decompensation were carefully recorded. RESULTS: In the cohort, the tumour thrombus was extended to the right atrium in nine (52.9%) patients, and regional nodal and lung were found in 60% and 31.4% of patients respectively. The median gross tumour volume (GTV) was 745 cc (107-1,650 cc). The median SBRT dose prescription was 35 Gy (25-45 Gy) in 5-10 fractions. At 6 months, LC and OS were 80% and 75% respectively. On multivariate analysis, an ALBI score >-2.36 was found to be the predictor for the poor OS. Post-SBRT, a change in CPs by 2 points was observed in one patient (5.9%) which was managed conservatively. Post-radiation, improvement in pain and discomfort was observed in 92.3% and 87% of patients, respectively and bone metastasis related pain was also resolved. CONCLUSION: Stereotactic body radiotherapy is a safe and feasible option for HCC patients with IVC and right atrium tumour thrombosis. It not only improves the quality of life but also results in good LC and OS with acceptable toxicity. SBRT should be considered in a multidisciplinary fashion for patients presenting with tumour thrombosis extending to IVC and the right atrium.",Sharma D; Thaper D; Kamal R; Yadav HP

MATERIALS AND METHODS: This single-center, prospective, phase II, randomized controlled, non-inferiority, double-blind trial will enroll 128 treatment-naïve patients with HCC (≤ 5 tumors, 1-5 cm in diameter) for conventional TACE. Participants will be randomly assigned (1:1) to either IDA-TACE or DOX-TACE, with stratification by Child-Pugh class. Superselective conventional TACE will be performed using cone-beam CT and small-bore microcatheters. Patient evaluations, including dynamic imaging and blood tests, will occur at 1, 3, and 6 months post-initial treatment. The primary outcome measure is the objective response rate (ORR) according to mRECIST at 6 months. Secondary outcomes include 3-month and 6-month tumor responses, time-to-progression, the incidence of treatment-related serious adverse events within 30 days, and the incidence and severity of any adverse events. STATISTICS: Non-inferiority will be claimed if the upper limit of a one-sided 97.5% confidence interval for the proportion difference (i.e., ""6-month ORR of DOX-TACE"" - ""6-month ORR of IDA-TACE"") falls below 0.15 in both intention-to-treat and per-protocol analyses. The proportion difference and its confidence interval will be calculated by the Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel method to obtain a weighted average of stratum-specific proportion differences. EXPECTED GAIN OF KNOWLEDGE: If IDA-TACE demonstrates outcomes comparable to DOX-TACE, this study could provide compelling evidence that various cytotoxic agents yield similar contributions in TACE, considering the minor role of chemotherapeutic agents in TACE.

94,Discussing the safety and effectiveness of transcatheter arterial embolization combined with intravenous chemotherapy in treating locally advanced breast cancer.,10.1038/s41598-024-56642-w,"To investigate the efficacy and safety of drug-eluting bead-transarterial chemoembolization (DEB-TACE) combined with systemic chemotherapy in HR+/Her2- locally advanced breast cancer (LABC) patients. A controlled study was conducted on LABC patients treated at Jianyang People's Hospital and the First Affiliated Hospital of Chengdu Medical College from December 2020 to June 2022. The patients were randomly divided into the experimental group and the control group. The experimental group received DEB-TACE combined with the TAC regimen (175 mg/m(2) paclitaxel-loaded albumin, 50 mg/m(2) Doxorubicin, and 500 mg/m(2) cyclophosphamide), while the control group received the TAC regimen intravenously. The therapeutic efficacy was evaluated using the mRECIST criteria. Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS 22.0 software, and baseline characteristics, overall response rate (ORR), pathological complete response (PCR), adverse reactions, and complications were compared between the two groups using paired t-test and chi-square test. A total of 60 patients were included, with 30 patients in the experimental group (50%) and 30 patients in the control group (50%). After the first treatment, the ORR was 90% in the experimental group and 60% in the control group (P < 0.05). The overall ORR was 100% in the experimental group and 83% in the control group (P < 0.05). PCR was achieved in 14 patients (47%) in the experimental group and 4 patients (13%) in the control group. The main adverse reactions in the experimental group were skin blistering, pigmentation, and pain. There was no statistically significant difference in vomiting and grade II or above bone marrow suppression between the two groups. No grade III or above adverse events occurred in either group. The comparison of tumor shrinkage between the two groups was P = 0.051, and axillary lymph node shrinkage was P < 0.05.

The incidence is increasing globally. In Latin America, there is no consistent data on the epidemiology of hepatocellular carcinoma. However, Brazil is considered a country with an intermediate incidence of this liver neoplasm. In the state of Ceará, situated in the northeast region of Brazil, there are no consistent clinical and epidemiologic data on the actual incidence and the treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma. The purpose of this article is to describe epidemiologic characteristics and treatment forms of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma who were treated in a Liver Transplant Center. A retrospective observational study was conducted using the database from the register of 299 patients with hepatocellular carcinoma between June 2004 and February 2022. Only patients born in Ceará were included. Therefore, most patients were eligible, based on the Milan Criteria, to undergo liver transplantation with a Model End Stage Liver Disease score of 12.48 ± 4.66 points, and the waiting list time was approximately 7 months with 8.7% hepatocellular carcinoma recurrence after liver transplant. A total of 38.5 % of cases were outside the Milan criteria at the time of cancer diagnosis, and transarterial chemoembolization was the main treatment choice. In conclusion, the diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma in Ceará mainly occurs in male patients with hepatitis C or alcoholism, with a mean age of 61.55 years and a previous diagnosis of liver disease. Liver transplantation was the best curative therapeutic form in patients with cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma in Ceará, where a significant number of patients were diagnosed with intermediate and advanced-stage hepatocellular carcinoma, so public health policies are important for the screening and monitoring of liver disease.",Costa PEG; Garcia JHP; Coelho GR; Barros MAP; Hyppolito EB; Pereira KB; Rocha TDDS; Costa GCG

98,Construction and validation of a nomogram for hepatocellular carcinoma patients based on HCC-GRIm score.,10.1007/s00432-023-05037-x,"PURPOSE: To construct a nomogram for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients base on HCC-GRIm score. METHODS: Clinical cases of HCC patients diagnosed at Hunan Integrated Traditional Chinese and Western Medicine Hospital were included, and these were randomly divided into the training cohort (n = 219) and the validation cohort (n = 94), and those patients were divided into low GRIm-Score group (scores 0, 1, and 2) and high GRIm-Score group (scores 3, 4, and 5). In the training cohort, independent risk factors were determined by Cox regression analysis, and a nomogram was constructed by independent risk factors. The efficiency and the clinical applicability of nomograms were evaluated using ROC curves, calibration plot, and the decision curve (DCA), and the patients were divided into high-risk, middle-risk, and low-risk groups according to total score of nomogram. RESULTS: Compared to low HCC-GRIm score group, high HCC-GRIm score group with BCLC stage is more advanced (P < 0.001), and fewer patients received TACE (P = 0.005) and surgical treatment (P = 0.001). There was higher rate of the presence of vascular invasion (P < 0.001) and distant metastasis (P < 0.001). Multivariate Cox regression analysis screened 4 independent risk factors to construct a nomogram of HCC patients, including HCC-GRIm score, BCLC stage, albumin-to-globulin ratio (AGR), and glutamyl trans-peptidase (GGT). The consistency index (C-index) of the nomogram of the training was 0.843 (0.832-0.854) and the validation was 0.870 (0.856-0.885). The time-dependent parameter showed the AUC values of the training cohort at 1, 3, and 5 years were 0.954 (95% CI 0.929-0.980), 0.952 (95% CI 0.919-0.985), and 925 (95% CI 0.871-0.979), while the AUC values of validation cohort at 1, 3, and 5 years were 0.974 (95% CI 0.950-0.998), 0.965 (95% CI 0.931-0.999), and 0.959 (95% CI 0.898-1.021). The calibration plot showed the nomogram fits well onto perfect curves, and the DCA curve showed the net benefit of the nomogram at a certain probability threshold is significantly higher than the net benefit of the BCLC stage at the same threshold probability. Finally, all patients were divided into high-risk, middle-risk, and low-risk groups based on the total score of nomogram, and it showed effectively to identify high-risk patients. CONCLUSION: The nomogram constructed by the independent risk factors can predict the prognosis of HCC patients, providing an effective tool with clinical workers to evaluate the prognosis and survival time of HCC patients. part of Springer Nature.",Yu X; Yang R; He Z; Li K; Zeng P
99,Efficacy of dexamethasone and N-acetylcysteine combination in preventing post-embolization syndrome after transarterial chemoembolization in hepatocellular carcinoma.,10.3748/wjg.v29.i5.890,"BACKGROUND: Conventional transarterial chemoembolization (cTACE) is the current standard treatment for intermediate-stage hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Post-embolization syndrome (PES) is complex clinical syndrome that presents as fever, abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting. Either dexamethasone (DEXA) or N-acetylcysteine (NAC) is used to prevent PES; however, the synergistic effect of their combined therapy for preventing PES and liver decompensation has not been determined. AIM: To evaluate the efficacy of DEXA and NAC combination in preventing PES and liver decompensation after cTACE. METHODS: Patients with Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer stage A or B HCC who were scheduled for TACE were prospectively enrolled. All patients were randomly stratified to receive NAC and DEXA or placebo. The dual therapy (NAC + DEXA) group received intravenous administration of 10 mg DEXA every 12 h, NAC 24 h prior to cTACE (150 mg/kg/h for 1 h followed by 12.5 mg/kg/h for 4 h), and a continuous infusion of 6.25 mg/h NAC plus 4 mg DEXA every 12 h for 48 h after cTACE. The placebo group received an infusion of 5% glucose solution until 48 h after procedure. PES was defined by South West Oncology Group toxicity code grading of more than 2 that was calculated using incidence of fever, nausea, vomiting, and pain. RESULTS: One-hundred patients were enrolled with 50 patients in each group. Incidence of PES was significantly lower in the NAC + DEXA group compared with in the placebo group (6% vs 80%; P < 0.001). Multivariate analysis showed that the dual treatment is a protective strategic therapy against PES development [odds ratio (OR) = 0.04; 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.01-0.20; P < 0.001). Seven (14%) patients in the placebo group, but none in the NAC + DEXA group, developed post-TACE liver decompensation. A dynamic change in Albumin-Bilirubin score of more than 0.5 point was found to be a risk factor for post-TACE liver decompensation (OR = 42.77; 95%CI: 1.01-1810; P = 0.049). CONCLUSION: Intravenous NAC + DEXA administration ameliorated the occurrence of PES event after cTACE in patients with intermediate-stage HCC. reserved.",Simasingha N; Tanasoontrarat W; Claimon T; Sethasine S
100,Interim efficacy and safety of PD-1 inhibitors in preventing recurrence of hepatocellular carcinoma after interventional therapy.,10.3389/fimmu.2022.1019772,"INTRODUCTION: Locoregional interventional therapy including transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (TACE) and ablation are the current standard of treatment for early-to-mid-stage hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). However, questions remain unanswered regarding the management of recurrence after locoregional treatment. PD-1 inhibitors can block inhibitory signals of T-cell activation and proliferation to reduce the recurrence. We conducted a single-arm phase 2 trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of PD-1 inhibitors following locoregional interventional therapy in HCC patients with high recurrence risk guided by our novel scoring system. METHODS: Patients enrolled initially treated by TACE combined with ablation, then willingly joined the experimental group. One month later, they received the anti-PD-1 adjuvant therapy (intravenous injection of 200 mg), which was repeated every 3 weeks for a total of 4 or 8 cycles. Within this same period, other patients were screened into the control group to match the experimental group by 1:1 based on the propensity score matching method (PSM). The primary endpoint was relapse-free survival (RFS). Secondary endpoints included overall survival (OS) recurrence modality, safety, and quality of life. RESULT: At the time of data cutoff, the median RFS of the control group was 7.0 months while the experimental group had not reached it. Moreover, the 1-year RFS rate was 73.3% in the experimental group and 46.7% in the control group, showing a significant difference (P =0.02). The rate of local tumor progression in the experimental group was clearly lower than that in the control group (P = 0.027). Benefits associated with anti-PD-1 adjuvant therapy were observed in patients with multiple tumors and tumor size ≤2cm. Univariate and multivariate analyses demonstrated that anti-PD-1 adjuvant therapy was an independent favorable prognostic factor for RFS in HCC patients. The most frequent AE observed in this study was RCCEP, and other AEs included diarrhea, hepatotoxicity, rash, pruritus, and fatigue. The incidence of GRADE ≥3 AE and withdrawal in this study was low with no deaths recorded. CONCLUSIONS: Interim analysis from the study suggest the addition of anti-PD-1 adjuvant therapy after TACE combined with ablation could significantly prolong RFS with controllable safety for early-to-mid-stage HCC patients with high recurrence risk.",Qiao W; Wang Q; Hu C; Zhang Y; Li J; Sun Y; Yuan C; Wang W; Liu B; Zhang Y
101,"Carvedilol to prevent decompensation of cirrhosis in patients with clinically significant portal hypertension stratified by liver stiffness: study protocol for a randomied, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicentre trial in China.",10.1136/bmjopen-2023-081623,"INTRODUCTION: Patients with clinically significant portal hypertension (CSPH) are recommended to be treated with non-selective beta-blockers (ie, carvedilol) to prevent the first hepatic decompensation event by the renewing Baveno VII consensus. CSPH is defined by hepatic venous pressure gradient (HVPG)≥10 mm Hg; however, the HVPG measurement is not widely adopted due to its invasiveness. Liver stiffness (LS)≥25 kPa can be used as a surrogate of HVPG≥10 mm Hg to rule in CSPH with 90% of the positive predicting value in majority aetiologies of patients. A compelling argument is existing for using LS≥25 kPa to diagnose CSPH and then to initiate carvedilol in patients with compensated cirrhosis, and about 5%-6% of patients under this diagnosis criteria may not be benefited from carvedilol and are at risk of lower heart rate and mean arterial pressure. Randomised controlled trial on the use of carvedilol to prevent liver decompensation in CSPH diagnosed by LS remains to elucidate. Therefore, we aimed to investigate if compensated cirrhosis patients with LS≥25 kPa may benefit from carvedilol therapy. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: This study is a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicentre trial. We will randomly assign 446 adult compensated cirrhosis patients with LS≥25 kPa and without any previous decompensated event and without high-risk gastro-oesophageal varices. Patients are randomly divided into two groups, with 223 subjects in group A and 223 subjects in group B. Group A is a carvedilol intervention group, while group B is a placebo group. All patients in both groups will receive aetiology therapies and are followed up at an interval of 6 months. The 3-year incidences of decompensated events of cirrhosis-related and liver-related death are the primary outcome. The secondary outcomes include development of each complication of portal hypertension individually (ascites, variceal bleeding or overt hepatic encephalopathy), development of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis and other bacterial infections, development of new varices, growth of small varices to large varices, delta changes in LS and spleen stiffness, change in hepatic dysfunction assessed by Child-Pugh and model for end-stage liver disease score, change in platelet count, development of hepatocellular carcinoma, development of portal vein thrombosis and adverse events with a 3-year follow-up. A predefined interim analysis will be performed to ensure that the calculation is reasonable. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The study protocol has been approved by the ethics committees of the Sixth People's Hospital of Shenyang (2023-05-003-01) and independent ethics committee for clinical research of Zhongda Hospital, affiliated to Southeast University (2023ZDSYLL433-P01).

102,Role of palliative SBRT in barcelona clinic liver cancer-stage C hepatocellular carcinoma patients.,10.1007/s00066-023-02065-x,"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the role of palliative stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) in Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer stage‑C (BCLC-C) hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients who are not suitable for other loco-regional therapies. MATERIALS AND METHODS: It is an observational retrospective study done between May 2020 and September 2021. The data were collected from 35 patients of advanced HCC who underwent SBRT. Patients of Child Pugh status (CPs) A5-B7 and with a liver reserve of ≥ 700cc were included. Local control (LC), overall survival (OS) and adverse events including decompensation were carefully recorded. RESULTS: In the cohort, Portal vein and IVC tumor thrombosis were present in 33 (94.3%) and 8 (22.85%) patients, respectively. Lung and nodal metastasis were found in 11 (31.4%) and 21 (60%) of patients, respectively. The median gross tumor volume (GTV) was 563cc (range 80-1925cc). The median SBRT dose prescription was 35 Gy (range 25-40 Gy) in 5-10 fractions. Post radiation therapy, there was improvement in pain and discomfort in 24 out of 29 (82.75%) and 18 out of 23 (78%) patients respectively. Also bone metastasis related pain was improved in all 3 (100%) patients. One year LC, and OS were 80% and 30% respectively. On multivariate analysis, the GTV volume > 750cc and PIVKA-II > 8000 mAU/ml remained the predictor factor for poor OS. Post SBRT, change in child-pugh score by 1 point was observed in 7 patients (20%) which was managed conservatively. CONCLUSION: SBRT is a safe and feasible option for BCLC‑C HCC. It not only improves the quality of life by symptom control but also results in good LC and OS with acceptable toxicity. SBRT should be considered in a multidisciplinary fashion for patients presenting with advanced HCCs.",Sharma D; Thaper D; Kamal R; Yadav HP
103,Multicenter evaluation of the safety and efficacy of selective internal radiation therapy with yttrium-90 resin microspheres in Taiwan: data from the RESIN registry.,10.1111/jgh.16556,"BACKGROUND AND AIM: The REgistry of Selective Internal radiation therapy in AsiaNs (RESIN) was a multicenter, single-arm, prospective, observational study of (90)Y resin microspheres in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) or metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) from Taiwan. RESIN is the first real-life clinical study of this therapy in an Asian cohort. Study objectives were to evaluate the safety and efficacy of (90)Y resin microspheres. METHODS: Adults with HCC or mCRC scheduled to receive SIRT with (90)Y resin microspheres were included. Primary endpoints were best overall response rate (ORR), adverse events, and changes from baseline in liver function. Secondary efficacy endpoints included overall survival (OS). RESULTS: Of 107 enrolled patients, 83 had HCC, and 24 had mCRC. ORR was 55.41% (HCC) and 33.33% (mCRC). Of 58 HCC patients with 6-month post-SIRT data, 13.79% (n = 8) had resection, transplantation, transarterial chemoembolization, or radiofrequency ablation as the result of down-staging or down-sizing of their lesions. One hundred and ten treatment emergent adverse events (TEAEs) were reported in 51 patients, and five serious adverse events (SAEs) were reported in five patients. The most frequent TEAEs were abdominal pain, nausea and decreased appetite (HCC), and abdominal pain, decreased appetite, fatigue, and vomiting (mCRC). Two deaths due to SAEs (probably related to SIRT) were reported, both in patients with extensive HCC, active hepatitis infection, and other comorbidities. Median OS was 24.07 (HCC) and 12.66 (mCRC) months. CONCLUSIONS: Safety and efficacy outcomes with the routine use of SIRT with (90)Y resin microspheres in Taiwan are consistent with published data.

104,Comparison of CalliSpheres(®) microspheres drug-eluting beads and conventional transarterial chemoembolization in hepatocellular carcinoma patients: a randomized controlled trial.,10.2478/raon-2023-0001,"BACKGROUND: This trial aimed to compare the outcomes of drug-eluting beads transarterial chemoembolization (DEB-TACE) with CalliSpheres(®) microspheres (CSM) and conventional transarterial chemoembolization cTACE in the treatment of patients with unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 90 patients were divided into DEB-TACE group (n = 45) and cTACE group (n = 45). The treatment response, overall survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS), and the safety were compared between the two groups. RESULTS: The objective response rate (ORR) in the DEB-TACE group was significantly higher than that in cTACE group at 1, 3, and 6 months of follow-up (P = 0.031, P = 0.003, P = 0.002). The complete response (CR) in DEB-TACE group was significantly higher than that in cTACE group at 3 months (P = 0.036). Survival analysis revealed that, DEB-TACE group had better survival benefits than cTACE group (median OS: 534 days vs. 367 days, P = 0.027; median PFS: 352 days vs. 278 days P = 0.004). The degree of liver function injury was more serious in DEB-TACE group at 1 week, but was similar between the two groups at 1 month. DEB-TACE with CSM caused a high incidence of fever and a severe abdominal pain (P = 0.031, P = 0.037). CONCLUSIONS: DEB-TACE with CSM showed better treatment response and survival benefits than cTACE group. Although a transient more severe liver damage, high incidence of fever and a severe abdominal pain occurred in the DEB-TACE group, it could be resolved through symptomatic treatment.

105,Radiomics analysis of ultrasound to predict recurrence of hepatocellular carcinoma after microwave ablation.,10.1080/02656736.2022.2062463,"OBJECTIVE: To develop and validate an ultrasonic radiomics model for predicting the recurrence and differentiation of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Convolutional neural network (CNN) ResNet 18 and Pyradiomics were used to analyze gray-scale-ultrasonic images to predict the prognosis and degree of differentiation of HCC. METHODS: This retrospective study enrolled 513 patients with HCC who underwent preoperative grayscale-ultrasonic imaging, and their clinical characteristics were observed. Patients were randomly divided into training (n = 413) and validation (n = 100) cohorts. CNN ResNet 18 and Pyradiomics were used to analyze ultrasonic images of HCC and peritumoral images to develop a prognostic and differentiation model. Clinical characteristics were integrated into the radiomics model and patients were stratified into high- and low-risk groups. The predictive effect was evaluated using the C-index and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve. RESULTS: The model combined with ResNet 18 and clinical characteristics achieved a good predictive ability. The C-indices of early recurrence (ER), late recurrence (LR), and recurrence-free survival (RFS) were 0.695 (0.561-0.789), 0.715 (0.623-0.800) and 0.721 (0.647-0.795), respectively, in the validation cohort, which was superior to the clinical model and ultrasonic semantic model. The model could stratify patients into high- and low-risk groups, which showed significant differences (p < 0.001) in ER, LR, and RFS. The area under the curve for predicting the degree of HCC differentiation was 0.855 and 0.709 in the training and validation cohorts, respectively. CONCLUSION: We developed and validated a radiomics model to predict HCC recurrence and HCC differentiation, which could also acquire pathological information in a noninvasive manner.KEY RESULTSA hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) prognostic prediction model was developed and validated by convolutional neural network (CNN) ResNet 18-based gray-scale ultrasound (US).A differentiation of HCC prediction model was developed for preoperative prediction avoiding invasive operation.Compared with Pyradiomics, CNN ResNet was more suitable for extracting information from US images.",Wu JP; Ding WZ; Wang YL; Liu S; Zhang XQ; Yang Q; Cai WJ; Yu XL; Liu FY; Kong D; Zhong H; Yu J; Liang P
106,Radiotherapy prior to or after transcatheter arterial chemoembolization for the treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma with portal vein tumor thrombus: a randomized controlled trial.,10.1007/s12072-022-10423-7,"INTRODUCTION: To compare survival outcomes of radiotherapy (RT) prior to transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (TACE) (RT + TACE) with TACE followed with RT (TACE + RT) in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and portal vein tumor thrombus (PVTT). METHODS: A randomized controlled study was conducted from August 2016 to December 2019 on patients with unresectable HCC and PVTT. The patients were randomly assigned to RT + TACE group or TACE + RT group in a 1:1 ratio. Evaluation of therapeutic effects on the primary tumor was based on the modified Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (mRECIST), while that on PVTT was based on the changing of Cheng's PVTT classification. The primary end-point was overall survival (OS). RESULTS: The 120 patients who entered this study were evenly assigned to two groups. In the intention-to-treat (ITT) population, the OS rates for RT + TACE group at 1, 2 and 3 years were 61.7%, 27.4% and 15.6%, compared with 45.0%, 16.1% and 4.7% in TACE + RT group. The median OS was increased in patients with RT + TACE compared with those who had TACE + RT with a marginally significance (15.4 versus 11.5 months, HR = 0.68, 95% CI 0.46-1.01, p = 0.054). The median progression-free survival (PFS) in RT + TACE group was 6.6 months versus 4.2 months in TACE + RT group (HR = 0.66, 95% CI 0.46-0.96, p = 0.030). The corresponding disease control rate (DCR) at 3 months was 86.7% versus 66.7% (p = 0.017) and 61.7% versus 46.7% (p = 0.099) at 6 months. In subgroup analyses, RT + TACE was associated with better OS (HR, 0.48; 95% CI 0.33-0.99, p = 0.048) and PFS (HR, 0.55; 95% CI 0.33-0.93, p = 0.026) versus TACE + RT among patients with type III/IV PVTT. There were 3 patients in RT + TACE group and 2 in TACE + RT group had adverse events ≥  grade 3. CONCLUSION: Applying RT prior to TACE provided better survival outcomes than TACE followed by RT for patients with HCC and PVTT, which may act as an optimized regional modality to further improve local control rates (Trial registration: ChiCTR ChiCTR2000033573.).",Guo L; Wei X; Feng S; Zhai J; Guo W; Shi J; Lau WY; Meng Y; Cheng S
107,Virtual clinical trials of anti-PD-1 and anti-CTLA-4 immunotherapy in advanced hepatocellular carcinoma using a quantitative systems pharmacology model.,10.1136/jitc-2022-005414,"BACKGROUND: Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the most common form of primary liver cancer and is the third-leading cause of cancer-related death worldwide. Most patients with HCC are diagnosed at an advanced stage, and the median survival for patients with advanced HCC treated with modern systemic therapy is less than 2 years. This leaves the advanced stage patients with limited treatment options. Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) targeting programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) or its ligand, are widely used in the treatment of HCC and are associated with durable responses in a subset of patients. ICIs targeting cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated protein 4 (CTLA-4) also have clinical activity in HCC. Combination therapy of nivolumab (anti-PD-1) and ipilimumab (anti-CTLA-4) is the first treatment option for HCC to be approved by Food and Drug Administration that targets more than one immune checkpoints. METHODS: In this study, we used the framework of quantitative systems pharmacology (QSP) to perform a virtual clinical trial for nivolumab and ipilimumab in HCC patients. Our model incorporates detailed biological mechanisms of interactions of immune cells and cancer cells leading to antitumor response. To conduct virtual clinical trial, we generate virtual patient from a cohort of 5,000 proposed patients by extending recent algorithms from literature. The model was calibrated using the data of the clinical trial CheckMate 040 (ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT01658878). RESULTS: Retrospective analyses were performed for different immune checkpoint therapies as performed in CheckMate 040. Using machine learning approach, we predict the importance of potential biomarkers for immune blockade therapies. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first QSP model for HCC with ICIs and the predictions are consistent with clinically observed outcomes. This study demonstrates that using a mechanistic understanding of the underlying pathophysiology, QSP models can facilitate patient selection and design clinical trials with improved success. commercial re-use.

108,Possible use of Digital Variance Angiography in Liver Transarterial Chemoembolization: A Retrospective Observational Study.,10.1007/s00270-023-03420-2,"PURPOSE: Digital variance angiography (DVA), a recently developed image processing technology, provided higher contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) and better image quality (IQ) during lower limb interventions than digital subtraction angiography (DSA). Our aim was to investigate whether this quality improvement can be observed also during liver transarterial chemoembolization (TACE). MATERIALS AND METHODS: We retrospectively compared the CNR and IQ parameters of DSA and DVA images from 25 patients (65% male, mean ± SD age: 67.5 ± 11.2 years) underwent TACE intervention at our institute. CNR was calculated on 50 images. IQ of every image set was evaluated by 5 experts using 4-grade Likert scales. Both single image evaluation and paired image comparison were performed in a blinded and randomized manner. The diagnostic value was evaluated based on the possibility to identify lesions and feeding arteries. RESULTS: DVA provided significantly higher CNR (mean CNR(DVA)/CNR(DSA) was 1.33). DVA images received significantly higher individual Likert score (mean ± SEM 3.34 ± 0,08 vs. 2.89 ± 0.11, Wilcoxon signed-rank p < 0.001) and proved to be superior also in paired comparisons (median comparison score 1.60 [IQR:2.40], one sample Wilcoxon p < 0.001 compared to equal quality level). DSA could not detect lesion and feeding artery in 28 and 36% of cases, and allowed clear detection only in 22% and 16%, respectively. In contrast, DVA failed only in 8 and 18% and clearly revealed lesions and feeding arteries in 32 and 26%, respectively. CONCLUSION: In our study, DVA provided higher quality images and better diagnostic insight than DSA; therefore, DVA could represent a useful tool in liver TACE interventions.

This phase 1b/2 study was designed to determine the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) of GT90001 plus nivolumab, and assess the safety and anti-tumor activity in patients with advanced HCC. METHODS: Patients with advanced HCC were recruited from 3 centers. Eligible patients in the dose de-escalation stage received the GT90001 on day 1 of a 14-day cycle in a rolling-six design with a fixed dose of nivolumab (3.0 mg/kg). Patients in dose-expansion stage received the RP2D of GT90001 plus nivolumab. Primary endpoint was safety. Key secondary endpoint was objective response rate (ORR) as per RECIST 1.1. RESULTS: Between July 9, 2019, and August 8, 2022, 20 patients were treated (6 in phase 1b; 14 in phase 2) and evaluable for analysis. In phase 1b, no dose-limiting toxicities were observed, and GT90001 7.0 mg/kg was confirmed as the RP2D. Common grade 3/4 adverse events (AEs) were platelet count decreased (15%). No deaths due to AEs were reported. Confirmed ORR and disease control rate were 30% (95% CI, 14.6%-51.9%) and 40% (95% CI, 21.9%-61.3%), respectively. Median duration of response was not calculated (95% CI, 7.39 months to not calculated). Median progression-free survival (PFS) was 2.81 months (95% CI, 1.71-9.33), with 6-month and 12-month PFS rates of 35% and 25%, respectively.

110,Analysis of phase III clinical trials in metastatic NSCLC to assess the correlation between QoL results and survival outcomes.,10.1186/s12916-023-02953-0,"BACKGROUND: In addition to improving survival outcomes, new oncology treatments should lead to amelioration of patients' quality of life (QoL). Herein, we examined whether QoL results correlated with PFS and OS outcomes in phase III randomized controlled trials (RCTs) investigating new systemic treatments in metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). METHODS: The systematic search of PubMed was conducted in October 2022. We identified 81 RCTs testing novel drugs in metastatic NSCLC and published in the English language in a PubMed-indexed journal between 2012 and 2021. Only trials reporting QoL results and at least one survival outcome between OS and PFS were selected. For each RCT, we assessed whether global QoL was ""superior,"" ""inferior,"" or with ""non-statistically significant difference"" in the experimental arm compared to the control arm. RESULTS: Experimental treatments led to superior QoL in 30 (37.0%) RCTs and inferior QoL in 3 (3.7%) RCTs. In the remaining 48 (59.3%) RCTs, a statistically significant difference between the experimental and control arms was not found. Of note, we found a statistically significant association between QoL and PFS improvements (X(2) = 3.93, p = 0.0473). In more detail, this association was not significant in trials testing immunotherapy or chemotherapy. On the contrary, in RCTs testing target therapies, QoL results positively correlated with PFS outcomes (p = 0.0196). This association was even stronger in the 32 trials testing EGFR or ALK inhibitors (p = 0.0077). On the other hand, QoL results did not positively correlate with OS outcomes (X(2) = 0.81, p = 0.368). Furthermore, we found that experimental treatments led to superior QoL in 27/57 (47.4%) trials with positive results and in 3/24 (12.5%) RCTs with negative results (p = 0.0028). Finally, we analyzed how QoL data were described in publications of RCTs in which QoL outcomes were not improved (n = 51). We found that a favorable description of QoL results was associated with sponsorship by industries (p = 0.0232). CONCLUSIONS: Our study reveals a positive association of QoL results with PFS outcomes in RCTs testing novel treatments in metastatic NSCLC. This association is particularly evident for target therapies. These findings further emphasize the relevance of an accurate assessment of QoL in RCTs in NSCLC.",Servetto A; Di Maio M; Salomone F; Napolitano F; Paratore C; Di Costanzo F; Viscardi G; Santaniello A; Formisano L; Bianco R

PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 87 patients aged 18-75 years with at least one measurable lesion per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (version 1.1) were included in the study. TACE was administered as needed, and camrelizumab and TKI medication were initiated within two weeks and one week after TACE, respectively. The primary endpoints were progression-free survival and objective response rate. RESULTS: The 87 patients in this trial were last evaluated on September 28, 2022, and 35.8% were still receiving treatment at the data cutoff. A total of 34 patients (39.1%) died, and the median OS was not reached. The median PFS was 10.5 months (95% CI: 7.8-13.1). The ORR rate was 71.3% (62/87), and the DCR rate was 89.7% (78/87) per mRECIST. According to RECIST version 1.1, the ORR rate was 35.6% (31/87), and the DCR rate was 87.4% (76/87). Ten patients (11.5%) successfully underwent conversion therapy and all achieved R0 resection. Two patients achieved a complete pathological response, four achieved a major pathological response, and four had a partial response. All treatment-related adverse events were tolerated. No serious adverse events were observed, and no treatment-related deaths occurred. CONCLUSIONS: TACE combined with TKI and camrelizumab was safe and effective in treating advanced HCC. Triple therapy may benefit patients with large tumor burden and portal vein cancer thrombus and is expected to provide a new treatment strategy for advanced HCC.

112,TACE with dicycloplatin in patients with unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma: a multicenter randomized phase II trial.,10.1007/s00330-022-08848-7,"OBJECTIVES: To investigate the efficacy and safety of dicycloplatin as chemotherapeutic regimen in transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (TACE) for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). METHODS: In this randomized, open-label, phase II trial, patients with unresectable HCC who were TACE treatment-naïve or experienced recurrence after surgical resection or ablation were enrolled at 7 centers in China from March 2019 to November 2019. Participants were randomly assigned (1:1:1) to receive TACE with chemotherapeutic regimen of dicycloplatin alone (group A1), dicycloplatin plus epirubicin (group A2), or epirubicin alone (group B). The primary endpoint was objective response rate (ORR). The secondary endpoints included disease control rate (DCR), duration of response (DOR), progression-free survival (PFS), and safety. RESULTS: The ORR at 6 months in group A1 (n = 22) was significantly better than that in group B (p = 0.093; 90% confidence interval [CI], 1.03-9.45). The DCR in group A1 was significantly higher than that in group B (p = 0.045; 90% CI, 1.29-12.88). There was no significant difference in DOR among the groups (p = 0.271). The median PFS were 6.00 and 3.05 months in groups A2 (n = 25) and B (n = 24), respectively (p = 0.061). Grade 3 or worse adverse events were similar among groups in the safety population (p = 0.173). CONCLUSION: TACE with dicycloplatin was comparably safe and well tolerable as epirubicin alone in patients with unresectable HCC. Compared with epirubicin alone, significant improvement in ORR and DCR when dicycloplatin was applied, as well as prolonged PFS when dicycloplatin plus epirubicin was applied, was generated. KEY POINTS: • To our knowledge, this is the first multicenter randomized trial to assess the efficacy and safety of TACE with dicycloplatin in patients with unresectable HCC. • This phase II trial showed that TACE with dicycloplatin alone or plus epirubicin was comparably safe and well tolerable as epirubicin alone. • Significant improvements in ORR, DCR when dicycloplatin was applied, and prolonged PFS when dicycloplatin plus epirubicin was applied were recorded compared with epirubicin alone.",Zhu HD; Li X; Ji JS; Huang M; Shao GL; Lu J; Zhao XY; Li HL; Yang ZQ; Tu JF; Zhou JM; Zeng CH; Teng GJ
113,Efficacy of CalliSpheres(®) drug-loaded microspheres combined with doxorubicin in hepatocellular carcinoma.,10.1080/00365521.2024.2390025,"OBJECTIVE: This study compared the efficacy and safety of the transarterial chemoembolization with CalliSpheres(®) drug-eluting beads loading with doxorubicin (DEB-TACE) versus conventional lipiodol (cTACE) in patients with unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). METHODS: A randomized controlled trial (RCT) was conducted with 144 patients, who were randomly assigned to receive either DEB-TACE with doxorubicin-loaded CalliSpheres(®) microspheres or cTACE with doxorubicin-lipiodol emulsion. Patients were followed up for 12 months, with assessments at 3 and 12 months posttreatment. The primary endpoint was the clinical response rate (CR), and the secondary endpoints were the overall survival (OS), the progression-free survival (PFS), and the safety profile of the two treatments. RESULTS: The results showed that DEB-TACE was superior to cTACE in terms of CR (50.0% vs 30.6% at 3 months, p = 0.03; 43.1% vs 25.0% at 12 months, p = 0.04), OS (18.2 months vs 14.6 months, p < 0.05), and PFS (7.4 months vs 4.8 months, p < 0.05), and that the safety profile of the two treatments was similar (p > 0.05 for all comparisons). However, the efficacy of DEB-TACE and cTACE varied according to the tumor morphology. DEB-TACE showed better CR rates in patients with nodular tumors, while no significant difference in CR between the two groups in patients with infiltrative tumors. CONCLUSION: DEB-TACE showed superior efficacy to cTACE in terms of CR, OS, and PFS, particularly in patients with nodular tumors, while maintaining a similar safety profile. These findings suggest that tumor morphology could inform treatment decisions for TACE in HCC patients.",Jin B; Gu Y; Xi S; Liu X; Wu X; Wang X; Li G
114,Machine Learning-Based Development of Nomogram for Hepatocellular Carcinoma to Predict Acute Liver Function Deterioration After Drug-Eluting Beads Transarterial Chemoembolization.,10.1016/j.acra.2023.05.014,"RATIONALE AND OBJECTIVES: Acute liver function deterioration (ALFD) following drug-eluting beads transarterial chemotherapy embolism (DEB-TACE) was considered a risk factor for prognosis in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). In this study, we aimed to develop and validate a nomogram for the prediction of ALFD after DEB-TACE. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 288 patients with HCC from a single center were randomly divided into a training dataset (n = 201) and a validation dataset (n = 87). The univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were performed to determine risk factors for ALFD. The least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) was applied to identify the key risk factors and fit a model. The performance, calibration, and clinical utility of the predictive nomogram were assessed using receiver operating characteristic curves, calibration curves, and decision curve analysis (DCA). RESULTS: LASSO regression analysis determined six risk factors with fibrosis index based on four factors (FIB-4) as the independent factor for the occurrence of ALFD after DEB-TACE. Gamma-glutamyltransferase, FIB-4, tumor extent, and portal vein invasion were integrated into the nomogram. In both the training and validation cohorts, the nomogram demonstrated promising discrimination with AUC of 0.762 and 0.878, respectively. The calibration curves and DCA revealed good calibration and clinical utility of the predictive nomogram. CONCLUSION: The nomogram-based risk of ALFD stratification may improve clinical decision-making and surveillance protocols for patients with a high risk of ALFD after DEB-TACE. Elsevier Inc.

115,"Association between gene expression signatures and clinical outcomes of pembrolizumab versus paclitaxel in advanced gastric cancer: exploratory analysis from the randomized, controlled, phase III KEYNOTE-061 trial.",10.1136/jitc-2023-006920,"BACKGROUND: In the randomized, controlled, phase III KEYNOTE-061 trial, second-line pembrolizumab did not significantly prolong overall survival (OS) versus paclitaxel in patients with PD-L1-positive (combined positive score ≥1) advanced gastric/gastroesophageal junction (G/GEJ) cancer but did elicit a longer duration of response and offered a favorable safety profile. This prespecified exploratory analysis was conducted to evaluate associations between tumor gene expression signatures and clinical outcomes in the phase III KEYNOTE-061 trial. METHODS: Using RNA sequencing data obtained from formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded baseline tumor tissue samples, we evaluated the 18-gene T-cell-inflamed gene expression profile (Tcell(inf)GEP) and 10 non-Tcell(inf)GEP signatures (angiogenesis, glycolysis, granulocytic myeloid-derived suppressor cell (gMDSC), hypoxia, monocytic MDSC (mMDSC), MYC, proliferation, RAS, stroma/epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition/transforming growth factor-β, WNT). The association between each signature on a continuous scale and outcomes was analyzed using logistic (objective response rate (ORR)) and Cox proportional hazards regression (progression-free survival (PFS) and OS). One-sided (pembrolizumab) and two-sided (paclitaxel) p values were calculated for Tcell(inf)GEP (prespecified α=0.05) and the 10 non-Tcell(inf)GEP signatures (multiplicity-adjusted; prespecified α=0.10). RESULTS: RNA sequencing data were available for 137 patients in each treatment group. Tcell(inf)GEP was positively associated with ORR (p=0.041) and PFS (p=0.026) for pembrolizumab but not paclitaxel (p>0.05). The Tcell(inf)GEP-adjusted mMDSC signature was negatively associated with ORR (p=0.077), PFS (p=0.057), and OS (p=0.033) for pembrolizumab, while the Tcell(inf)GEP-adjusted glycolysis (p=0.018), MYC (p=0.057), and proliferation (p=0.002) signatures were negatively associated with OS for paclitaxel. CONCLUSIONS: This exploratory analysis of tumor Tcell(inf)GEP showed associations with ORR and PFS for pembrolizumab but not for paclitaxel. Tcell(inf)GEP-adjusted mMDSC signature was negatively associated with ORR, PFS, and OS for pembrolizumab but not paclitaxel. These data suggest myeloid-driven suppression may play a role in resistance to PD-1 inhibition in G/GEJ cancer and support a strategy of considering immunotherapy combinations which target this myeloid axis.

116,Priming of Sorafenib Prior to Radiofrequency Ablation Does Not Increase Treatment Effect in Hepatocellular Carcinoma.,10.1007/s10620-021-07156-2,"BACKGROUND: Preclinical studies have shown that modulation of the tumor microvasculature with anti-angiogenic agents decreases tumor perfusion and may increase the efficacy of radiofrequency ablation (RFA) in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Retrospective studies suggest that sorafenib given prior to RFA promotes an increase in the ablation zone, but prospective randomized data are lacking. AIMS: We conducted a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase II trial to evaluate the efficacy of a short-course of sorafenib prior to RFA for HCC tumors sized 3.5-7 cm (NCT00813293). METHODS: Treatment consisted of sorafenib 400 mg twice daily for 10 days or matching placebo, followed by RFA on day 10. The primary objectives were to assess if priming with sorafenib increased the volume and diameter of the RFA coagulation zone and to evaluate its impact on RFA thermal parameters. Secondary objectives included feasibility, safety and to explore the relationship between tumor blood flow on MRI and RFA effectiveness. RESULTS: Twenty patients were randomized 1:1. Priming with sorafenib did not increase the size of ablation zone achieved with RFA and did not promote significant changes in thermal parameters, although it significantly decreased blood perfusion to the tumor by 27.9% (p = 0.01) as analyzed by DCE-MRI. No subject discontinued treatment owing to adverse events and no grade 4 toxicity was observed. CONCLUSION: Priming of sorafenib did not enhance the effect of RFA in intermediate sized HCC. Future studies should investigate whether longer duration of treatment or a different antiangiogenic strategy in the post-procedure setting would be more effective in impairing tumor perfusion and increasing RFA efficacy.

117,Phase I Dose-Escalation Study of Tirapazamine Chemoembolization for Unresectable Early- and Intermediate-Stage Hepatocellular Carcinoma.,10.1016/j.jvir.2022.04.031,"PURPOSE: To investigate the safety of replacing doxorubicin with tirapazamine in conventional transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) in an Asian population with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), and to determine the optimal tirapazamine dose for phase II studies. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This was a phase I, 3 + 3 dose-escalation study for patients with unresectable early- and intermediate-stage HCC who received 5, 10, or 20 mg/m(2) of intra-arterial (IA) tirapazamine followed by ethiodized oil/gelatin sponge-based embolization. Key eligibilities included HCCs no more than 10 cm in diameter, prior embolization allowed, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0 or 1, Child-Pugh score of 5-7, and platelet count of ≥60,000 μL. Dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) was defined as any grade 3 nonhematological or grade 4 hematological toxicity, with the exception of transient elevation of aminotransferase levels after the procedure. RESULTS: Seventeen patients were enrolled, 59% of whom had progression from a prior HCC therapy and 35% of whom had progression or recurrence after TACE. All patients tolerated the tirapazamine TACE well without any DLT or serious adverse event. Using the modified Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors, the complete response (CR) rate was 47%, and the CR + partial response rate was 65%. The median duration of response was not reached. The median time to progression was 12.6 months (95% confidence interval, 5.1-not reached). The median overall survival was 29.3 months. The selected phase II dose was set at a fixed dose of 35 mg of IA tirapazamine. CONCLUSIONS: IA tirapazamine with transarterial embolization was well tolerated and showed promising efficacy signals in intermediate-stage HCC, justifying pursuit of a phase II study.",Liu CH; Peng CM; Hwang JI; Liang PC; Chen PJ; Abi-Jaoudeh N; Giiang LH; Tyan YS

MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this prospective, observational study, 262 adult participants with HCC were divided into TACE+ (n = 93, 35%) or T-N (n = 169, 65%) groups, included from 36 centers in the United States. Overall survival (OS) was assessed using Kaplan-Meier analysis from the date of TARE. Best response at 6 months was evaluated using modified Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors. Six-month toxicities were reported using Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, version 5. RESULTS: Median OS for patients in the TACE+ and T-N groups was 22.3 months (95% CI: 17.2 to not reachable) and 21.5 months (95% confidence interval [CI]: 14.9-29.9), respectively (P = .6). Imaging at 6 months ± 2 weeks was available in 156 of 262 (60%) participants. Partial or complete response was seen in 27 of 55 patients (49%) in the TACE+ group and 65 of 101 patients (64%) in the T-N group (P = .2). Six-month toxicities were available in 69 of 93 patients (74%) in the TACE+ group and 135 of 167 patients (81%) in the T-N group. Attributable Grade 3 or greater liver function toxicities were similar between the study groups (all P > .05). CONCLUSIONS: OS and imaging response at 6 months in the TACE+ group was similar to that in the T-N group with similar toxicities.

METHODS: A multicenter, randomized controlled trial was conducted in patients with high-risk recurrence factors after curative resection of HCC from 9 medical centers between July 2014 and July 2018. Totally 249 patients were randomly assigned to TACE with or without Cidan Capsule administration groups by stratified block in a 1:1 ratio. Postoperative adjuvant TACE was given 4-5 weeks after hepatic resection in both groups. Additionally, 125 patients in the TACE plus Cidan group were administrated Cidan Capsule (0.27 g/capsule, 5 capsules every time, 4 times a day) for 6 months with a 24-month follow-up. Primary endpoints included disease-free survival (DFS) and tumor recurrence rate (TRR). Secondary endpoint was overall survival (OS). Any drug-related adverse events (AEs) were observed and recorded. RESULTS: As the data cutoff in July 9th, 2018, the median DFS was not reached in the TACE plus Cidan group and 234.0 days in the TACE group (hazard ratio, 0.420, 95% confidence interval, 0.290-0.608; P<0.01). The 1- and 2-year TRR in the TACE plus Cidan and TACE groups were 31.5%, 37.1%, and 60.8%, 63.4%, respectively (P<0.01). Median OS was not reached in both groups. The 1- and 2-year OS rates in TACE plus Cidan and TACE groups were 98.4%, 98.4%, and 89.5%, 87.9%, respectively (P<0.05). The most common grade 3-4 AEs included fatigue, abdominal pain, lumbar pain, and nausea. One serious AE was reported in 1 patient in the TACE plus Cidan group, the death was due to retroperitoneal mass hemorrhage and hemorrhagic shock, and was not related to study drug. CONCLUSIONS: Cidan Capsule in combination with TACE can reduce the incidence of early recurrence in HCC patients at high-risk of recurrence after radical hepatectomy and may be an appropriate option in postoperative anti-recurrence treatment.

121,Combination transarterial chemoembolization and microwave ablation vs. microwave ablation monotherapy for hepatocellular carcinomas greater than 3 cm: a comparative study.,10.4274/dir.2023.232159,"PURPOSE: To evaluate the efficacy of combination therapy using transarterial chemoembolization with microwave ablation (MWA) therapy vs. MWA monotherapy for hepatocellular carcinomas (HCCs) >3 cm in size. METHODS: This two-arm retrospective observational study included patients with HCCs >3 cm who underwent either combination therapy (29 patients) or MWA monotherapy (35 patients) between 2014 and 2020. The treatment outcomes related to primary treatment efficacy, local tumor progression (LTP), tumor control rate, and overall survival were compared between each cohort. RESULTS: The technical success and primary efficacy were 96.56% and 100.00% in the combination therapy cohort, and 91.42% and 100.00% in the MWA cohort, respectively, over a mean follow-up period of 27.6 months. The 1- and 3-year rates of LTP-free survival were 78.57% and 69.56% in the combination therapy cohort, vs. 72.45% and 35.44% in the MWA cohort, respectively (P = 0.001). The overall progression-free survival was longer in the combination therapy cohort compared with the MWA cohort (median: 56.0 vs. 13.0 months; P = 0.017). With the incorporation of additional locoregional therapy, the overall survival rates were not significantly different, with 1- and 3-year overall survival rates of 100.00% and 88.71% in the combination therapy cohort and rates of 90.15% and 82.76% in the MWA cohort, respectively (P = 0.235). CONCLUSION: The combination therapy provided significantly longer upfront LTP-free survival in HCCs >3 cm when compared with the MWA treatment alone, albeit with similar local tumor control and overall survival rates when accounting for additional locoregional therapies.",Chiang J; Rajendran PS; Hao F; Sayre J; Raman SS; Lu DSK; McWilliams JP
122,Short-term efficacy assessment of transarterial chemoembolization combined with radioactive iodine therapy in primary hepatocellular carcinoma.,10.4240/wjgs.v15.i1.105,"BACKGROUND: Transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) is an effective treatment for primary hepatocellular carcinoma (PHC). Radioactive iodine therapy has been used in the treatment of advanced PHC, especially in patients with portal vein tumor thrombosis. However, data on the therapeutic effect of TACE combined with radioactive iodine therapy in PHC are scarce. AIM: To investigate the clinical efficacy of TACE combined with radioactive iodine implantation therapy in advanced PHC via perfusion computed tomography (CT). METHODS: For this study, 98 advanced PHC patients were recruited and divided randomly into the study and control groups. Patients in the study group were treated with TACE combined radioactive iodine implantation therapy. Patients in the control group were treated with only TACE. The tumor lesion length, clinical effect, serum alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) and CT perfusion parameters were compared before and after therapy, and statistical analysis was performed. RESULTS: There was no significant difference in tumor length and serum AFP between the study and control groups (P > 0.05) before treatment. However, the tumor length and serum AFP in the study group were lower than those in the control group 1 mo and 3 mo after therapy. After 3 mo of treatment, the complete and partial remission rate of the study group was 93.88%, which was significantly higher than the control group (77.55%) (P < 0.05). Before treatment, there were no significant differences between the two groups on the perfusion CT variables, including the lesion blood volume, permeability surface, blood flow, hepatic artery flow and mean transit time (P > 0.05). After 3 mo of treatment, all perfusion CT variables were lower in the study group compared to the control group (P < 0.05). The survival time of patients in the study group was 22 mo compared to 18 mo in the control group, which was significantly different [log rank (Mantel-Cox) = 4.318, P = 0.038]. CONCLUSION: TACE combined with radioactive iodine implantation in the treatment of advanced PHC can inhibit the formation of blood vessels in tumor tissue and reduce the perfusion level of tumor lesions, thereby improving the clinical efficacy and prolonging the survival time of patients. reserved.",Wang L; Huang K; Zhang Y; Wu YF; Yue ZD; Fan ZH; Liu FQ; Li YW; Dong J
123,Transcatheter arterial chemoembolization using CalliSpheres beads loaded with arsenic trioxide for unresectable large or huge hepatocellular carcinoma: a prospective study.,10.1007/s00330-023-10097-1,"OBJECTIVES: To determine the safety and efficacy of transcatheter arterial chemoembolization with CalliSpheres® beads loaded with arsenic trioxide (CBATO-TACE) in the first-line treatment of patients with large (5 cm ≤ maximum diameter < 10 cm) or huge (maximum diameter ≥ 10 cm) hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). METHODS: Patients were randomly allocated to the CBATO-TACE group and the conventional transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (cTACE) group. The primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS). The secondary endpoint was overall survival (OS), treatment response, and treatment-related adverse events (TRAEs). The extrahepatic collateral arteries, liver function, and liver fibrosis after the first TACE were also evaluated. RESULTS: From September 2018 to September 2020, a total of 207 patients who underwent TACE were consecutively enrolled in this study. The median PFS was 9.5 months (range: 8.0 - 11.0) in the CBATO group, which was significantly longer than that in the cTACE group (6.0 months, range: 4.0-6.0) (p < 0.0001). Patients in the CBATO group had a median OS of 22 months (range: 20.0 - 27.0) compared with 16 months (range: 15.0 - 20.0) in the cTACE group (p = 0.0084). The most common TRAEs were fever (p = 0.043), and nausea and vomiting (p = 0.002), which were more observed in the cTACE group. In addition, the progressive disease time, pulmonary metastasis rate (p = 0.01), the mean number of extrahepatic collateral arteries (p = 0.01), and average number of TACE sessions (p = 0.025) were significantly decreased in the CBATO group. CONCLUSIONS: CBATO-TACE achieved better therapeutic outcomes and similar safety profile compared to cTACE in large or huge HCC patients. Furthermore, CBATO-TACE was able to reduce extrahepatic collateral arteries production and extrahepatic lung metastasis. CLINICAL RELEVANCE STATEMENT: Our study showed that CalliSpheres® beads loaded with arsenic trioxide (CBATO-TACE) were effective and safe for the treatment of large and giant HCC. In addition, CBATO-TACE can reduce lateral hepatic branch artery formation and extrahepatic pulmonary metastasis, which provides a new treatment approach for unresectable HCC. KEY POINTS: • We compare long-term efficacy and safety of transcatheter arterial chemoembolization with CalliSpheres® beads loaded with arsenic trioxide (CBATO-TACE) and conventional transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (cTACE) in patients with large (5 cm ≤ maximum diameter < 10 cm) or huge HCC (maximum diameter ≥ 10 cm). • Compared with cTACE, CBATO-TACE significantly improved therapeutic outcomes, overall survival, and progression-free survival in patients with large or huge HCC. The safety assessment suggested that CBATO-TACE is a safe treatment that improves the quality of life and has good treatment adherence.",Duan X; Li H; Chen P; Sun T; Kuang D; Lu H; Qiao B; Fan Z; Ren Z; Han X
124,Carvedilol Plus NUC for Patients With HBV-Compensated Cirrhosis Under Virological Suppression: A Randomized Open-Label Trial.,10.14309/ajg.0000000000002569,"INTRODUCTION: Portal hypertension progression can be relieved after controlling the etiology of liver cirrhosis. Whether beta-blockers could additionally enhance the effects during treatment, particularly for small esophageal varices (EV), was unclear. This study aims to assess the efficacy of add-on carvedilol to delay EV progression during anti-hepatitis B virus (HBV) treatment in HBV-related cirrhosis. METHODS: This randomized controlled trial enrolled patients with virologically suppressed HBV-compensated cirrhosis and small/medium EV. The participants were randomly assigned to receive nucleos(t)ide analog (NUC) or carvedilol 12.5 mg plus NUC (1:1 allocation ratio). The primary end point was the progression rate of EV at 2 years of follow-up. RESULTS: A total of 238 patients (small EV, 77.3%) were randomized into 119 NUC and 119 carvedilol plus NUC (carvedilol [CARV] combination group). Among them, 205 patients (86.1%) completed paired endoscopies. EV progression rate was 15.5% (16/103) in the NUC group and 12.7% (13/102) in the CARV combination group (relative risk = 0.79, 95% confidence interval 0.36-1.75, P = 0.567). Subgroup analysis on medium EV showed the CARV combination group had a more favorable effect in promoting EV regression (43.5% vs 13.1%, P = 0.022) than NUC alone, but not in small cases ( P = 0.534). The incidence of liver-related events (decompensation, hepatocellular carcinoma, or death/liver transplantation) within 2 years was similar between the 2 groups (11.2% vs 10.4%, P = 0.881). DISCUSSION: The overall results did not show statistically significant differences between the added carvedilol strategy and NUC monotherapy in preventing EV progression in patients with virologically suppressed HBV-compensated cirrhosis. However, the carvedilol-added approach might offer improved outcomes specifically for patients with medium EV (NCT03736265).",Wang B; Zhou J; Wu X; Sun Y; Li L; Li P; Li M; Jiang W; Xu M; Feng B; Xu X; Cheng J; Xie W; Han T; Wang X; Li H; Piao H; Zhao X; Chen S; Meng T; Guan Q; Meng F; Kong Y; Ou X; Jia J; You H

The combination of lenvatinib (LEN) and transcatheter arterial chemoembolisation (TACE), termed LEN-TACE sequential therapy, has shown a high response rate and survival benefit in patients with intermediate-stage HCC. This trial aims to evaluate the efficacy and safety of LEN-TACE sequential therapy and the feasibility of surgical resection for intermediate-stage HCC beyond the Up-to-7 criteria. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: This is a multicentre, single-arm, prospective clinical trial. Thirty patients with intermediate-stage HCC beyond the Up-to-7 criteria will be enrolled. Patients eligible for this study will undergo LEN-TACE sequential therapy in which LEN is administered for 4 weeks, followed by TACE, and then further LEN for another 4 weeks. Patients will be assessed for efficacy of LEN-TACE sequential therapy and resectability, and surgical resection will be performed if the HCC is considered radically resectable. The primary outcome of this study is the resection rate after LEN-TACE sequential therapy. The secondary outcomes are the objective response rate of LEN-TACE sequential therapy, safety, curative resection rate, overall survival and recurrence-free survival.

126,Identifying optimal candidates for post-TIPS patients with HCC undergoing TACE: a multicenter observational study.,10.1007/s00330-022-09249-6,"OBJECTIVE: To develop a prognostic model for post-transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) beyond the Milan criteria treated by transarterial chemoembolization (TACE). DESIGN: Between January 2013 and January 2020, 512 patients with HCC beyond the Milan criteria who underwent TACE after TIPS were retrospectively recruited from 15 tertiary centers. Patients were randomly sorted into a training set (n = 382) and a validation set (n = 130). Medical data and overall survival were assessed. A prediction model was developed using multivariate Cox regression analyses. Predictive performance and discrimination were evaluated and compared with other prognostic models. RESULTS: Vascular invasion, log(10)(AFP), 1/creatinine, extrahepatic spread, and log(10)(ALT) were the most significant prognostic factors of survival. These five parameters were included in a new VACEA score. This score was able to stratify patients in the training set into four distinct risk grades whose median overall survival were 25.2, 15.1, 8.9, and 6.2 months, respectively. The 6-month, 1-year, 2-year, and 3-year AUROC values and C-index of the VACEA model were 0.819, 0.806, 0.779, 0.825, and 0.735, respectively, and higher than those of other seven currently available models in both the training and validation sets, as well as in different subgroups. CONCLUSION: The VACEA score could stratify post-TIPS patients with HCC beyond the Milan criteria treated by TACE and help to identify candidates who benefit from this treatment. KEY POINTS: • Vascular invasion, AFP, creatinine, extrahepatic spread, and ALT were independent significant prognostic factors of survival for HCC patients who underwent TACE after TIPS. • Our new model, named VACEA score, can accurately predict prognosis at the individual level and stratify patients into four distinct risk grades. • The VACEA model showed better prognostic discrimination and calibration than other current TACE-/TIPS-specific models Graphical abstract.",Fan W; Zhu B; Yue S; Zheng X; Yuan G; Yu L; Huang W; Huang S; Wei W; Li F; Huang Z; Tang R; Fan H; Li Z; Qiao L; Huang F; Cheng Y; Zhang Y; Wu Y; Zou X; Xue M; Wang H; Li J

128,Cost-effectiveness of radiofrequency ablation versus percutaneous ethanol injection for early hepatocellular carcinoma in a resource-poor setting: a randomized trial.,10.31744/einstein_journal/2024GS0683,"OBJECTIVE: This study assessed the cost-effectiveness of radiofrequency ablation compared with percutaneous ethanol injection in patients with early hepatocellular carcinoma in relation to the objective response rate and costs related to the procedure. METHODS: This was a prospective single-center randomized trial. The primary outcome was cost-effectiveness. Secondary outcomes were the complete response rate according to the modified response evaluation criteria in solid tumors 60 days after randomization and the complication rate within 180 60 days. RESULTS: Fifty patients were placed into the following groups: percutaneous ethanol injection (n=23) and radiofrequency ablation (n=27). Fifty-four nodules were randomized (mean follow-up: 205.37 days). The estimated mean hospital cost was US$ 1854.11 and US$ 2770.96 for the Radiofrequency Ablation and Percutaneous Ethanol Injection Groups, respectively. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was US$ -2674.59, which is advantageous for radiofrequency ablation. After 60 d, 28 of 29 nodules in the Radiofrequency Ablation Group achieved complete response versus 12 of 22 in the Percutaneous Ethanol Injection Group (RD, 42.01 [95%CI= 20.55-63.24]; p<0.001). Only four early complications were observed among patients treated by percutaneous ethanol injection (p<0.05). Late complications occurred in two and one patient(s) in the Radiofrequency Ablation and Percutaneous Ethanol Injection Groups (p>0.05), respectively. CONCLUSION: Radiofrequency ablation was more cost-effective and achieved higher complete response and lower complication rates than the Percutaneous Ethanol Injection Group within this cohort.

130,"VB-111 (ofranergene obadenovec) in combination with nivolumab in patients with microsatellite stable colorectal liver metastases: a single center, single arm, phase II trial.",10.1136/jitc-2023-008079,"BACKGROUND: Microsatellite stable colorectal liver metastases (MSS CLM) maintain an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME). Historically, immune-based approaches have been ineffective. VB-111 (ofranergene obadenovec) is a genetically-modified adenoviral vector targeting the TME; its unique dual mechanism induces an immune response and disrupts neovascularization. Checkpoint inhibition may synergize the immune response induced by viral-mediated anti-angiogenic gene therapy. We aimed to examine the safety and antitumor activity of VB-111 and nivolumab in patients with refractory MSS CLM and to characterize immunological treatment-response. METHODS: This was a phase II study of adult patients with histologically-confirmed MSS CLM who progressed on prior therapy. A priming dose of VB-111 1×10(13) viral particles was given intravenously 2 weeks prior to starting biweekly nivolumab 240 mg and continued every 6 weeks. The combination continued until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. The primary objectives were overall response rate and safety/tolerability. Secondary objectives included median overall survival and progression-free survival. Correlative studies were performed on paired tumor biopsies and blood. RESULTS: Between August 2020 and December 2021, 14 patients were enrolled with median age 50.5 years (40-75), and 14% were women. Median follow-up was 5.5 months. Of the 10 evaluable patients, the combination of VB-111 and nivolumab failed to demonstrate radiographic responses; at best, 2 patients had stable disease. Median overall survival was 5.5 months (95% CI: 2.3 to 10.8), and median progression-free survival was 1.8 months (95% CI: 1.4 to 1.9). The most common grade 3-4 treatment-related adverse events were fever/chills, influenza-like symptoms, and lymphopenia. No treatment-related deaths were reported. Qualitative analysis of immunohistochemical staining of paired tumor biopsies did not demonstrate significant immune infiltration after treatment, except for one patient who had exceptional survival (26.0 months). Immune analysis of peripheral blood mononuclear cells showed an increase of PD-1(high)Ki67(high)CD8(+) T cells and HLA-DR(high) T cells after VB-111 priming dose. Plasma cytokines interleukin-10 and tumor necrosis factor-α increased after treatment with both drugs. CONCLUSION: In patients with MSS CLM, VB-111 and nivolumab did not improve overall response rate or survival but were tolerated with minimal toxicities. While challenging to distinguish between antiviral or antitumor, correlative studies demonstrated an immune response with activation and proliferation of CD8(+) T cells systemically that was poorly sustained.

131,Phase 1 trial of apatinib combined with intensity-modulated radiotherapy in unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma.,10.1186/s12885-022-09819-3,"BACKGROUND: To investigate the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of apatinib delivered during and after intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) for unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). METHODS: Patients with unresectable HCC who were not eligible for radiofrequency ablation (RFA), transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (TACE), or residual/ recurrent after the prior local treatment were enrolled. Patients were scheduled to be treated with IMRT at 50-60 Gy/25-30 fractions. Oral apatinib tablets were administered concurrently with IMRT and continued thereafter. We used a 3 + 3 dose-escalation design, with three dose levels of apatinib (250, 500, and 750 mg). Grade 3 or more severe adverse events (AEs) were defined as dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs). The treatment response was calculated using the Modified Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumours. RESULTS: Nine patients with Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer Stage C were included. One patient withdrew from the apatinib 250 mg group and another patient was added. No DLTs occurred in the apatinib 250 mg group. Five patients were included in the apatinib 500 mg group, and 2 cases of DLT (grade 3 leukopenia) were found among them. Dose escalation was terminated and the MTD was determined to be 250 mg. Common grade 1-2 AEs included fatigue, hypertension, dizziness, bone marrow suppression, and hyperbilirubinemia. The median follow-up time for all patients was 16.0 months. Three patients achieved complete response and another three achieved partial response. The objective response rate was 6/9 (66.7%), and the disease control rate was 9/9 (100%). Three patients relapsed out of the radiation field. The median progression-free survival was 17.0 months, and the median overall survival was 16.7 months. CONCLUSIONS: When combined with IMRT, apatinib 250 mg daily was recommended for a phase 2 study of unresectable HCC. The antitumor activity of the combination treatment was encouraging. The safety and efficacy of apatinib combined with IMRT for unresectable HCC should be further investigated in future studies. TRIAL REGISTRATION: Registration No. ChiCTR1800018309 .

132,Stereotactic Radiotherapy after Incomplete Transarterial (Chemo-) Embolization (TAE\TACE) versus Exclusive TAE or TACE for Treatment of Inoperable HCC: A Phase III Trial (NCT02323360).,10.3390/curroncol29110692,"Background: Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the most frequent liver malignancy and a leading cause of cancer death in the world. In unresectable HCC patients, transcatheter arterial (chemo-) embolization (TAE/TACE) has shown a disease response in 15-55% of cases. Though multiple TAE/TACE courses can be administered in principle, Stereotactic Body Radiotherapy (SBRT) has emerged as an alternative option in the case of local relapse following multiple TAE/TACE courses. Methods: This is a single-center, prospective, randomized, controlled, parallel-group superiority trial of SBRT versus standard TAE/TACE for the curative treatment of the intermediate stage of HCC after an incomplete response following TAE/TACE (NCT02323360). The primary endpoint is 1-year local control (LC): 18 events were needed to assess a 45% difference (HR: 0.18) in favor of SBRT. The secondary endpoints are 1-year Progression-Free Survival (PFS), Distant Recurrence-Free Survival (DRFS), Overall Survival (OS) and the incidence of acute and late complications. Results: At the time of the final analysis, 40 patients were enrolled, 19 (49%) in the TAE/TACE arm and 21 (51%) in the SBRT arm. The trial was prematurely closed due to slow accrual. The 1- and 2-year LC rates were 57% and 36%. The use of SBRT resulted in superior LC as compared to TAE/TACE rechallenge (median not reached versus 8 months, p = 0.0002). PFS was 29% and 16% at 1 and 2 years, respectively. OS was 86% and 62% at 1 year and 2 years, respectively. In the TAE arm, PFS was 13% and 6% at 1 and 2 years, respectively. In the SBRT arm, at 1 and 2 years, PFS was 37% and 21%, respectively. OS at 1 and 2 years was 75% and 64% in the SBRT arm and 95% and 57% in the TACE arm, respectively. No grade >3 toxicity was recorded.

133,Impact of Transarterial Chemoembolization or Hepatic Artery Infusion Chemotherapy on Liver Function after Hepatocellular Carcinoma Resection: An Observational Study.,10.1159/000528750,"INTRODUCTION: Liver surgery leads to a high degree of heterogeneity in the prognosis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients. However, most previous studies focused on the postoperative therapeutic effects of other treatments, with relatively few studies on the impacts on liver function. This study investigated the impact of transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) and hepatic artery infusion chemotherapy (HAIC) on liver function after HCC resection from various angles. METHODS: 138 HCC patients were enrolled, including 27 patients who received TACE and 80 patients who received HAIC. Besides routine treatment such as liver protection and antiviral therapy, 31 patients received no other treatment. The different groups were compared with various biological parameters with four types of scoring methods. RESULTS: In the short term after TACE, the mean (±SD) alanine transaminase and aspartate transaminase values increased by 79.22 ± 117.43 U/L and 66.33 ± 94.54 U/L, respectively (p < 0.01). The mean (±SD) total bilirubin (TBIL) values increased by 4.02 ± 6.08 μmol/L (p < 0.01). The mean (±SD) albumin (ALB) values decreased by 3.54 ± 2.93 g/L (p < 0.001). The mean (±SD) albumin bilirubin (ALBI) scores increased by 0.39 ± 0.22 (p < 0.001). In the short term after HAIC, the mean (±SD) TBIL values increased by 2.11 ± 5.57 μmol/L (p < 0.01). The mean (±SD) ALB values decreased by 2.52 ± 3.26 g/L (p < 0.001), and the mean (±SD) ALBI scores increased by 0.21 ± 0.42 (p < 0.001). In both treatment groups, the long-term liver function was not significantly different from that before treatment and also from that of the untreated group (p > 0.05). CONCLUSION: TACE after HCC resection has a significant impact on short-term liver function, whereas HAIC has a relatively small impact, but neither has a major impact on long-term liver function.",Yue R; Liu X
134,An algorithm for simplified hepatitis C virus treatment with non-specialist care based on nation-wide data from Taiwan.,10.1007/s12072-023-10609-7,"BACKGROUND: Both European Association for the Study of the Liver (EASL) and American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases and the Infectious Diseases Society of America (AASLD-IDSA) guidelines recommend simplified hepatitis C virus (HCV) treatment with pan-genotypic sofosbuvir/velpatasvir or glecaprevir/pibrentasvir for eligible patients. This observational study used real-world data to assess these regimens' safety in eligible patients and develop an algorithm to identify patients suitable for simplified treatment by non-specialists. METHODS: 7,677 HCV-infected patients from Taiwan Hepatitis C Registry (TACR) who received at least one dose of sofosbuvir/velpatasvir or glecaprevir/pibrentasvir, and fulfilled the EASL/AASLD-IDSA criteria for simplified treatment were analyzed. Multivariate analysis was conducted on patient characteristics and safety data. RESULTS: Overall, 92.8% (7,128/7,677) of patients achieved sustained virological response and only 1.9% (146/7,677) experienced Grades 2-4 laboratory abnormalities in key liver function parameters (alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, and total bilirubin), with only 18 patients (0.23%) experiencing Grades 3-4 abnormalities. Age > 70 years old, presence of hepatocellular carcinoma, total bilirubin > 1.2 mg/dL, estimated glomerular filtration rate < 60 mL/min/1.73 m(2), and Fibrosis-4 > 3.25 were associated with higher risks of Grades 2-4 abnormalities. Patients with any of these had an odds of 4.53 times than that of those without in developing Grades 2-4 abnormalities (p < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Real-world data from Taiwan confirmed that simplified HCV treatment for eligible patients with pan-genotypic regimens is effective and well tolerated.

This study aimed to compare the efficacy and safety of TIPS with endoscopic + β-blocker for prevention of the rebleeding in such patients. METHODS: 106 consecutive advanced HCC patients receiving tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) who had been treated with vasoactive drugs plus endoscopic therapy for variceal bleeding were randomly assigned to receive either TIPS (n = 52) or endoscopic + β-blocker therapy (n = 54) for the prevention of rebleeding. The primary endpoint was variceal rebleeding after randomization. RESULTS: During a median follow-up of 16 months, rebleeding occurred in 14 patients in the endoscopic + β-blocker group and 3 patients in the TIPS group (p < 0.001). Forty-nine patients died (38 in endoscopic + β-blocker group and 11 in TIPS group, p < 0.001). The 6-, 12-, and 18-month overall survival rates were 95, 81, and 73% for TIPS group and 35, 21, and 15% for endoscopic + β-blocker group, respectively (p < 0.001). Eight patients in endoscopic + β-blocker group received TIPS as rescue therapy, but two died. TKIs was discontinued in 32 patients, including 24 in the endoscopic + β-blocker group and 8 in the TIPS group (p < 0.001). No significant differences were observed between the two groups with respect to serious adverse events.

MATERIAL AND METHODS: In this prospective study (NCT04866290), 100 adults with confirmed mCRC to the liver who were ineligible for resection were enrolled and followed up to 24 months or death. Study outcomes among Salvage (patients not tolerating more cycles of chemotherapy) and Non-salvage patients included overall survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS), objective response (OR), objective response rate (ORR), best tumor response (BTR), adverse events (AEs), and pharmacokinetics of irinotecan and its active metabolite, 7-ethyl-10-hydroxy-camptothecin (SN38). RESULTS: The median age was 66 years (range: 31-89). Median OS was 15.08 months (95% confidence interval [CI]: 12.33-17.25). PFS was 8.52 months (95% CI: 6.0-9.0; p < 0.001). ORR was 42.2% (95% CI: 31.57-53.50) and 35.9% (95% CI: 25.57-47.62) based on modified RECIST (Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors) and RECIST 1.1 criteria. BTR was not significantly different between mRECIST and RECIST (p = 0.745). The Non-salvage group had a statistically significant difference in median OS relative to the Salvage group (15.3 vs. 3 months; p < 0.001). Pharmacokinetic analyses demonstrated no correlation of OS with plasma concentration of irinotecan and SN38 (all p > 0.05).

METHODS: In this retrospective multi-center study, treatment-naïve HBV-related decompensated patients were enrolled at first decompensating event of ascites and/or variceal bleeding. Further complications and clinical characteristics were collected using standard case report form every 6 months to year-5 of antiviral treatment. Recompensation was defined as maintaining free of decompensation for one year and achieving liver function within Child-Pugh A and/or MELD < 10. RESULTS: Totally, 170 (170/298, 57.0%) patients in ascites group of 298 (298/383, 77.8%) treatment-naïve decompensated patients and 33 (33/85, 38.8%) in bleeding group of 85 (85/383, 22.2%) patients, achieved recompensation. Ascites group had higher 5-year rate of recompensation than bleeding group (63.3% vs. 46.5%, p = 0.012), respectively. Patients achieving recompensation in ascites group maintained lower rate of second decompensation than these in bleeding group (at year-5: 26.7% vs. 43.3%, p = 0.032). Specifically, recompensated patients in ascites group had predominantly 5-year rate of further ascites (24.0%) and lower rate of further bleeding (6.0%), which differed from the pattern of these in bleeding group, with lower rate of further ascites (16.0%, p = 0.599) and significantly higher rate of further bleeding (33.9%, p < 0.001). Both patients had superior long-term prognosis (death/LT rate at year-5: 0.6% vs. 3.0%, p = 0.196).

Methods: 56 patients who underwent TACE in our hospital from March 2022 to March 2023 were selected as the study subjects. The patients were randomly divided into a control group (28 cases) and an intervention group (28 cases). The control group received routine dietary intervention, while the intervention group received individualized nutritional intervention. We analyzed the body mass index (BMI), nutritional risk screening 2002 (NRS 2002), nutritional status, liver function status, and incidence of complications in two groups of patients before TACE, 3 days after TACE, and 1 month after TACE. Results: on the third day after TACE, the nutritional related indicators of both groups of patients showed a significantly decrease compared to those before TACE (p < 0.05), while the majority of liver function indicators significantly increased (p < 0.05). Compared with those at 3 days after TACE, the nutritional status of the intervention group patients significantly improved (p < 0.05) and liver function indicators significantly decreased (p < 0.05) 1 month after TACE. One month after TACE, all nutritional indicators in the intervention group were significantly higher than those in the control group (p < 0.05), and AST was significantly lower than that in the control group (p < 0.05). The incidence of gastrointestinal complications and electrolyte disorders in the intervention group were significantly lower than that in the control group (p < 0.05). Conclusion Individualized nutritional intervention can effectively improve nutritional status, improve liver function, and reduce the incidence of postoperative complications in liver cancer patients after TACE.

139,Progression patterns and therapeutic sequencing following immune checkpoint inhibition for hepatocellular carcinoma: An international observational study.,10.1111/liv.15502,"BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Different approaches are available after the progression of disease (PD) to immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), including the continuation of ICI, treatment switching to tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) and cessation of anticancer therapy. We sought to characterise the relationship between radiological patterns of progression and survival post-ICI, also appraising treatment strategies. METHODS: We screened 604 HCC patients treated with ICIs, including only those who experienced PD by data cut-off. We evaluated post-progression survival (PPS) according to the treatment strategy at PD and verified its relationship with radiological patterns of progression: intrahepatic growth (IHG), new intrahepatic lesion (NIH), extrahepatic growth (EHG), new extrahepatic lesion (NEH) and new vascular invasion (nVI). RESULTS: Of 604 patients, 364 (60.3%) experienced PD during observation. Median PPS was 5.3 months (95% CI: 4.4-6.9; 271 events). At the data cut-off, 165 patients (45%) received no post-progression anticancer therapy; 64 patients (17.6%) continued ICI beyond PD. IHG (HR 1.64 [95% CI: 1.21-2.22]; p = .0013) and nVI (HR 2.15 [95% CI: 1.38-3.35]; p = .0007) were associated with shorter PPS. Multivariate models adjusted for progression patterns, treatment line and albumin-bilirubin grade and Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status at PD confirmed receipt of ICI beyond PD with (HR 0.17, 95% CI: 0.09-0.32; p < .0001) or without subsequent TKI (HR 0.39, 95% CI: 0.26-0.58; p < .0001) as predictors of prolonged PPS versus no anticancer therapy. CONCLUSIONS: ICI-TKI sequencing is a consolidated option in advanced HCC. nVI and IHG predict a poorer prognosis. Despite lack of recommendation, the continuation of ICI beyond progression in HCC is adopted clinically: future efforts should appraise which patients benefit from this approach.",Talbot T; D'Alessio A; Pinter M; Balcar L; Scheiner B; Marron TU; Jun T; Dharmapuri S; Ang C; Saeed A; Hildebrand H; Muzaffar M; Fulgenzi CAM; Amara S; Naqash AR; Gampa A; Pillai A; Wang Y; Khan U; Lee PC; Huang YH; Bengsch B; Bettinger D; Mohamed YI; Kaseb A; Pressiani T; Personeni N; Rimassa L; Nishida N; Kudo M; Weinmann A; Galle PR; Muhammed A; Cortellini A; Vogel A; Pinato DJ
140,Chemoembolization combined radiofrequency ablation vs. chemoembolization alone for treatment of beyond the Milan criteria viable hepatocellular carcinoma (CERFA): study protocol for a randomized controlled trial.,10.1186/s13063-023-07266-4,"BACKGROUND: Many previous studies evaluated a combination of transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (TACE) and radiofrequency ablation (RFA) for treating early hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC); however, studies evaluating combination therapy for beyond-the-Milan criteria HCC are scarce. METHODS: A total of 120 patients with beyond-the-Milan criteria HCC who have viable tumour after first TACE will be enrolled in this multi-institutional, parallel, pragmatic, randomized controlled trial. Patients with metastasis, vascular invasion, or a sum of tumour diameter > 8 cm will be excluded. Eligible patients will be randomly assigned to combination TACE and RFA therapy or TACE monotherapy groups. Patients in the combination therapy group will receive a second TACE and subsequent RFA at the viable tumour. Patients in the TACE monotherapy group will receive only second TACE. Patients in both groups will undergo magnetic resonance imaging 4-6 weeks after second TACE. The primary endpoint is 1-month tumour response, and secondary endpoints are progression-free survival, overall response rate, number of treatments until CR, overall survival, and change in liver function. DISCUSSION: Although TACE can be used to treat intermediate-stage HCC, it is difficult to achieve CR by first TACE in most intermediate-stage patients. Recent studies show a survival advantage of combination therapy over monotherapy. However, most studies evaluating combination therapy included patients with a single tumour sized < 5 cm, and no studies included patients with intermediate-stage but more advanced (i.e., beyond-the-Milan criteria) HCC. This study will evaluate the efficacy of combined TACE and RFA therapy for patients with advanced HCC within the intermediate stage.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Fifty-four patients with untreated advanced HCC who could not be resected were randomly divided into the ANL group (n = 27) and ANL+S-1 group (n = 27). The ANL group was given 10 mg ANL orally once a day for 14 consecutive days, stopped for 1 week, and repeated every 21 days. The ANL+S-1 group was given 10 mg ANL once a day orally and 40 mg S-1 twice a day orally for 14 consecutive days, stopped for 1 week, repeated every 21 days. All patients were treated until the disease progressed or toxicity became unacceptable. For patients who could not tolerate adverse reactions, the ANL dose should be reduced to 8 mg per day. CT or MRI was reviewed every 6 weeks to evaluate the efficacy. RESULTS: A total of 44 patients were included in the results analysis, including 22 patients in the ANL group and 22 patients in the ANL+S-1 group. In the ANL group, the objective response rate (ORR) was 4.5% (1/22), the disease control rate (DCR) was 77.3% (17/22), the median progression-free survival (PFS) was 4.2 months (95% CI: 3.6-6.0) and the median overall survival (mOS) was 7.0 months (95% CI: 6.3-9.0). In the ANL+S-1 group, the ORR was 18.2% (4/22), the DCR was 59.1% (13/22), the median PFS was 4.0 months (95% CI: 3.6-5.4) and the mOS was 6.0 months (95% CI: 5.5-7.4). There was no significant difference in ORR (p = 0.345) or DCR (p = 0.195) between the two groups. Adverse reactions were mainly hypertension, anorexia, fatigue, liver transaminase heightened and hand and foot skin reaction.

Thirty-one patients treated with atezolizumab plus bevacizumab for unresectable HCC and previously treated with MTAs were enrolled in this study. The treatment lines ranged from second to sixth lines. The treatment effect on HCC differed from that during first-line treatment. The treatment effect was determined using the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) and modified RECIST. The treatment response was different for each MTA immediately prior to atezolizumab + bevacizumab treatment. Tumors treated with lenvatinib followed by atezolizumab + bevacizumab showed rapid growth for a short period of time followed by shrinkage. However, patients who received ramucirumab, sorafenib, and regorafenib did not show such changes. This was likely because of differences in the mechanism of action of the MTA administered immediately beforehand. The side-effect profile differed from that observed in the IMbrave150 phase 3 study of atezolizumab plus bevacizumab, which showed more adverse events related to hepatic reserve.

This study aims to evaluate the response to Transarterial Chemoembolization (TACE) in relation to the genetic polymorphisms of interleukin 28B (IL28B) and angiopoietin-2 (ANGPT2) in HCC patients. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Prospective cohort study conducted on 104 eligible HCC Egyptian patients who underwent TACE using doxorubicin and lipiodol. Genotyping of the IL28B and ANGPT2 genes was performed with laboratory data analysis. RESULTS: At baseline IL28B rs12979860 genotypes C/T, C/C and T/T appeared in 43.9%, 34.6% and 21.5% while ANGPT2 rs55633437 genotypes C/C, C/A and A/A found in 71.03%, 28.04% and 0.93% of patients respectively. After one month of therapy, 51.4% of patients achieved a complete response. There was a significant difference in relation to IL28B rs12979860 genotypes (p = 0.017) whereas ANGPT2 rs55633437 genotypes (p = 0.432) showed no significant difference in patient response after one month of TACE. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates the effectiveness of TACE in Egyptian HCC patients, as evidenced by low recurrence rates. Furthermore, the IL28B rs12979860 (C/T) gene may be associated with the efficacy and prognosis of TACE treatment in HCC Egyptian patients.

147,Multipolar radiofrequency ablation via three bipolar electrodes with C-arm type X-ray fluoroscopy assistance for hepatocellular carcinoma: An observational study.,10.1097/MD.0000000000030725,"The present study aimed to investigate the therapeutic efficacy and safety of the insertion technique of 3 bipolar electrodes in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), using C-arm type X-ray fluoroscopy-assisted ultrasonography (US) in guiding a multipolar radiofrequency ablation (RFA) system. Seventy-three patients with HCC treated with a multipolar RFA system (1 electrode, n = 2; 2 electrodes, n = 56; 3 electrodes, n = 17) were enrolled in this retrospective cohort study. To analyze their therapeutic outcome in this study, we divided among 17 patients using 3 electrodes into 2 subgroups: the C-arm type X-ray fluoroscopy-assisted (n = 7) and the US-guided alone groups (n = 10). Therapeutic efficacy and safety were analyzed between the 2 groups. Multipolar RFA treatment was performed safely in all cases, and no severe adverse events occurred. Comparing the patient background of the group treated using 1 or 2 electrodes with that treated using 3 electrodes, larger-sized HCC was treated using 3 electrodes (P < .001). The differences in overall and recurrence-free survival rates between the 1- or 2-electrode and the 3-electrode groups were not significantly different (P = .843 and P = .891). Comparing the C-arm type X-ray fluoroscopy-assisted and the US-guided alone groups among patients treated using 3 electrodes, technical factors such as total ablation time and the number of sessions were not significantly different between the 2 groups. The local tumor progression rate was not significantly different between the 2 groups (P = .942). Multipolar RFA treatment was effective for the treating HCC; using 3 electrodes was suitable for larger-sized HCCs. The technical approach with C-arm type X-ray fluoroscopy assistance using 3 electrodes was useful for operators to perform safe and appropriate insertion techniques by synchronizing the US and X-ray fluoroscopy images.",Tanaka T; Anan A; Takata K; Fukuda H; Yamauchi R; Inomata S; Yokoyama K; Takeyama Y; Shakado S; Sakisaka S; Hirai F
148,Occupational dose and associated factors during transarterial chemoembolization of hepatocellular carcinoma using real-time dosimetry: A simple way to reduce radiation exposure.,10.1097/MD.0000000000028744,"Transarterial chemoembolization is the standard treatment option for intermediate-stage hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). However, during the interventional procedure, occupational radiation protection is compromised. The use of real-time radiation dosimetry could provide instantaneous radiation doses. This study aimed to evaluate the occupational dose of the medical staff using a real-time radiation dosimeter during transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) for HCC, and to investigate factors affecting the radiation exposure dose.This retrospective observational study included 70 patients (mean age: 66 years; age range: 38-88 years; male: female = 59: 11) who underwent TACE using real-time radiation dosimetry systems between August 2018 and February 2019. Radiation exposure doses of operators, assistants, and technicians were evaluated. Patients' clinical, imaging, and procedural information was analyzed.The mean dose-area product (DAP) and fluoroscopy time during TACE were 66.72 ± 55.14 Gycm2 and 12.03 ± 5.95 minutes, respectively. The mean radiation exposure doses were 24.8 ± 19.5, 2.0 ± 2.2, and 1.65 ± 2.0 μSv for operators, assistants, and technicians, respectively. The radiation exposure of the operators was significantly higher than that of the assistants or technicians (P < .001). The perpendicular position of the adjustable upper-body lead protector (AULP) on the table was one factor reducing in the radiation exposure of the assistants (P < .001) and technicians (P = .040). The DAP was a risk factor for the radiation exposure of the operators (P = .003) and technicians (P < .001).Occupational doses during TACE are affected by DAP and AULP positioning. Placing the AULP in the perpendicular position during fluoroscopy could be a simple and effective way to reduce the radiation exposure of the staff. As the occupational dose influencing factors vary by region or institution, further study is needed.",Kim HO; Lee BC; Park C; Kim JK; Park WJ; Lee JE; Lim HS; Jeong WG
149,Transarterial Chemoembolization Combined With PD-1 Inhibitors Plus Lenvatinib Showed Improved Efficacy for Treatment of Unresectable Hepatocellular Carcinoma Compared With PD-1 Inhibitors Plus Lenvatinib.,10.1177/15330338231166765,"Background: Programmed cell death protein-1 inhibitors combined with lenvatinib have become a popular treatment option for patients with unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma. Transarterial chemoembolization combined with programmed cell death protein-1 inhibitors and lenvatinib has also shown preliminary efficacy in the unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma. We conducted this observational, retrospective, cohort study to compare the clinical outcomes and safety of transarterial chemoembolization combined with programmed cell death protein-1 inhibitors plus lenvatinib versus programmed cell death protein-1 inhibitors plus lenvatinib in patients with unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma. Methods: Between November 2019 and November 2021, patients who were diagnosed with unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma and received transarterial chemoembolization combined with programmed cell death protein-1 inhibitors plus lenvatinib or programmed cell death protein-1 inhibitors plus lenvatinib treatment were reviewed for eligibility. The primary endpoints included objective response rate, overall survival, and progression-free survival. The secondary endpoint was the frequency of key adverse events. Results: In total, 105 patients were eligible for the present study, and they were divided into the transarterial chemoembolization combined with programmed cell death protein-1 inhibitors plus lenvatinib group (n = 46) and the programmed cell death protein-1 inhibitors plus lenvatinib group (n = 59). The patient cohort after a one-to-one propensity score matching (n = 86) was also analyzed. The transarterial chemoembolization combined with programmed cell death protein-1 inhibitors plus lenvatinib group had a higher objective response rate both in the patient cohort before propensity score matching (54.3% vs 25.4%, P = .002) and after propensity score matching (55.8% vs 30.2%, P = .017). The patients in the transarterial chemoembolization combined with programmed cell death protein-1 inhibitors plus lenvatinib group had prolonged overall survival (median, 20.5 vs 12.6 months, P = .015) and progression-free survival (median, 10.2 vs 7.4 months, P = .035). For patient cohort- propensity score matching, the overall survival (20.5 vs 12.8 months, P = .013) and progression-free survival (12.1 vs 7.8 months, P = .030) were also significantly better in the transarterial chemoembolization combined with programmed cell death protein-1 inhibitors plus lenvatinib group than in the programmed cell death protein-1 inhibitors plus lenvatinib group. There were no significant differences between the 2 groups concerning adverse reactions caused by immunotherapy and lenvatinib. The adverse reactions caused by transarterial chemoembolization were transient and were quickly reversed. Conclusions: Compared to programmed cell death protein-1 inhibitors plus lenvatinib, transarterial chemoembolization combined with programmed cell death protein-1 inhibitors plus lenvatinib may provide better treatment response and survival benefits for patients with unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma, and the adverse events were manageable.",Wang J; Zhao M; Han G; Han X; Shi J; Mi L; Li N; Yin X; Duan X; Hou J; Yin F
150,Does autoimmune disease impair the survival of hepatocellular carcinoma patients undergoing liver resection? A multi-institutional observational study.,10.1007/s00432-024-05885-1,"BACKGROUND: Patients with autoimmune diseases (AD) generally carry an increased risk of developing cancer. However, the effect of AD in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients receiving surgical treatment is uncertain. The present study aimed to investigate the potential influence of AD on the survival of HCC patients undergoing hepatectomies. METHODS: Operated HCC patients were identified from the Chang Gung Research Database, and the survival outcomes of HCC patients with or without AD were analyzed ad compared. Cox regression model was performed to identify significant risk factors associated with disease recurrence and mortality. RESULTS: From 2002 to 2018, a total of 5532 patients underwent hepatectomy for their HCC. Among them, 229 patients were identified to have AD and 5303 were not. After excluding cases who died within 30 days of surgery, the estimated median overall survival (OS) was 43.8 months in the AD (+) group and 47.4 months in the AD (-) group (P = 0.367). The median liver-specific survival and disease-free survival (DFS) were also comparable between the two groups. After Cox regression multivariate analysis, the presence of AD did not lead to a higher risk of all-cause mortality, liver-specific mortality, or disease recurrence. CONCLUSION: Our study demonstrated that autoimmune disease does not impair the OS and DFS of HCC patients undergoing liver resections. AD itself is not a risk factor for tumor recurrence after surgery. Patients eligible for liver resections, as a result, should be considered for surgery irrespective of the presence of AD. Further studies are mandatory to validate our findings.",Lee CW; Chen HY; Tsai PH; Lee WC; Wang CC; Yu MC; Chen CW; Lin PT; Chen BH; Wang SF; Chai PM; Tsai HI
151,Recurrence hazard rate in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma and bile duct tumor thrombus: a multicenter observational study.,10.1016/j.hpb.2022.04.007,"BACKGROUND: Patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) bile duct tumor thrombus (BDTT) have a high rate of postoperative recurrence. We aimed to describe the patterns and kinetics of recurrence in BDTT patients and provide management options accordingly. METHODS: This retrospective study included 311 HCC patients with BDTT who underwent surgery from 2009 to 2017 at five centers in China. The hazard rate of recurrence was calculated using the hazard function. RESULTS: The hazard rate of intrahepatic recurrence was higher than that of extrahepatic recurrence (0.0588 vs. 0.0301), and both showed a decreasing trend, and the intrahepatic recurrence and extrahepatic recurrence risk decreased to a lower level after 40 and 20 months, respectively. Patients who underwent anatomic resection had a consistently lower hazard rate of recurrence than patients who underwent nonanatomic resection, whereas patients who received postoperative adjuvant transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) mainly had a lower hazard rate of recurrence in the first year than patients who did not. CONCLUSION: The follow-up of BDTT patients should be at least 40 months because of its high rate of recurrence, in parallel with the need for vigilance for extrahepatic recurrence within 20 months. Anatomic hepatectomy and adjuvant TACE are recommended to improve BDTT patient outcomes. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

153,The impact of preoperative interview and prospective nursing on perioperative psychological stress and postoperative complications in patients undergoing TACE intervention for hepatocellular carcinoma.,10.1097/MD.0000000000035929,"TACE has become one of the main methods for the treatment of liver cancer. The study aimed to investigate the effects of preoperative interview and prospective nursing in patients with hepatic carcinoma undergoing transcatheter chemoembolization (TACE). Eighty-six patients with hepatocellular carcinoma who underwent TACE intervention treatment at our hospital between 2020 and 2023 were selected and randomly assigned to 2 groups using computerized randomization. The control group (n = 43) received routine nursing care, while the study group (n = 43) received preoperative interviews in combination with prospective nursing during the procedure. The patients' heart rate, mean arterial pressure, and blood pressure variations were recorded, along with their mood changes after intervention. The postoperative pain and satisfaction levels were compared between the 2 groups of patients, and the incidence of postoperative complications was observed. The heart rate, systolic blood pressure, and diastolic blood pressure of the 2 groups of patients were compared 1 day before the operation (P > .05). Compared to 1 day before the operation, there was no significant change for the study group at 10 minutes after entering the room. However, the control group showed an increase. Both groups showed an increase in heart rate, systolic blood pressure, and diastolic blood pressure after the operation, with the study group having lower values than the control group (P < .05). The levels of tension, fatigue, anxiety, energy, anger, depression, self-esteem, and POMS index were compared between the 2 groups before intervention (P > .05). After intervention, there were significant differences between the 2 groups(P < .05). Immediately after the operation, the NRS scores of the 2 groups of patients were compared (P > .05). Compared to the control group, the study group showed a decrease in NRS scores at 12, 24, and 48 hours after the operation (P < .05). The nursing satisfaction rate of the study group patients was 97.67% (42/43), which was higher than the nursing satisfaction rate of the control group of 76.74% (33/43) (P < .05). Compared to routine nursing, preoperative visits and prospective nursing interventions can effectively alleviate patients' psychological stress reactions, relieve pain, reduce the incidence of complications, and improve patients' satisfaction with nursing care.",Gao L; Chen W; Qin S; Yang X
154,Clinical feasibility of radiofrequency ablation using novel adjustable separable electrodes with a multipurpose needle for treating small hepatocellular carcinomas: a prospective single center study.,10.1080/02656736.2023.2235102,"BACKGROUND: The novel separable clustered electrode system with two adjustable active tips (ICAEs) and a fine multipurpose needle (MPN) for in situ temperature monitoring and adjuvant agent injection was developed and validated in an animal study. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the technical efficacy and complication of the novel electrode system for patients who have small HCC. METHODS: In this prospective, single-center clinical trial, ten participants with 14 small (≤ 2 cm, BCLC 0-A) HCCs referred for RFA were enrolled. A novel electrode system consisting of two ICAEs and one MPN with a thermometer and side holes was used for RFA. The RF energy was delivered using a multichannel RF system combining bipolar and switching monopolar modes. Technical success, efficacy, and complications were evaluated on immediate and one-month follow-up CT. RESULTS: Technical success was achieved in 92.9% (13/14) of tumors. One participant withdrew consent after RFA, and technical efficacy was achieved in 91.7% (11/12) of tumors. None showed thermal injury to nontarget organs. All patients were discharged the day after RFA without major complications. The active electrode lengths were adjusted in 60% (6/10) of patients during the procedure to tailor the ablation zone (83.3%, n = 5) or treat two tumors with different sizes (16.7%, n = 1). MPN was capable of continuous temperature monitoring during all ablations (100%, 14/14). CONCLUSIONS: RFA using a novel electrode system showed acceptable technical efficacy and safety in patients with small HCCs. Further comparative studies are needed for the investigation of the system's potential benefits compared to conventional electrodes.",Kim SW; Lee JM; Kim JH; Park SJ; Yoon JH; Joo I
155,Construction and Validation of Prediction Model of Severe Abdominal Pain Post-Transarterial Chemoembolization in Patients with HBV-Associated Primary Liver Cancer.,10.1155/2022/5203166,"OBJECTIVE: This study is aimed at constructing and evaluating a prediction model of severe abdominal pain post-transcatheter arterial chemoembolization in patients with HBV-related primary liver cancer. METHODS: Patients with HBV-associated primary liver cancer who received transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) from March 2019 to March 2022 in the Interventional Therapy Department of our hospital were selected as the subjects, and the included 160 patients were randomly divided into modeling group (n = 120) and validation group (n = 40) in a ratio of 3 : 1. Visual analog scale (VAS) was used to assess pain severity. 120 patients in the modeling group were divided into no/mild abdominal pain group and severe abdominal pain group. The clinical data of the patients, including gender, age, TACE treatment history, vascular invasion, maximum diameter of tumor, infarction degree, preoperative Eastern Oncology Collaboration Group (ECOG) score, and Lipiodol dosage, were analyzed. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was used to evaluate the predictive value of the prediction model for severe abdominal pain post-TACE. RESULTS: A total of 116 patients (72.50%) had severe abdominal pain after TACE. Univariate analysis showed that severe abdominal pain after TACE in the modeling group was associated with TACE treatment history, maximum tumor diameter, infarction degree, and preoperative ECOG score (all P < 0.05), but not related to gender, age, vascular invasion, and Lipiodol dosage (all P > 0.05). Logistic regression analysis showed that TACE treatment history, maximum tumor diameter, infarction degree, and preoperative ECOG score were all independent influencing factors for acute abdominal pain post-TACE in HBV-HCC patients (all P < 0.05). The prediction model equation was Y = -3.673 + 1.722 × TACE treatment history + 1.175 × tumor maximum diameter + 2.064 × infarction degree + 1.555 × preoperative ECOG score. Goodness-of-fit test results showed no significant difference between the established prediction model and the observed value (χ (2) = 1.645, P = 0.560) and R (2) = 0.821, suggesting that the prediction ability of the model was relatively accurate. ROC analysis results showed that the area under the curve (AUC) of severe abdominal pain after TACE was 0.916 (0.862~0.970) and 0.902 (95% CI: 0.841~0.963) in the modeling group and the verification group, respectively. CONCLUSION: TACE treatment history, tumor maximum diameter, infarction degree, and preoperative ECOG score are independent influencing factors for severe abdominal pain post-TACE in patients with HBV-HCC, and the prediction model established on this basis has good application value.",Yang Y; Chen S; Yan Z; Jiao Y; Yan X; Li Y
156,Role of the pre- to postoperative alpha-fetoprotein ratio in the prognostic evaluation of liver cancer after radiofrequency ablation.,10.1177/03936155221101075,"OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to investigate the role of the alpha fetoprotein (AFP) ratio before and after radiofrequency ablation (RFA) in the prognosis of patients with liver cancer. METHODS: A total of 368 patients who underwent RFA for liver cancer in Shenzhen People's Hospital from 2010 to 2020 were randomly divided into the training group and the validation group. Levels of AFP before and after RFA were recorded and their ratios were calculated. RESULTS: Using the X-tile software, it was found that the optimal cut-off value of the AFP ratio in the training group was 37.9. Both in the training group and the validation group, the relapse-free survival and overall survival of patients with an AFP ratio <37.9 (high-risk group) were significantly shorter than those with an AFP ratio >37.9 (low-risk group) (training group, relapse-free survival, P = 0.0003; overall survival, P = 0.0186; validation group, relapse-free survival, P = 0.0490, overall survival, P = 0.0031). An AFP ratio <37.9 was an independent risk factor for recurrence and survival of liver cancer after RFA. CONCLUSION: The AFP ratio can predict the prognosis of patients with liver cancer after RFA. An AFP ratio <37.9 is an independent risk factor for tumor recurrence and survival after RFA.",Luo B; Liu L; Bi J; Bao S; Zhang Y
157,Clinical Outcomes of Radiological Treatment Modalities of Hepatocellular Carcinoma: A Single-Center Experience from Saudi Arabia.,,"BACKGROUND: Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the most common primary malignancy of the liver. Most patients with HCC are unsuitable for surgical therapies. Therefore, nonsurgical therapies play a central role in the management of this disease. Several percutaneous treatment modalities are available for HCC including radiofrequency ablation (RFA), transarterial chemoembolization (TACE), and transarterial radioembolization (TARE). In this study, we aim to evaluate the clinical outcomes, morbidity and mortality rates, and survival rates of four treatment modalities for HCC (RFA, TACE, TARE, and Sorafenib) and compare the success rate of each modality. METHODS: A retrospective observational study was conducted at King Abdulaziz Medical City in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia. The inclusion criteria were composed of patients diagnosed with HCC who received RFA, TACE, TARE, or Sorafenib treatments between 2008 and 2017. The primary outcome of this study was recurrence-free patients at the last follow-up. RESULTS: A total of 108 patients were included in this study. The mean age of the patients was 68.01 ± 9.98 years. Eighty-Two patients (75.9%) underwent interventions with the intention to cure or stabilize HCC, while twentysix patients (24.1%) were started on Sorafenib as a palliative treatment. The five years recurrence-free rates were 41.2% with RFA, 40% with the combination of TACE and RFA, 23.3% with TACE, and 0% with TARE. All patients on Sorafenib died from advanced-stage HCC. CONCLUSION: This study provides further evidence for the efficacy of several treatment modalities for the management of HCC. RFA and the combination of TACE and RFA showed better outcomes with a recurrence-free rate reaching up to 40%. TACE had a moderate survival benefit up to 23.3%. TARE showed negative survival benefits. Sorafenib continues to be an important palliative treatment but does not offer curative potential.",Dahlan YM; Shirah BH; Alghamdi AS; Al Kenawi AA; Sanai FM

MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this prospective single-center observational study, 52 patients with HCC were recruited from January 2019 to December 2021, their clinical data and blood samples were collected, and the relationship between sCCL14 and progression-free survival (PFS) and TACE treatment response was analyzed. RESULTS: Among the 52 patients with HCC (Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer [BCLC] Stage A, 25.0%; BCLC Stage B, 44.2%; and BCLC Stage C, 30.8%), patients with BCLC Stage C HCC had significantly lower sCCL14 levels than those of patients with BCLC Stages A and B HCC (P = .001). sCCL14 levels were significantly higher in the first week after treatment than before TACE treatment (P = .024). Baseline sCCL14 levels in patients who showed complete response after TACE treatment were significantly higher than those in other groups, and lower baseline sCCL14 values were associated with shorter PFS times. Multivariate Cox regression analysis showed that sCCL14 level (hazard ratio, 1.855; 95% CI, 1.039-3.311; P = .037) was an independent prognostic factor of PFS. sCCL14 levels negatively correlated with the proportion of B lymphocytes and regulatory T cells in circulating blood and positively correlated with the absolute T-lymphocyte count. CONCLUSIONS: sCCL14 may be a predictive biomarker of TACE effectiveness. Further studies are needed to validate and outline the role of combination immunotherapy.",Guo Y; Hu HT; Xu SJ; Xia WL; Li Y; Lu J; Zhao XH; Zhao Y; Li FT; Li HL
159,Cabozantinib plus atezolizumab for the treatment of advanced hepatocellular carcinoma: shedding light on the preclinical rationale and clinical trials.,10.1080/13543784.2022.2032641,"INTRODUCTION: Combining multikinase inhibitors (MKIs) with immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) in advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) has a strong biological rationale. Among MKIs, cabozantinib seems an ideal partner for ICIs, playing a potentially synergistic role via a spectrum of immunomodulatory actions. AREA COVERED: This paper discusses the preclinical rationale for combining cabozantinib and atezolizumab in advanced HCC. It examines the mechanism of action of these agents and highlights their synergistic activities in vitro. Other MKI plus ICI combinations under investigation are evaluated. The results of the phase 1b COSMIC-021 study testing cabozantinib plus atezolizumab across numerous tumor types are presented along with the study design and the recent results of the phase 3 COSMIC-312 trial evaluating this combination as a front-line option for advanced HCC. EXPERT OPINION: The eventual approval of novel combinations for advanced HCC will require careful patient selection and a refinement of study design for future trials. Regarding the search for predictive biomarkers, etiology and extent of disease may predict response to therapy. Moving cabozantinib to first-line, treatment sequencing should consider possible cross-resistance not only to ICIs but also to other MKIs. Finally, the response rates of such combinations may pave the way for their evaluation as peri-operative therapies.",Cammarota A; Zanuso V; D'Alessio A; Pressiani T; Personeni N; Rimassa L

METHODS: The phase 1 study involved phase 1a monotherapy dose-escalation (part 1) and phase 1b combination therapy dose escalation (part 2) and expansion (part 3). Various dosing schedules of CS1002 (0.3, 1, or 3 mg/kg every 3 weeks, or 3 mg/kg every 9 weeks) were evaluated with 200 mg CS1003 every 3 weeks in part 3. RESULTS: Parts 1, 2, and 3 included a total of 13, 18, and 61 patients, respectively. No dose-limiting toxicities or maximum tolerated doses were observed. Treatment-related adverse events (TRAEs) were reported in 30.8%, 83.3%, and 75.0% of patients in parts 1, 2, and 3, respectively. Grade ≥3 TRAEs were experienced by 15.4%, 50.0%, and 18.3% of patients in each part. Of 61 patients evaluable for efficacy, 23 (37.7%) achieved objective responses in multiple tumor types. Higher objective response rates were observed with conventional and high-dose CS1002 regimens (1 mg/kg every 3 weeks or 3 mg/kg every 9 weeks) compared to low-dose CS1002 (0.3 mg/kg every 3 weeks) in microsatellite instability-high/mismatch repair-deficient tumors, melanoma, and hepatocellular carcinoma (50.0% vs. 58.8%, 14.3% vs. 42.9%, and 0% vs. 16.7%). CONCLUSION: CS1002, as monotherapy, and in combination with CS1003, had a manageable safety profile across a broad dosing range. Promising antitumor activities were observed in patients with immune oncology (IO)-naive and IO-refractory tumors across CS1002 dose levels when combined with CS1003, supporting further evaluation of this treatment combination for solid tumors. PLAIN LANGUAGE SUMMARY: CS1002 is a human immunoglobulin (Ig) G1 monoclonal antibody that blocks the interaction of CTLA-4 with its ligands and increases T-cell activation/proliferation. CS1003, now named nofazinlimab, is a humanized, recombinant IgG4 monoclonal antibody that blocks the interaction between human PD-1 and its ligands. In this original article, we determined the safety profile of CS1002 as monotherapy and in combination with CS1003. Furthermore, we explored the antitumor activity of the combination in anti-programmed cell death protein (ligand)-1 (PD-[L]1)-naive microsatellite instability-high/mismatch repair-deficient (MSI-H/dMMR) pan tumors, and anti-PD-(L)1-refractory melanoma and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). CS1002 in combination with CS1003 had manageable safety profile across a broad dosing range and showed promising antitumor activities across CS1002 dose levels when combined with CS1003. This supports further assessment of CS1002 in combination with CS1003 for the treatment of solid tumors.",Bishnoi S; Kotasek D; Aghmesheh M; Yau T; Cosman R; Prawira A; Moore M; Chan SL; Mant A; Eek R; Zielinski R; Su R; Pan Z; Ma Y; Li F; Li P; Tse AN
161,Study Protocol: Adjuvant Holmium-166 Radioembolization After Radiofrequency Ablation in Early-Stage Hepatocellular Carcinoma Patients-A Dose-Finding Study (HORA EST HCC Trial).,10.1007/s00270-022-03162-7,"PURPOSE: To investigate the biodistribution of holmium-166 microspheres ((166)Ho-MS) when administered after radiofrequency ablation (RFA) of early-stage hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The aim is to establish a perfused liver administration dose that results in a tumoricidal dose of holmium-166 on the hyperaemic zone around the ablation necrosis (i.e. target volume). MATERIALS AND METHODS: This is a multicentre, prospective, dose-escalation study in HCC patients with a solitary lesion 2-5 cm, or a maximum of 3 lesions of ≤ 3 cm each. The day after RFA patients undergo angiography and cone-beam CT (CBCT) with (super)selective infusion of technetium-99 m labelled microalbumin aggregates ((99m)Tc-MAA). The perfused liver volume is segmented from the CBCT and (166)Ho-MS is administered to this treatment volume 5-10 days later. The dose of holmium-166 is escalated in a maximum of 3 patient cohorts (60 Gy, 90 Gy and 120 Gy) until the endpoint is reached. SPECT/CT is used to determine the biodistribution of holmium-166. The endpoint is met when a dose of ≥ 120 Gy has been reached on the target volume in 9/10 patients of a cohort. Secondary endpoints include toxicity, local recurrence, disease-free and overall survival. DISCUSSION: This study aims to find the optimal administration dose of adjuvant radioembolization with (166)Ho-MS after RFA. Ultimately, the goal is to bring the efficacy of thermal ablation up to par with surgical resection for early-stage HCC patients.

162,Protocol of notable-HCC: a phase Ib study of neoadjuvant tislelizumab with stereotactic body radiotherapy in patients with resectable hepatocellular carcinoma.,10.1136/bmjopen-2022-060955,"INTRODUCTION: Liver resection is the mainstay of curative-intent treatment for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), but the postoperative 5-year recurrence rate reaches 70%, and there are no adjuvant or neoadjuvant therapies recommended by major HCC guidelines that can reduce the risk of recurrence. In the recent decade, significant progress has been achieved in the systemic treatment of HCC, mainly from immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) and targeted therapy. In other malignancies, ICIs in the neoadjuvant setting have shown better outcomes than in the adjuvant setting. On the other hand, the addition of radiation to ICIs incrementally improves the systemic response to ICIs. Neoadjuvant therapy of ICIs plus stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) has shown promising results in several types of solid tumours but not HCC. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: Here, we describe a phase Ib clinical trial of neoadjuvant SBRT plus PD-1 (tislelizumab) prior to hepatic resection in HCC patients. Prior to resection, eligible HCC patients will receive 8 Gy×3 fractions of SBRT together with two cycles of tislelizumab with an interval of 3 weeks. HCC resection is scheduled 4 weeks after the second dose of tislelizumab, followed by adjuvant tislelizumab for 1 year. We plan to enrol 20 participants in this trial. The primary study endpoints include the delay of surgery, tumour response and safety and tolerability of the sequential SBRT/tislelizumab. Other endpoints are the disease-free survival and overall survival rates every 3 or 6 months after the surgery. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: This trial was approved by the Ethics Committee of Shandong Cancer Hospital and Institute (SDZLEC2022-021-01).

163,"Low applicability of the ''Six-and-twelve score"" in hepatocellular carcinoma treated with Drug-Eluting Beads Transarterial Chemoembolization.",10.17235/reed.2021.7696/2020,"OBJECTIVE: The effectiveness of transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) depends on the selection of suitable patients. The ''Six-and-twelve score"" distinguishes three groups of ideal patients with different overall survival, based on the sum of the number and size of tumors. This may impact on clinical practice and trial design. The aim of this study was to assess the reproducibility and prognostic value of the model in western patients treated with Drug-Eluting Beads (DEB)-TACE. METHODS: Observational, retrospective, unicentric study with consecutive compensated patients treated with DEB-TACE from October 2008 to October 2017. Exclusion criteria were Child-Pugh ≥ 8 and DEB-TACE used as a bridge to liver transplantation. RESULTS: 225 HCC consecutive patients were included; BCLC-0/A n=131 (single nodules > 5, n=29) and BCLC-B n=94. The median overall survival (OS) was 27 months (95% CI 23.8-30.2). OS was different between BCLC-0/A vs BCLC-B: 30 vs 24 months (p= 0.03), Child-Pugh A5 vs A6-B7: 30 vs 27 months (p= 0.003). ''Six-and-twelve score"" groups discriminated OS: group 1, n=123, 32 months (95% CI 27.5-63.5), group 2, n=101, 24 months (95% CI 19.6-28.4) and group 3, n=1, 27 months (p=0.024). When comparing the three scores, the ''Six-and-twelve score"" showed the best discrimination power: C-index 0.603, Akaike's information criterion (AIC) 1.642, likelihood ratio test (LRT) 16.21. CONCLUSION: The ''Six-and-twelve score"" is a prognostic tool for patients with HCC treated with DEB-TACE. However, few patients were included in the third group (score >12) and no differences were observed with BCLC, therefore its applicability is limited.  .",Pipa-Muñiz M; Castaño-García A; Sanmartino S; Mesa A; Álvarez-Navascués C; González-Diéguez ML; Cadahía-Rodrigo V; Piscoya-Díaz ME; Costilla-García SM; Rodríguez M; Varela M
164,Detection of hepatocellular carcinoma feeding vessels: MDCT angiography with 3D reconstruction versus digital subtraction angiography.,10.1186/s12880-024-01408-z,"BACKGROUND: Accurate detection of Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) feeding vessels during transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (TACE) is important for an effective treatment, while limiting non-target embolization. This study aimed to investigate the feasibility and accuracy of pre-TACE three dimensional (3D) CT angiography for tumor-feeding vessels detection compared to DSA. METHODS: Sixty-nine consecutive patients referred for TACE from May 2022 to May 2023 were included. (3D) CT images were reconstructed from the pre-TACE diagnostic multiphasic contrast enhanced CT images and compared with non-selective digital subtraction angiography (DSA) images obtained during TACE for detection of HCC feeding vessels. A ""Ground truth"" made by consensus between observers after reviewing all available pre-TACE CT images, and DSA and CBCT images during TACE to detect the true feeding vessels was the gold standard. Sensitivity, specificity, negative predictive value (NPV), positive predictive value (PPV), accuracy and ROC curve with AUC were calculated for each modality and compared. RESULTS: A total of 136 active HCCs were detected in the 69 consecutive patients included in the study. 185 feeding arteries were detected by 3D CT and DSA and included in the analysis. 3D CT detection of feeding arteries revealed mean sensitivity, specificity, PPV, NPV and accuracy of 91%, 71%, 98%, 36%, and 90%, respectively, with mean AUC = 0.81. DSA detection of feeding arteries revealed mean sensitivity, specificity, PPV, NPV, and accuracy of 80%, 58%, 96.5%, 16.5% and 78%, respectively, with mean AUC = 0.69. CONCLUSIONS: Pre-TACE 3D CT angiography has shown promise in improving the detection of HCC feeding vessels compared to DSA.

165,Transradial versus transfemoral access without closure device for transarterial chemoembolization in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma: a randomized trial.,10.1007/s00330-022-09038-1,"OBJECTIVES: To compare patient satisfaction, procedural variables, and safety with transradial access (TRA) and transfemoral access (TFA) in patients undergoing transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). MATERIALS AND METHODS: From February 2019 to August 2021, 130 patients undergoing TACE for HCC were randomly allocated to the TRA (n = 65) or TFA (n = 65) group. Vascular closure devices were not used after TFA-TACE. All patients completed the post-catheterization questionnaire and 8-item Short-Form Health Survey 1 day after TACE. RESULTS: Technical success rate, crossover rate, contrast agent dose, fluoroscopy time, procedure time, air kerma, dose-area product, length of hospital stay, and total cost were similar between the two groups (all p > 0.05). The incidence and severity of adverse events were also similar between the two groups (all p > 0.05). However, overall discomfort, difficulty going to the bathroom, difficulty feeding or self-caring, difficulty walking, general health, physical function, role physical function, social function, mental health, and role emotional function were better in the TRA group than in the TFA group (all p < 0.001). Consequently, more patients preferred the current access for their next procedure in the TRA group than in the TFA group (90.8% vs. 24.6%; p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: In patients undergoing TACE for HCC, using TRA instead of TFA can improve patient satisfaction without compromising procedural variables and safety. KEY POINTS: • Transradial access (TRA) enabled early ambulation after transarterial chemoembolization (TACE), resulting in significant increase in activities of daily living and health-related quality of life (HRQoL) compared to transfemoral access (TFA) when vascular closure devices were not used. • Procedural variables (contrast agent dose, fluoroscopy time, procedure time, air kerma, dose-area product, length of hospital stay, and total cost) were not significantly different between patients who received TRA-TACE and TFA-TACE. • The incidence and severity of adverse events were similar between patients who received TRA-TACE and TFA-TACE.",Zhang X; Luo Y; Tsauo J; Zhao H; Gong T; Li J; Li Y; Zeng H; Sun W; Li X
166,"Neutrophil-to-Lymphocyte Ratio and Early Tumor Shrinkage as Predictive Biomarkers in Unresectable Hepatocellular Carcinoma Patients Treated With Lenvatinib, PD-1 Inhibitors, in Combination With TACE.",10.1177/15330338231206704,"Purpose: The purpose of this prospective observational study was to investigate the relationship between pretreatment neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) and posttreatment early tumor shrinkage (ETS), and clinical outcomes in patients with unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (uHCC) who received lenvatinib, programmed death-1 inhibitors plus transcatheter arterial chemoembolization. Patients and Methods: A total of 63 uHCC patients were treated with this triple combination. Multivariate analyses to determine the independent factors associated with overall survival (OS) were employed. The link between NLR and clinical results was further analyzed. Furthermore, the predictive value of combining NLR with ETS should be investigated to stratify patients receiving treatment for survival benefits. Results: Progression-free survival and OS were 9.8 and 23.0 months, respectively, with a median follow-up of 20.8 months. On a multivariate analysis of OS, NLR was the only independent prognostic factor. Patients with NLR low (NLR < 3.2) had longer progression-free survival (19.3 vs 7.3 months, P < 0.001) and OS (28.9 vs 16.9 months, P < 0.001), higher objective response rate (86.7% vs 39.4%, P < 0.001), and a higher chance of achieving ETS ≥ 10% (ETS high) (73.3% vs 21.1%, P < 0.001) compared with patients with NLR high (NLR ≥ 3.2). The Spearman correlation analysis also showed the strong consistency between NLR and ETS (R(2) = 0.6751). In the subgroup analysis, greater OS benefit was found in the NLR low/ETS high group than the NLR high/ETS low group (χ(2) = 31.258, P < 0.001), while there was no survival difference for patients in the NLR low/ETS low group compared with in the NLR high/ETS high group (χ(2) = 0.046, P = 0.830). Conclusion: NLR has the potential to identify which patients would benefit from this triple therapy, and when combined with ETS, it has the potential to provide greater predictive power in selecting the appropriate candidates for this combination treatment.",Qu S; Wu D; Hu Z

METHODS: Patients between 20 and 80 years of age with 1-3 foci of HCC were selected. Included patients have had primary or recurrent liver lesions with no evidence of extra-hepatic metastasis prior to the study. Patients were treated with ultrasound-guided HIFU alone or HIFU combined with TACE (treated with TACE once within 4 weeks prior to receiving HIFU). RESULTS: Thirty-seven patients were enrolled, for a total of 45 lesions. The 2-year local control (LC) rate was 73.0% and the median LC time was 22 months. The 2-year progression-free survival (PFS) was 29.7% and the median PFS time was 9 months. Finally, the 2-year overall survival (OS) was 70.3%, and the median OS time was 24 months. The most common adverse events (AEs) were elevated liver enzymes, followed by fatigue, and pain, no grade 4 AEs or death occurred. Multivariate analysis showed that age, Child-Pugh class, and the number of tumors were independent prognostic factors for PFS and that the AFP levels and the number of tumors were significantly correlated with the OS. CONCLUSIONS: This study indicates that the HIFU/HIFU combined with TACE treatment is safe, and is capable of achieving both a good LC rate and a considerably good prognosis. The procedure should be considered for patients who were deemed unsuitable for other local treatments.

Conclusion: TACE + (131)I-metuximab showed a greater antirecurrence benefit, significantly improved the 5-y survival of patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma, and was well tolerated by patients.",Chen H; Nan G; Wei D; Zhai RY; Huang M; Yang WW; Xing BC; Zhu X; Xu HF; Wang XD; Zhang XY; Zhu BR; Liu P; Cao G; Gao S; Hao CY; Yang RJ; Guo JH; Zhang X; Gao K; Wang K; Wang JF; Li ZY; Zhu LZ; Ding R; Li J; Zhao L; Shao YJ; Liu HC; Xia JL; Wang L; Kong LM; Chen ZN; Bian H
169,Comparison of computed tomography response criteria after chemoembolization of hepatic carcinoma in dogs.,,"The objective of this study was to evaluate unidimensional (mm), bidimensional (mm(2)), or tridimensional (mL) computed tomography (CT) tumor measurements for ability to discriminate changes in lesion size and predict survival in dogs with nonresectable hepatic carcinoma treated with drug-eluting bead transarterial-chemoembolization (DEB-TACE) and to compare CT response via Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors 1.1 (mm), World Health Organization (mm(2)), ellipsoid and spherical volume (mL), and percent necrosis, for their ability to differentiate treatment responders. This was a prospective, single-arm clinical trial. DEB-TACE was performed to varying levels of blood flow stasis in 16 client-owned dogs with nonresectable hepatic carcinoma. Computed tomography imaging responses were assessed and compared to median survival time. Results revealed that initial, follow-up, or changes in unidimensional, bidimensional, or tridimensional tumor measurements were not associated with survival. Larger bidimensional and tridimensional tumor measurements/body weight on initial and follow-up CT were significantly associated with a shorter median survival time [bidimensional (P = 0.04, 0.016) and tridimensional (P = 0.025, 0.015), respectively]. A higher percent necrosis on initial CT was significantly associated with a shorter median survival time (P = 0.038). Ellipsoid volumetric criteria detected treatment response most frequently; however, response classification was not associated with median survival time. Computed tomography bidimensional and tridimensional tumor measurements/body weight before and after DEB-TACE may help to predict median survival time for dogs undergoing DEB-TACE for hepatic carcinoma.

170,Effect of decoction of Fuzheng Jiedu Xiaoji formula plus chemoembolization on primary liver cancer in patients.,10.19852/j.cnki.jtcm.2022.03.011,"OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effect of the decoction of Fuzheng Jiedu Xiaoji formula (, FJXF) plus chemoembolization (TACE) on primary liver cancer (PLC) in patients, and study the underlying mechanism. METHODS: Patients with PLC who met the inclusion criteria were randomized into case group and control group. The case group was treated with FJXF combined with TACE. The control group was treated with TACE alone. The short-term clinical effect was evaluated; liver biochemistry, liver function index and multidrug resistance-associated indicators were detected. RESULTS: FJXF combined with TACE in the case group significantly increased the disease control rate than TACE alone in the control group (83.3% 61.1%). There was a reduction in the serum alpha-fetoprotein at 8 weeks after treatment in each group, while no difference between the two groups. The same trend can be observed for transaminase and direct bilirubin in both groups. In the case group, it showed a significant increase for albumin at 8 weeks after treatment, while no change in the control group. Multidrug resistance-associated indicators for multidrug resistance protein 1 and p-glycoprotein were upregulated in the case group but remained stable in the control group. CONCLUSIONS: FJXF combined TACE had a better short-term effect than TACE alone in patients with PLC. The potential mechanism was probably associated with alleviated multidrug resistance induced by FJXF. Additionally, FJXF didn't increase the risk of liver damage in the combined therapy.",Tong WU; Zhiyun Y; Yuying Y; Yuyong J; Peipei M; Huimin L; Yehong T; Qiaoli Z
171,Decision-Making Scoring System for the Repetition of Conventional Transarterial Chemoembolization in Patients With Inoperable Hepatocellular Carcinoma.,10.14309/ctg.0000000000000506,"INTRODUCTION: Patients with unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma treated with conventional transarterial chemoembolization (cTACE) have heterogeneous tumor burden and liver function. Therefore, the selection of patients for repeated cTACE is challenging owing to different outcomes. This study aimed to establish a decision-making scoring system for repeated cTACE to guide further treatment. METHODS: All patients with hepatocellular carcinoma who underwent cTACE between 2008 and 2019 were included and randomly assigned into training (n = 324) and validation (n = 162) cohorts. Tumor Size, number of Masses, Albumin-bilirubin score, baseline Alpha-fetoprotein level, and Response to initial cTACE session were selected to generate a ""SMAART"" score in the training cohort. Patients were stratified according to the SMAART score: low risk, 0-2; medium risk, 3-4; and high risk, 5-8. Prediction error curves based on the integrated Brier score and the Harrell C-index validated the SMAART scores and compared them with the Assessment for Retreatment with Transarterial chemoembolization (ART) score. RESULTS: The low-risk group had the longest median overall survival of 39.0 months, followed by the medium-risk and high-risk groups of 21.2 months and 10.5 months, respectively, with significant differences (P < 0.001). The validation cohort had similar results. The high-risk group had 63.1% TACE refractory cases. The Harrell C-indexes were 0.562 and 0.665 and the integrated Brier scores were 0.176 and 0.154 for ART and SMAART scores, respectively. DISCUSSION: The SMAART score can aid clinicians in selecting appropriate candidates for subsequent cTACE. A SMAART score of ≥5 after the first cTACE session identified patients with poor prognosis who may not benefit from additional cTACE sessions. behalf of The American College of Gastroenterology.",Bannangkoon K; Hongsakul K; Tubtawee T; Janjindamai P; Akkakrisee S; Piratvisuth T; Geater A
172,Efficacy comparison of optimal treatments for hepatocellular carcinoma patients with portal vein tumor thrombus.,10.1016/j.aohep.2021.100552,"INTRODUCTION AND OBJECTIVES: Optimal treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) involving portal vein tumor thrombus (PVTT) remains controversial. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 627 HCC patients with PVTT after initial treatment with one of the following at Affiliated Tumor Hospital of Guangxi Medical University: liver resection (LR, n = 225), transarterial chemoembolization (TACE, n = 298) or sorafenib (n = 104) were recruited and randomly divided into the training cohort (n = 314) and internal validation cohort (n = 313). Survival analysis were repeated after stratifying patients by Cheng PVTT type. RESULTS: Resection led to significantly higher OS than the other two treatments among patients with type I or II PVTT. TACE worked significantly better than the other two treatments for patients with type III. All three treatments were associated with similar OS among patients with type IV. These findings were supported by the internal validation cohort. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that the optimal treatment for HCC involving PVTT depends on the type of PVTT. LR may be more appropriate for type I or II PVTT; TACE, for type III Sorafenib may be more appropriate than invasive treatments for patients with type IV PVTT. S.L.U.

This study aimed to investigate the efficacy of Gamma knife radiosurgery (GKR) versus transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (TACE) in HCC patients with PVTT. METHODS: This retrospective study included 544 HCC patients with PVTT (GKR, 202; TACE, 342). Propensity score matching (PSM) analysis identified 171 matched pairs of patients. The primary endpoint was overall survival (OS). RESULTS: Before PSM, the GKR group exhibited longer median OS (mOS) than the TACE group (17.2 vs. 8.0 months, p < 0.001). We followed the Cheng's classification for PVTT. In the subgroup analysis, GKR was associated with significantly longer mOS for patients with PVTT II-IV (17.5 vs. 8.7 months, p < 0.001; 17.2 vs. 7.8 months, p = 0.001; 14.5 vs. 6.5 months, p = 0.001, respectively) and comparable OS for patients with PVTT I. After PSM, the GKR group had also a longer mOS than the TACE group (15.8 vs. 10.4 months, p < 0.001). In the subgroup analysis, the GKR group demonstrated superior mOS for patients with PVTT II-IV (all p < 0.05) and comparable OS for patients with PVTT I. CONCLUSIONS: GKR was associated better OS than TACE in HCC patients with PVTT, especially for patients with PVTT II-IV.

174,A study on prevention of bleeding complications using lusutrombopag for safe RFA in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma with low platelet counts: prospective observational study.,10.1186/s12876-023-02879-0,"BACKGROUND: Platelet (PLT) transfusion was the most practical way to increase patients' PLT counts before invasive hepatic procedures such as radiofrequency ablation (RFA) for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). A novel drug that raises the PLT count by acting on the thrombopoietin receptor has recently become available. METHODS: Lusutrombopag 3 mg was administered daily for 7 days to patients who underwent RFA for liver tumors with low PLT counts (< 50,000 PLT µL(- 1)). We collected demographic data concerning the patients' liver function and PLT counts. RESULTS: Lusutrombopag was administered to 91 patients, with a median age of 71 years (range 51-86). Forty-two patients had hepatitis C, 12 had hepatitis B, 21 had alcoholic liver disease, 11 had nonalcoholic steatohepatitis, and five had other diseases. The median Child-Pugh score was 7 (range 5-11). Thirty-seven patients had stage I tumors, 41 had Stage II, 12 had stage III, and one had stage IV. PLT count was elevated from 4.4 × 10(4) ± 1.4 × 10(4) to 8.6 × 10(4) ± 2.5 × 10(4) PLT µL(- 1). Lusutrombopag administration prevented PLT transfusions in 84/91 patients (92%). No patient had bleeding complications after RFA. One had portal thrombosis after lusutrombopag administration. Patients who achieved PLT counts of > 50,000 PLT µL(- 1) had higher PLT counts before lusutrombopag administration. The degree of splenomegaly did not affect the rate of PLT count elevation. There was no specific adverse effect by administrating lusutrombopag for patients with PLT counts of around 50,000 µL(- 1) but > 50,000 µL(- 1). CONCLUSIONS: Lusutrombopag administration before RFA was effective and seemed to be relatively safe for hepatocellular carcinoma patients with low PLT counts.

175,"Effect and Safety of Prophylactic Parecoxib for Pain Control of Transarterial Chemoembolization in Liver Cancer: A Single-Center, Parallel-Group, Randomized Trial.",10.1016/j.jacr.2021.09.029,"OBJECTIVE: Pain is one of the most common side effects of transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) in patients with unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma. The goal of this study is to compare the analgesic effect among celecoxib, parecoxib, and oxycodone in patients undergoing TACE. METHODS: This prospective study was a randomized, paralleled trial in which 213 patients were enrolled. Patients were assigned at the ratio of 1:1:1 to receive celecoxib, parecoxib, or controlled-release oxycodone 1 hour before TACE (T0) and once every 12 hours for 2 days after TACE. Pain scores, pain intensity, and adverse events in each time interval were evaluated and compared among the 3 groups. RESULTS: The mean pain score 12 hours after T0 in the parecoxib group (2.8) was lower than that in the celecoxib (4.4; P = .001) and oxycodone groups (4.2; P = .005). The number of patients suffering severe pain was 10 (14.7%) in the parecoxib, 25 (36.8%) in the celecoxib, and 23 (32.9%) in the oxycodone groups (P = .009). Twelve hours after T0, the incidence of grade 3 vomiting in the parecoxib group (2.9%) was significantly lower than that in the oxycodone group (17.1%; P = .006). In the multivariate analysis, nonparecoxib prophylactic analgesia (odds ratio [OR], 4.620; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.877-11.370; P = .001) as well as embolization of the gallbladder (OR, 8.666; 95% CI, 2.402-31.262; P = .001) and normal liver parenchyma (OR, 3.278; 95% CI, 1.409-7.627; P = .006) were the independent factors of severe pain intensity 12 hours after T0. CONCLUSION: Parecoxib is superior to oxycodone and celecoxib for pain control with fewer adverse events. Therefore, we recommend parecoxib as a priority strategy for TACE-related pain control. rights reserved.",Lyu N; Kong Y; Li X; Guo N; Lai J; Li J; Zhao M
176,"Study protocol for locoregional precision treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma with transarterial chemoembolisation (TACTida), a clinical study: idarubicin dose selection, tissue response and survival.",10.1136/bmjopen-2022-065839,"INTRODUCTION: Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a common cause of cancer-related death, often detected in the intermediate stage. The standard of care for intermediate-stage HCC is transarterial chemoembolisation (TACE), where idarubicin (IDA) is a promising drug. Despite the fact that TACE has been used for several decades, treatment success is unpredictable. This clinical trial has been designed believing that further improvement might be achieved by increasing the understanding of interactions between local pharmacology, tumour targeting, HCC pathophysiology, metabolomics and molecular mechanisms of drug resistance. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: The study population of this single-centre clinical trial consists of adults with intermediate-stage HCC. Each tumour site will receive TACE with two different IDA doses, 10 and 15 mg, on separate occasions. Before and after each patient's first TACE blood samples, tissue and liquid biopsies, and positron emission tomography (PET)/MRI will be performed. Blood samples will be used for pharmacokinetics (PK) and liver function evaluation. Tissue biopsies will be used for histopathology analyses, and culturing of primary organoids of tumour and non-tumour tissue to measure cell viability, drug response, multiomics and gene expression. Multiomics analyses will also be performed on liquid biopsies. PET/MRI will be used to evaluate tumour viability and liver metabolism. The two doses of IDA will be compared regarding PK, antitumour effects and safety. Imaging, molecular biology and multiomics data will be used to identify HCC phenotypes and their relation to drug uptake and metabolism, treatment response and survival.

177,Hierarchically Positioning Laparoscopic Microwave Ablation in the Therapeutic Span of Early Hepatocellular Carcinoma: A Real-Life Comparative Analysis.,10.1245/s10434-024-16462-8,"BACKGROUND: Laparoscopic microwave ablation (LMWA) has yet to gain a specific place in treatment guidelines for early hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). This study compared the outcomes of LMWA and trans-arterial chemoembolization (TACE) for early non-resectable patients with HCC, taking percutaneous radiofrequency ablation (PRFA) as the reference treatment. METHODS: A retrospective multicenter observational study was conducted, enrolling non-transplantable, non-resectable patients who had early HCC treated with LMWA (n = 658) from Padua and Milan centers, and with PRFA (n = 844), and TACE (n = 425) from the ITA.LI.CA multicenter database. The matching-adjusted indirect comparison (MAIC) method was used to obtain weighted LMWA and TACE populations similar to the reference PRFA population. RESULTS: Laparoscopic ablation showed an excellent safety profile, and MAIC-weighted early postoperative deaths were comparable among the groups. The MAIC-weighted overall survival was similar between the LMWA (1-, 3-, and 5 year survival of 91.0 %, 67.9 %, 47.0 %, respectively) and PRFA (1-, 3- and 5 year survivals of 90.0 %, 64.7 %, 46.6 %, respectively) groups (p = 0.678) and significantly better for the LMWA group than for the TACE group (1-, 3- and 5 year survivals of 84.7 %, 48.8 %, 33.6 %, respectively) (p < 0.001). Weighted multivariate overall survival analysis and competing risk/subgroup analyses confirmed the non-inferiority of LMWA to PRFA and its superiority to TACE. The LMWA- and PRFA-treated patients had a significantly lower risk of HCC-related death (p = 0.004) than the TACE-treated patients (p = 0.001). Conversely, the groups did not differ significantly in terms of non-HCC-related deaths. CONCLUSIONS: The non-inferiority of LMWA to PRFA, its superiority to TACE, and its applicability to a wide range of presentations with few contraindications support its inclusion among radical therapies for treating early-HCC patients.",Cillo U; Caregari S; Barabino M; Billato I; Marchini A; Furlanetto A; Lazzari S; Brolese M; Ballo M; Biasini E; Celsa C; Sangiovanni A; Foschi FG; Campani C; Vidili G; Saitta C; Piscaglia F; Brunetto MR; Masotto A; Farinati F; Trevisani F; Zappa MA; Vitale A; Santambrogio R

METHODS AND MATERIALS: This retrospective study enrolled 60 patients diagnosed with stage B or stage C liver cancer, according to the Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC) staging system, between December 2019 and October 2021. TACE and HVPG measurement (>16 mmHg or >20 mmHg) were performed on all 60 patients, who were randomized into control and experimental (PTVE) groups. All patients were followed up for 12 months. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS USED: SPSS 20.0 software was used for data analysis. The two groups were compared with respect to the initial occurrence time of hemorrhage after TACE, recurrence time of hemorrhage, liver function, TACE frequency, TACE type, and tumor control. RESULTS: The initial hemorrhage rates at one, three, six, and 12 months after TACE were 3.2%, 12.9%, 22.6%, and 48.4%, respectively, in the control group (n = 31) and 0%, 0%, 3.4%, and 10.3%, respectively, in the PTVE group (n = 29). Differences between the groups in terms of initial hemorrhage rate at six and 12 months postoperatively were significant (P < 0.05). The recurrence rates of hemorrhage at one, three, six, and 12 months after TACE were 11.1%, 22.2%, 22.2%, and 33.3%, respectively, in 27 patients in the control group. In eight patients in the PTVE group, the corresponding rates were 0%, 0%, 0%, and 25.0%. The differences between the groups in the recurrence rate of hemorrhage at the four time points were significant (P < 0.05). At six months postoperatively, liver function recovery and remission were noted in eight (25.8%) and 18 (66.7%) patients, respectively, in the control group; these events were noted in 10 (34.5%) and 19 patients (65.5%), respectively, in the PTVE group, and the difference between the groups was not significant (P > 0.05). In the control group, TACE was performed for a total of 94 times on 31 patients within 12 months, including conventional transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (C-TACE, 75.5%) and the drug-eluting bead TACE (DEB-TACE, 24.5%); the objective response rate (ORR) was 39.3%. In the PTVE group, TACE was performed for a total of 151 times on 29 patients within 12 months, with an average of 5.21 times on each patient, including the C-TACE (57.6%) and DEB-TACE (42.4%); the ORR was 60.1%. Differences in TACE frequency, proportion of C-TACE/DEB-TACE, and ORR were significant between the two groups (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: HVPG can accurately evaluate gastrointestinal bleeding after TACE in patients with liver cancer. Early PTVE can significantly lower the risk of gastrointestinal bleeding and help TACE control tumor progression in patients with an HVPG >16 mmHg or >20 mmHg.",Wei J; Hu Y; Yu J; Yin C; Chen G; Jin L

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Forty-three patients with HCC from 4 medical centers were enrolled in this multicenter prospective study. Of these, 41 patients were observed for 6 months following balloon-occluded alternate infusion transarterial chemoembolization. The primary endpoint was the safety of the procedure, and the secondary endpoint was the objective response rate (ORR) of the HCCs at 2 months following treatment. RESULTS: Three patients experienced adverse events, including 1 patient with facial swelling and skin rash, dissection of the celiac artery, and bland portal vein thrombus. No major adverse events were identified. Two (5.3%) patients regressed from a Child-Pugh classification of A to B. The balloon-occluded alternate infusion transarterial chemoembolization treatment achieved a 22.0% complete response (CR) rate and a 73.2% ORR (95% confidence interval [CI], 57.9%-84.4%). In a retrospective analysis of 23 patients with HCCs above the up-to-7 criteria, the CR rate and ORR of the balloon-occluded alternate infusion transarterial chemoembolization were 21.7% and 82.6% (95% CI, 62.3%-93.6%), respectively.

180,Phase I/II study of PexaVec in combination with immune checkpoint inhibition in refractory metastatic colorectal cancer.,10.1136/jitc-2022-005640,"BACKGROUND: Oncolytic immunotherapy represents a unique therapeutic platform for the treatment of cancer. Here, we evaluated the safety and efficacy of the combination of pexastimogene devacirepvec (PexaVec) plus durvalumab (anti-programmed death ligand 1) with and without tremelimumab (anti-cytotoxic T-lymphocyte associated protein 4) in patients with standard chemotherapy refractory mismatch repair proficient (pMMR) metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) in a phase I/II trial. METHODS: Adult patients with histologically confirmed advanced pMMR mCRC, who had progressed on at least two prior lines of systemic chemotherapy were studied in four cohorts. Patients received four doses of PexaVec IV at a dose of 3×10(8) plaque forming units (pfu) (dose level 1) or 1×10(9) pfu (dose level 2) every 2 weeks. Twelve days after the first PexaVec administration, patients received either 1500 mg of durvalumab every 28 days alone or an additional single dose of 300 mg tremelimumab on day 1. Responses were assessed every 8 weeks by CT or MRI. AEs were recorded. The primary endpoints were safety and feasibility. Secondary endpoints included progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival. Paired tumor samples and peripheral blood were collected to perform immune monitoring. RESULTS: Thirty-four patients with mCRC enrolled on to the study: 16 patients in the PexaVec/durvalumab cohorts and 18 patients in the PexaVec/durvalumab/tremelimumab cohorts. Overall, the combination of PexaVec plus immune checkpoint inhibitors did not result in any unexpected toxicities. Most common toxicities observed were fever and chills after PexaVec infusion. Two cases of grade 3 colitis, one case of a grade 2 myositis and one case of grade 3 hypotension resulted in discontinuation of immune checkpoint inhibitor and PexaVec treatment, respectively. The median PFS in the PexaVec/durvalumab/tremelimumab cohorts was 2.3 months (95% CI: 2.2 to 3.2 months) vs 2.1 months (95% CI: 1.7 to 2.8 months; p=0.57) in the PexaVec/durvalumab cohorts. Flow cytometry analysis of peripheral blood mononuclear cells revealed an increase in Ki67(+)CD8(+) T cells on treatment. CONCLUSION: PexaVec in combination with durvalumab and tremelimumab is safe and tolerable. No unexpected toxicities were observed. The combination of PexaVec/durvalumab/tremelimumab demonstrated potential clinical activity in patients with pMMR mCRC, but further studies are needed to identify the predictive biomarkers.

181,Concomitant Medications Alter Clinical Outcomes in Patients with Advanced Digestive Tract Cancer Receiving PD-1 Checkpoint Inhibitors Combined with Antiangiogenetic Agents.,10.1007/s12029-024-01095-7,"PURPOSE: Our study aimed to evaluate the impact of concomitant medications on the response and survival of patients with advanced digestive tract cancer receiving an immunotherapy-antiangiogenesis combination. METHODS: We conducted a three-center observational retrospective study of patients with advanced digestive tract cancer who received programmed death-1 (PD-1) inhibitors plus antiangiogenic agents between March 2019 and July 2022 in China. The patients had one of the three types of primary tumors: hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), colorectal cancer (CRC), and gastric cancer (GC). RESULTS: The study included 352 patients. The most frequently prescribed co-medications were nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) (46.3%), proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) (38.0%), systemic antibiotics (33.8%), and corticosteroids (30.1%). Probiotics had a direct correlation with a higher objective response rate (ORR) (OR 2.4, 95% CI 1.2 to 4.7, p = 0.013). Patients who received PPIs for gastritis/gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) (HR 0.7, 95% CI 0.5 to 1.0, p = 0.045), anticoagulants (HR 0.5, 95% CI 0.3 to 0.9, p = 0.009), and probiotics (HR 0.7, 95% CI 0.5 to 1.0, p = 0.034) had longer progression-free survival (PFS). Patients who received PPIs for gastritis/GERD (HR 0.6, 95% CI 0.4 to 0.9; p = 0.009) had longer overall survival (OS), while patients receiving opioids (HR 1.5, 95% CI 1.1 to 2.0, p = 0.010) had a significantly higher risk of death. CONCLUSION: Patients with advanced digestive tract cancer who were administered PPIs for gastritis/GERD indication, anticoagulants, or probiotics in combination with PD-1 inhibitors and antiangiogenic agents experienced improved clinical outcomes.

182,A prospective observational cohort study of lenvatinib as initial treatment in patients with BCLC-defined stage B hepatocellular carcinoma.,10.1186/s12885-022-09625-x,"BACKGROUND: Transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) is the standard treatment for intermediate stage hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) (Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer [BCLC] B). However, it often leads to a poor prognosis and decreased hepatic function especially in patients with BCLC substage B2. Lenvatinib (LEN) was demonstrated to be efficacious in these patients in the REFLECT phase 3 trial. We therefore aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of LEN as a first-line treatment for the patients with HCC at BCLC substage B2. METHODS: This prospective observational study used LEN in TACE-naïve patients with HCC at BCLC substage B2 and preserved hepatic function. The primary endpoint was overall survival. A one-year survival rate threshold of 60% and an expected survival rate of 78%, based on previous reports of TACE, was assumed for setting the sample size. With a one-sided α-type error of 5% and 70% detection power, 25 patients were required over a 2-year enrollment period and 10-month follow-up period. RESULTS: Thirty-one patients were enrolled in this study from June 2018 to June 2020. The 1-year survival rate was 71.0% (90% confidence interval, 68.4-73.6%). Median overall and progression-free survival periods were 17.0 and 10.4 months, and the objective response rates according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumor (RECIST) version 1.1 and modified RECIST criteria were 22.6% and 70.0%, respectively. Common adverse events (AEs) were fatigue (68%), hypertension (65%), anorexia (61%), palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia (39%), and thrombocytopenia (32%) of any grade; aspartate aminotransferase increased (23%), alanine aminotransferase increased (16%), and grade ≥ 3 proteinuria (13%). Treatment interruption and dose reduction were required in 61% and 81% of patients, respectively. LEN was discontinued in 29 patients due to disease progression (n = 17), AEs (n = 9), conversion to curative treatments (n = 2), and sudden death (n = 1), whereas post-LEN treatments were administered in 18 patients, including systemic chemotherapy (n = 11), TACE (n = 6), transarterial infusion (n = 1) and clinical trial (n = 1). CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that LEN provides treatment benefits as an initial therapeutic in patients with BCLC substage B2 HCC with a safety profile comparable to that previously reported.",Kobayashi S; Fukushima T; Ueno M; Moriya S; Chuma M; Numata K; Tsuruya K; Hirose S; Kagawa T; Hattori N; Watanabe T; Matsunaga K; Suzuki M; Uojima H; Hidaka H; Kusano C; Suzuki M; Morimoto M

However, their broad adoption requires ease of use and demonstration of real-world clinical utility/impact. ORIGAMA (MO42720) is an interventional, open-label, multicountry platform study investigating the clinical utility of DPM tools and specific treatments. ORIGAMA will begin with two cohorts that aim to assess the impact of the atezolizumab-specific Roche DPM Module (hosted on the Kaiku Health DPM platform (Helsinki, Finland)) on health outcomes and healthcare resource usage, and its feasibility to support at-home treatment administration, in participants receiving systemic anticancer treatment. Other digital health solutions may be added to future cohorts. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: In Cohort A, participants with metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), extensive-stage SCLC or Child Pugh A unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma will be randomised to a locally approved anticancer regimen containing intravenous atezolizumab (TECENTRIQ, F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd/Genentech) and local standard-of-care support, with/without the Roche DPM Module. Cohort B will assess the feasibility of the Roche DPM Module in supporting administration of three cycles of subcutaneous atezolizumab (1875 mg; Day 1 of each 21-day cycle) in the hospital, followed by 13 cycles at home by a healthcare professional (ie, flexible care), in participants with programmed cell-death ligand 1-positive, early-stage NSCLC. The primary endpoints are the mean difference in change of the participant-reported Total Symptom Interference Score at Week 12 from baseline (Cohort A) and flexible care adoption rate at Cycle 6 (Cohort B).

185,Construction of a novel disulfidptosis-related signature for improving outcomes in hepatocellular carcinoma: Observational study.,10.1097/MD.0000000000035423,"Disulfidptosis is a novel form of metabolic-related regulated cell death (RCD) that is caused by disulfide stress caused by the accumulation of excess cystine in the cell. Targeting disulfide metabolism imbalance is an emerging strategy for the treatment of cancer. However, it is undetermined how disulfidptosis-related genes (DRGs) influence hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Unsupervised clustering analysis was performed on the TCGA-LIHC cohort to identify various phenotypes of disulfidptosis. GSVA was used to measure the activation of characteristic gene sets, while CIBERSORT was employed to estimate the infiltration of immune cells. Disulfidptosis-related signature was generated to quantify the phenotype of disulfidptosis in HCC patients. Next, we examined the disparities among the high and low disulfidptosis score categories by considering clinical characteristics, infiltration of immune cells, functions related to the immune system, sensitivity to chemotherapeutic drugs, and effectiveness of immunotherapy. Two different disulfidptosis phenotypes with different prognoses, clinical traits, biological pathways, and immune cell infiltration were identified. Based on differently expressed genes (DEGs) among 2 disulfidptosis phenotypes, a disulfidptosis-related signature was built. The prognostic value of this signature was then evaluated in the TCGA and GEO datasets. Low disulfidptosis score indicated favorable clinical outcomes, higher levels of immune cell infiltration, lower tumor purity, and enhanced immune responses. Furthermore, we noticed a clear disparity in tumor mutation load and drug responsiveness when comparing the high and low disulfidptosis score categories. Finally, a quantitative nomogram was built with disulfidptosis score and several clinical characteristics. The disulfidptosis-related signature provides new insights into the tumor immune microenvironment and complexity in HCC. The disulfidptosis score can serve as a promising tool for personalized prognostic prediction of HCC patients and for customizing more effective immunotherapeutic strategies.",Chen X; Liang Q; Zhou Y

METHODS: This was a single centre phase 1 trial to assess the safety and tolerability of PACOX. All the enrolled subjects received treatment in 3-weekly cycles: intravenous PEG-BCT-100 2.7 mg/kg on days 1, 8 and 15 of each cycle; oral capecitabine 1000 mg/m(2) twice daily on day 1-14 of each cycle and intravenous oxaliplatin on day 1. Three dose levels of oxaliplatin (85 mg/m(2), 100 mg/m(2) or 130 mg/m(2)) were studied to define the maximum tolerated dose (MTD). Adverse events (AEs), efficacy by RECIST v1.1, time to progression (TTP), progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) were studied. RESULTS: Seventeen patients were enrolled at 3 dose levels of oxaliplatin: 85 mg/m(2) (8 patients), 100 mg/m(2) (3 patients), and 130 mg/m(2) (6 patients). The median age was 55 years; all had had locoregional chemotherapy or targeted therapy such as sorafenib, but no systemic chemotherapy. The most common AEs were nausea (82%), injection site reaction (76%), palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia (59%), oral mucositis (53%) and vomiting (53%). There was no dose-limiting toxicity (DLT). Median duration on study was 8 weeks overall. In 14 evaluable cases, one achieved partial response (PR), 4 had stable disease (SD); disease control rate was 36%; most responses were observed in the 130 mg/m(2) cohort with 1 PR and 2 SDs. Median TTP and PFS were both 7.0 weeks. Overall median OS was 10.7 months; the median OS was not reached at 19.4 months of follow-up in the 130 mg/m2 cohort. CONCLUSION: The PACOX regimen demonstrated good anti-cancer activity and survival advantage in advanced pre-treated HCC with favourable safety profile. It warrants further phase II/III studies.

This phase I/II study (NCT03637764) assessed the safety and activity of isatuximab plus atezolizumab (Isa + Atezo), an anti-programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) antibody, in patients with immunotherapy-naive solid tumors: epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC), glioblastoma (GBM), hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), and squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (SCCHN). PATIENTS AND METHODS: Phase I assessed safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and the recommended phase II dose (RP2D) of isatuximab 10 mg/kg intravenously (i.v.) every week for 3 weeks followed by once every 3 weeks + atezolizumab 1200 mg i.v. every 3 weeks. Phase II used a Simon's two-stage design to assess the overall response rate or progression-free survival rate at 6 months (GBM cohort). Interim analysis was carried out at 6 months following first dose of the last enrolled patient in each cohort. Pharmacodynamic biomarkers were tested for CD38, PD-L1, tumor-infiltrating immune cells, and FOXP3+ regulatory T cells (Tregs) in the tumor microenvironment (TME). RESULTS: Overall, 107 patients were treated (EOC, n = 18; GBM, n = 33; HCC, n = 27; SCCHN, n = 29). In phase I, Isa + Atezo showed an acceptable safety profile, no dose-limiting toxicities were observed, and RP2D was confirmed. Most patients experienced ≥1 treatment-emergent adverse event (TEAE), with ≤48.5% being grade ≥3. The most frequent TEAE was infusion reactions. The study did not continue to stage 2 based on prespecified targets. Tumor-infiltrating CD38+ immune cells were reduced and almost cleared after treatment. Isa + Atezo did not significantly modulate Tregs or PD-L1 expression in the TME. CONCLUSIONS: Isa + Atezo had acceptable safety and tolerability. Clinical pharmacodynamic evaluation revealed efficient target engagement of isatuximab via treatment-mediated reduction of CD38+ immune cells in the TME.

The safety of autologous iNKT cell treatment in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) has been verified. This study aimed to investigate its efficacy in advanced HCC after transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) failure. PATIENTS AND METHODS: This open-label, randomized, controlled, trial enrolled 60 patients with unresectable HCC after TACE failure at three centers. Transarterial embolization (TAE) was used instead of TACE to protect iNKT cell function. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive TAE therapy with (TAE-iNKT) or without (TAE) biweekly iNKT cell infusion. The primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS). Secondary endpoints included overall survival (OS), objective response rate (ORR), disease control rate (DCR), quality of life (QoL), peripheral blood cell count, and safety. RESULTS: Fifty-four patients completed the study. Median PFS was significantly higher in TAE-iNKT patients (5.7 months [95% CI, 4.3-7.0 months]) compared with TAE patients (2.7 months [95% CI, 2.3-3.2 months]; hazard ratio 0.32 [95% CI, 0.16-0.63]; P<0.001). Higher ORR and DCR were observed in TAE-iNKT patients (52% and 85%, respectively) compared with TAE patients (11% and 33%; respectively). Five TAE-iNKT patients and 1 TAE patient achieved completed response. The median time to deterioration in QoL was longer in TAE-iNKT patients (9.2 months [95% CI, 6.0-13.3 months]) compared with TAE patients (3.0 months [95% CI, 2.9-3.0 months]). The mean lymphocytes were higher in the TAE-iNKT group than in the TAE group at 8 (1.48 vs 0.95×10(9)/L, P = 0.007) and 12 (1.49 vs 0.89×10(9)/L, P = 0.001) weeks. Grade 3 adverse events occurred in 1 TAE-iNKT patient (4%) and 5 TAE patients (19%). All the other adverse events were grade 1-2.

METHODS: American Society of Anesthesiologists Physical Status Classification (ASA) I-II, 30 patients, with liver tumor and planned for microwave ablation (MWA) treatment were included in the interventional radiology clinic, Erciyes University, Kayseri, Turkey, Turkey between 2021 and 2022. Patients were randomized either to the ESPB or control group. Ultrasound-guided ESPB block with 20 mL of 0.25% bupivacaine was performed preoperatively in the ESPB group patients, and the patients who was not performed the ESPB the control group. All the patients were administered 1 µg/kg fentanyl, 1-2 mg/kg propofol, and 1 mg/kg ketamine for sedation during the MWA procedure after standard monitoring. Total opioid consumption and numeric rating scale (NRS) scores for pain were recorded at 0, 20, 40, and 60 minutes, and at 2, 4, 6, 12, and 24 hours after the procedure. RESULTS: Total opioid consumption and total opioid amount during the procedure were statistically significantly lower in the ESPB group (p<0.001). Although all of the patients in the control group needed additional fentanyl throughout the procedure, only 5 patients in the ESPB group needed additional fentanyl (p<0.001). Post-procedure NRS score values were significantly lower in the ESPB group at 40 minutes, 60 minutes and 4 hours (p<0.05). Numeric rating scale values at other times were statistically similar (p>0.05) CONCLUSION: This study showed that ESPB provided effective preemptive analgesia during MWA procedures.",Gergin ÖÖ; Pehlivan SS; Erkan İ; Bayram A; Aksu R; Biçer C; Yıldız K; Kahriman G
190,Imaging features of gadoxetic acid-enhanced MR imaging for evaluation of tumor-infiltrating CD8 cells and PD-L1 expression in hepatocellular carcinoma.,10.1007/s00262-021-02957-w,"BACKGROUND: Tumor-infiltrating CD8 cells and expression of programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD-L1) are immune checkpoint markers in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). We aimed to determine the ability of preoperative gadoxetic acid-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings to predict CD8 cell density and PD-L1 expression in HCC. METHODS: A total of 120 patients with HCC who underwent 3.0-T gadoxetic acid-enhanced MRI before curative resection from January 2016 to June 2020 were enrolled and divided into a training set (n = 84) and a testing set (n = 36). Thirty-four patients with advanced stage HCC who received anti-PD-1 inhibitor between January 2017 and April 2020 and underwent pretreated gadoxetic acid-enhanced MRI scans were enrolled in an independent validation set. PD-L1 expression and CD8 cell infiltration were assessed with immunohistochemical staining, respectively. Two radiologists blinded to pathology results evaluated the pretreated MR features in consensus. Logistic regression and the receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) analyses were used to determine the value of image features to predict high CD8 cell density, PD-L1 positivity and the combination of high CD8 cell density and PD-L1 positivity in HCC in the training set and validated the findings in the testing set. The associations of MRI predictors with the objective response to immunotherapy were assessed in the independent validation. RESULTS: In the training set, the independent MRI predictors were irregular tumor margin (ITM, P = 0.008) and peritumoral low signal intensity (PLSI) on hepatobiliary phase (HBP) images (P < 0.001) for PD-L1 positivity, absence of an enhancing capsule (AEC, P = 0.001) and PLSI on HBP images (P = 0.025) for high CD8 cell density, and PLSI on HBP images (P = 0.001) and ITM (P = 0.023) for the both. The area under the curves (AUCs) of the predictive models for evaluating PD-L1 positivity, high CD8 cell density and the combination of high CD8 cell density and PD-L1 positivity were 0.810 and 0.809, 0.740 and 0.728, and 0.809 and 0.874 in the training and testing set, respectively. The objective response was demonstrated to be associated with the combination of PLSI on HBP images and ITM (PHI, P = 0.004), and the combination of PLSI on HBP images and AEC (PHA, P = 0.012) in the independent validation set.

193,"Efficacy and safety of HIFU in combination with TACE in unresectable pediatric HB: A randomized, controlled, single-center clinical trial.",10.1097/MD.0000000000032022,"BACKGROUND: Hepatoblastoma (HB) is the most common liver tumor in children, and the main treatment for HB is currently surgery. Studies have shown that transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (TACE) combined with high intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) has significant efficacy, but there are relatively few studies on TACE combined with HIFU in China. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effect of using HIFU combined with TACE on patients' liver function impairment and immune function in pediatric HB patients and to analyze the effectiveness and safety. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The clinical data of 110 unresectable pediatric HB patients treated in our hospital from December 2019 to December 2021 were selected as the subjects and divided into 2 groups. The comparison group was treated with TACE, and the combination group was treated with HIFU on the basis of the comparison group. The differences in immune function, survival, treatment side effects and clinical efficacy between the 2 groups were observed. RESULTS: In the combined group, the 1-year survival rate was 100%, the 3-year survival rate was 84.0%, the 5-year survival rate was 16.0%; while in comparison group, it was 82%, 16%, 0%, respectively. The ratio of CD4+/CD8+ in the combined group were significantly higher than in the comparison group after treatment (P < .05). Granulocytopenia, mucositis, thrombocytopenia, and cardiac and renal toxicity were significantly lower in the combined group than in the comparison group, and the effective rate of the combined group was 98.00% which was significantly higher than that of the control group (76.00%) (P < .05). CONCLUSION: Comparative study of HB in children treated with HIFU combined with TACE is more effective, effectively improving the immune level of patients, significantly increasing the remission rate, which can improve the tumor necrosis and improve the survival quality of patients, and is a better choice for HB in children.",Tang X; He X; Jiang H
194,Prognostic Significance of Recurrence and Timing of Recurrence on Survival Among Patients with Early-Stage Hepatocellular Carcinoma in U.S. Clinical Practice.,10.1245/s10434-024-16476-2,"BACKGROUND: Many patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) experience recurrence after curative-intent resection or ablation, with a poor prognosis. Real-world patterns of recurrence and the prognostic significance of early recurrence in U.S. clinical practice have not been well characterized. METHODS: This retrospective observational study was designed to evaluate the impact of recurrence on overall survival (OS) among patients with HCC following initial curative-intent resection or ablation. We used the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results cancer registry linked with Medicare claims (January 1, 2010-December 31, 2019). Eligible patients (≥66 years) diagnosed with HCC (2010-2017) had liver resection or ablation within 180 days of diagnosis. Patients were stratified by recurrence status using diagnosis- and treatment-based definitions of recurrence. Early or late recurrence was defined as within 1 year or after 1 year, respectively. Adjusted OS analyses used multivariable Cox regression models. RESULTS: A total of 1,146 patients were included. During a median overall follow-up of 35.2 months, 736 (64%) patients had a recurrence, of whom 380 (52%) had early recurrence (within 1 year). In the adjusted analysis, patients with recurrence had a 2.24-fold higher risk of death (95% confidence interval 1.85, 2.71; P < 0.001). Patients with early recurrence had a 1.39-fold higher risk of death (95% confidence interval 1.14, 1.68; P < 0.001) than those with late recurrence. CONCLUSIONS: Recurrence and the timing of recurrence are significant predictors of increased mortality risk for patients with HCC following initial curative-intent resection or ablation, highlighting the need for effective adjuvant therapies that may delay or avoid recurrences.",Maithel SK; Wang R; Harton J; Yopp A; Shah SA; Rocha FG; Hernandez S; Cheng S; Ogale S; Tan R

196,"Preoperative Chemotherapy Followed by Hepatectomy for Potentially Resectable UICC7 Stage IIIA, IIIB Hepatocellular Carcinoma; A Phase II Clinical Trial.",10.2739/kurumemedj.MS6834010,"BACKGROUND: The Japanese guideline for therapeutic strategy in HCC does not recognize any benefit of preoperative chemotherapy for potentially resectable hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), and only upfront resec tion is recommended even for an advanced HCC. Data on preoperative chemotherapy for advanced HCC is still limited. Poor prognostic factors of HCC after resection are tumor more than 5 cm in diameter, multiple lesions, and gross tumor thrombosis, which constitute UICC7 Stage IIIA and IIIB HCC. There are no prospective studies about preoperative chemotherapy in these patients. AIM: To evaluate the benefit of preoperative chemotherapy for UICC7 Stage IIIA and IIIB potentially resectable HCC. DISCUSSION: Our recent study demonstrated that the 5-year overall survival rate (OS) of patients diagnosed as UICC7 Stage IIIA and IIIB who had received upfront resection was only 16.5%. In contrast, the 5-year OS of UICC7 Stage IIIA and IIIB initially unresectable patients who had achieved conversion from unresectable to resect able status under successful hepatic infusion chemotherapy prior to resection was as high as 61.3%. Additionally, recent studies reported transarterial chemoembolization achieved outcomes comparable with those of resection. Therefore, we believe that patients with UICC7 Stage IIIA and IIIB should be considered borderline resectable. To evaluate this hypothesis we registered the present phase II clinical trial to assess the benefit of preoperative chemo therapy followed by hepatectomy in potentially resectable UICC7 Stage IIIA and IIIB HCC patients.",Goto Y; Niizeki T; Fukutomi S; Shirono T; Shimose S; Iwamoto H; Kojima S; Kanno H; Uchino Y; Sasaki S; Shirahama N; Muroya D; Nomura Y; Akashi M; Nakayama G; Hirakawa Y; Sato T; Yoshitomi M; Sakai H; Hisaka T; Kakuma T; Koga H; Torimura T; Akagi Y; Okuda K
197,"A multicenter, randomized, parallel-controlled clinical trial protocol to evaluate the safety and efficacy of irreversible electroporation compared with radiofrequency ablation for the treatment of small hepatocellular carcinoma.",10.1186/s12957-024-03614-z,"BACKGROUND: At present, the main clinical application of local ablation therapy, such as radiofrequency ablation (RFA), is to heat the tissue to a certain temperature. However, high temperature will cause thermal damage. Irreversible electroporation (IRE) is a novel minimally invasive local ablation technology for tumors. By high-frequency pulse, the tumor cell membrane can be irretrievably perforated, resulting in the destruction of the intracellular environment, which can preserve important structures in the treatment area. However, there are no randomized controlled clinical trials comparing the efficacy of IRE with traditional local ablation in the treatment of liver cancer. AIMS: This study aims to conduct a randomized controlled clinical trial comparing the efficacy of IRE with RFA in the treatment of liver cancer. METHODS: We will conduct a multicenter, randomized, parallel-controlled non-inferiority clinical trial to compare the efficacy and safety of IRE and RFA for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). One hundred and ninety patients with HCC from five academic medical centers will be enrolled. The patients will be randomized into treatment arm (IRE) and control arm (RFA). The primary outcome is the progress -free survival (PFS) and the key secondary outcome is the Overall survival (OS). RESULTS: Forty-eight patients had been recruited from 5 centers, of which, 33 patients (median age, 59.1 years) with 38 tumors had completed the 1-month follow-up and 21 patients have complete the 3-month follow up, with 2.3 months median follow up period. The mean largest tumor diameter is 3.9 cm. No end point was observed for PFS or OS in both groups, and the complete ablation rate was 100% in both groups. The lesions in the IRE group showed obvious shrinkage 1 month after procedure. One major adverse event (AE) was occurred in the control group. CONCLUSION: This is the first randomized controlled clinical trial to compare the clinical effects of IRE and RFA. The preliminary results suggest that both RFA and IRE are effective in the treatment of HCC, which can provide strong evidence for the use of IRE in HCC and provide more options for the treatment of patients with HCC.

198,Operator radiation dose during trans-hepatic arterial chemoembolization: different patients' positions via transradial or transfemoral access.,10.5152/dir.2022.211327,"PURPOSE This study aimed to compare the radiation dose received by the operator among different patients' positions via transradial access (TRA) or transfemoral access (TFA) during transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). METHODS A total of 120 patients with HCC undergoing TACE for the first time between January and November 2019 were randomized into 4 groups with 30 patients in each group. In group A, patients were placed in the foot-first position with the left upper arm abducted, and TACE was performed via the left radial artery. In group B, patients were placed in the conventional headfirst position with the left hand placed at the left groin, and TACE was performed via the left radial artery. In group C, patients were placed in the conventional head-first position, and TACE was performed via the right radial artery. In group D, patients were placed in the conventional head-first position, and TACE was performed via the right femoral artery. Before each procedure, thermoluminescent dosimeters were taped at 7 different body parts of the operator and the radiation dose was measured and collected after the procedure. The normalized radiation dose was also calculated. Procedural parameters included radiation dose, fluoroscopy time (FT), dose-area product (DAP), and air kerma (AK) were recorded. Patients' demographics, tumor baseline characteristics, radiation dose, and procedural parameters were compared between groups. RESULTS No significant differences were found in patients' demographics, tumor baseline characteristics, as well as in total FT, DAP, and AK. However, significant differences were found in the total radiation dose received by the operator and the doses on the pelvic cavity and the right wrist (P < .05). In group C, the radiation doses received on the pelvic cavity, the right wrist, and the total radiation doses were relatively higher. Significant differences were also found in the normalized radiation doses received by the operator on the thyroid, chest, left wrist, right wrist, and pelvic cavity, and the total normalized doses (all P < .05). Similarly, the radiation doses received by the operator at the aforementioned parts in group C were higher, while those in group A were lower. CONCLUSION No statistically significant differences were observed in the FT, DAP, and AK in TACE via TRA when patients were placed in different positions. However, TACE via the left TRA, with patients in the feet-first position, reduced the radiation dose received by the operator, thereby reducing the radiation risk.",Jiang H; Chen Y; Liao H; Gu Y; Meng X; Dong W
199,Modular multimodal hospital-home chain physical activity rehabilitation programme (3M2H-PARP) in liver cancer: a protocol for a randomised controlled trial.,10.1136/bmjopen-2023-083228,"INTRODUCTION: Patients with liver cancer are susceptible to experiencing a decline in muscle mass and function, which can lead to physical frailty and have a negative impact on prognosis. However, there is currently a lack of physical activity interventions specifically tailored for these patients. Therefore, we have developed a modular multimodal hospital-home chain physical activity rehabilitation programme (3M2H-PARP) designed specifically for patients with liver cancer undergoing transarterial chemoembolisation (TACE). We aim to validate the effectiveness and feasibility of this programme through a randomised controlled trial (RCT). METHODS AND ANALYSIS: 3M2H-PARP RCT will compare a 12-week, modular, multimodal physical activity rehabilitation programme that includes supervised exercise in a hospital setting and self-management exercise at home. The programmes consist of aerobic, resistance, flexibility and balance exercise modules, and standard survivorship care in a cohort of liver cancer survivors who have undergone TACE. The control group will receive standard care. A total of 152 participants will be randomly assigned to either the 3M2H-PARP group or the control group. Assessments will be conducted at three time points: baseline, after completing the intervention and a 24-week follow-up visit. The following variables will be evaluated: liver frailty index, Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Hepatobiliary subscale, Cancer Fatigue Scale, Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale and physical activity level. After the completion of the training programme, semi-structured interviews will be conducted with participants from the 3M2H-PARP group to investigate the programme's impact on their overall well-being. SPSS V.26.0 software will be used for statistical analyses. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Ethical approval has been granted by the Jiangnan University School of Medicine Research Ethics Committee. The findings will be disseminated through publication in a peer-reviewed journal. TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: ChiCTR2300076800. commercial re-use. See rights and permissions.

200,A nomogram model to predict prognosis of patients with hepatoblastoma.,10.1002/pbc.29932,"BACKGROUND: Hepatoblastomas (HBs) are malignant liver tumors that most commonly develop in pediatric patients. Microvascular invasion may be a prognosis factor for patients with HBs. This study aimed to construct a model to predict the survival outcome in HBs. METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed the clinical data of 311 patients with HBs who underwent surgical resection at our institution between June 2014 and August 2021. First, patients were divided into two groups: those who had pathologic microvascular invasion (n = 146) and those who did not (n = 165). Propensity score-matched (PSM) analysis was carried out between the two groups. The preoperative parameters and overall survival (OS) rate were compared between the two groups. Second, all 311 patients were randomly divided into the training and validation cohort in a ratio of 4:1. A nomogram was created in the training cohort to visualize the prediction of OS. Moreover, the validation cohort was used for validation. RESULTS: Multivariate analysis suggested that age, histology type, microvascular invasion, multifocality, distant metastasis, and macrovascular involvement are independent prognostic factors for HBs. The nomogram showed good predictive ability in the training and validation cohorts with a C-index of 0.878 (95% CI, 0.831-0.925) and 0.847 (95% CI, 0.757-0.937), respectively. The calibration curve indicated good agreement between the prediction and observation for one-, two-, and three-year OS probabilities. CONCLUSION: By combining preoperative imaging results and other clinical data, we established a nomogram to predict OS probability for patients with HB, which could be a potential tool to guide personalized treatment.",Ke M; Zhou Y; Chang-Zhen Y; Li L; Diao M
201,Left radial vs right femoral: comparison between arterial accesses in c-TACE procedures in terms of operator radiations exposure and patient comfort.,10.1007/s11547-024-01906-8,"PURPOSE: This multicenter prospective study aims to compare transradial access versus transfemoral access in conventional transarterial chemoembolization (c-TACE) procedures, focusing on operators radiations exposure, patients comfort, technical success and vascular access complications. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients were affected by hepatocellularcarcinoma (HCC) in intermediate stage or previous stages unfit for ablation and/or surgery; they were randomized into two groups according to arterial access site (Group F: right femoral access in standard position; Group R: radial access with left arm abduced 90°). Overall fluoroscopy time was recorded. Eight thermoluminescence dosimeters were positioned immediately before each procedure to monitor radiation doses. Technical success was intended as complete HCC nodules lipiodolization at final plain cone-beam CT. RESULTS: Group F included 23 patients, while group R 19. Mean fluoroscopy time was lower in group F but difference was not statistically significant (p-value > 0.05). In terms of operators radiations exposure, no significant differences were found (p-value > 0.05). Technical success was obtained in 81.5% in group F and 84.8% in group R, without significant differences (p-value > 0.05). Patients discomfort was significantly (p-value < 0.05) higher in group F. Concerning minor complications, no statistical differences were appreciated (p-value > 0.05); no major complications occurred. CONCLUSIONS: In this study, no statistical differences were observed in terms of operators radiations exposure, fluoroscopy time and technical success during c-TACE performed with left radial access compared to right femoral access; patients comfort was significantly better with radial access. These data should lead interventional radiologists to favor radial access in c-TACE interventions.",Giurazza F; Vizzuso A; Capussela T; De Martino F; Pirozzi Palmese V; Giorgetti G; Corvino F; Ierardi AM; Biondetti P; Lucatelli P; Giampalma E; Carrafiello G; Niola R
202,Validation of the 2019 EULAR/ACR classification criteria for systemic lupus erythematosus in an academic tertiary care centre.,10.1136/rmdopen-2023-003037,"OBJECTIVES: To assess the sensitivity and specificity of the 2019 EULAR/American College of Rheumatology (ACR) classification criteria for systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) in outpatients at an academic tertiary care centre and to compare them to the 1997 ACR and the 2012 Systemic Lupus International Collaborating Clinics criteria. METHODS: Prospective and retrospective observational cohort study. RESULTS: 3377 patients were included: 606 with SLE, 1015 with non-SLE autoimmune-mediated rheumatic diseases (ARD) and 1756 with non-ARD diseases (hepatocellular carcinoma, primary biliary cirrhosis, autoimmune hepatitis). The 2019 criteria were more sensitive than the 1997 criteria (87.0% vs 81.8%), but less specific (98.1% vs 99.5% in the entire cohort and 96.5% vs 98.8% in patients with non-SLE ARD), resulting in Youden Indexes for patients with SLE/non-SLE ARD of 0.835 and 0.806, respectively. The most sensitive items were history of antinuclear antibody (ANA) positivity and detection of anti-double-stranded deoxyribonucleic acid (dsDNA) antibodies. These were also the least specific items. The most specific items were class III/IV lupus nephritis and the combination of low C3 and low C4 complement levels, followed by class II/V lupus nephritis, either low C3 or low C4 complement levels, delirium and psychosis, when these were not attributable to non-SLE causes. CONCLUSIONS: In this cohort from an independent academic medical centre, the sensitivity and specificity of the 2019 lupus classification criteria were confirmed. Overall agreement of the 1997 and the 2019 criteria was very good. commercial re-use. See rights and permissions.

204,Study Protocol COVER-ALL: Clinical Impact of a Volumetric Image Method for Confirming Tumour Coverage with Ablation on Patients with Malignant Liver Lesions.,10.1007/s00270-022-03255-3,"PURPOSE: This study aims to evaluate the intra-procedural use of a novel ablation confirmation (AC) method, consisting of biomechanical deformable image registration incorporating AI-based auto-segmentation, and its impact on tumor coverage by quantitative three-dimensional minimal ablative margin (MAM) CT-generated assessment. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This single-center, randomized, phase II, intent-to-treat trial is enrolling 100 subjects with primary and secondary liver tumors (≤ 3 tumors, 1-5 cm in diameter) undergoing microwave or radiofrequency ablation with a goal of achieving ≥ 5 mm MAM. For the experimental arm, the proposed novel AC method is utilized for ablation applicator(s) placement verification and MAM assessment. For the control arm, the same variables are assessed by visual inspection and anatomical landmarks-based quantitative measurements aided by co-registration of pre- and post-ablation contrast-enhanced CT images. The primary objective is to evaluate the impact of the proposed AC method on the MAM. Secondary objectives are 2-year LTP-free survival, complication rates, quality of life, liver function, other oncological outcomes, and impact of AC method on procedure workflow. DISCUSSION: The COVER-ALL trial will provide information on the role of a biomechanical deformable image registration-based ablation confirmation method incorporating AI-based auto-segmentation for improving MAM, which might translate in improvements of liver ablation efficacy. CONCLUSION: The COVER-ALL trial aims to provide information on the role of a novel intra-procedural AC method for improving MAM, which might translate in improvements of liver ablation efficacy.

205,Managing Postembolization Syndrome Through a Machine Learning-Based Clinical Decision Support System: A Randomized Controlled Trial.,10.1097/CIN.0000000000001188,"Although transarterial chemoembolization has improved as an interventional method for hepatocellular carcinoma, subsequent postembolization syndrome is a threat to the patients' quality of life. This study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of a clinical decision support system in postembolization syndrome management across nurses and patient outcomes. This study is a randomized controlled trial. We included 40 RNs and 51 hospitalized patients in the study. For nurses in the experimental group, a clinical decision support system and a handbook were provided for 6 weeks, and for nurses in the control group, only a handbook was provided. Notably, the experimental group exhibited statistically significant improvements in patient-centered caring attitude, pain management barrier identification, and comfort care competence after clinical decision support system implementation. Moreover, patients' symptom interference during the experimental period significantly decreased compared with before the intervention. This study offers insights into the potential of clinical decision support system in refining nursing practices and nurturing patient well-being, presenting prospects for advancing patient-centered care and nursing competence. The clinical decision support system contents, encompassing postembolization syndrome risk prediction and care recommendations, should underscore its role in fostering a patient-centered care attitude and bolster nurses' comfort care competence.",Kang M; Kim MS
